According to popular lore, the birth of Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), one of China's greatest sages, was foretold by an omen that took the form of a mythical horned creature. This hooved beast is believed to have appeared to the mother of Confucius and prophesied the greatness of the child who was to be born.
In his adulthood, Confucius himself chanced upon the same creature when it was captured in a royal hunt. After the encounter, the sage predicted the end of his life; true to his word, he passed away three years later. What is the story behind this sacred chimera that foretold the birth and passing of this famed sage and is today revered by the Chinese as an auspicious symbol?
This beast is the qilin (éº’éºŸ), one of the four divine creatures in Chinese mythology alongside the turtle, phoenix and dragon. Legend has it that the qilin made its first appearance in the courtyard of the deity Huangdi (Yellow Emperor) in 2697 BCE.1
Myriad Versions of the â€˜Chinese Unicorn'
Like many mythological beasts, there is not one single, absolute description of the qilin. It has been depicted in diverse ways, depending on the source.2 The scholar, Jing Fang (77â€“37 BCE), described the qilin as approximately two metres tall and having five colours, including a yellow underbelly.3 Another contemporary, Liu Xiang (77â€“6 BCE), wrote in his book Shuoyuan (èªªè‹‘) that the qilin does not live in herds, does not travel, never falls into snares, is aware of its surroundings and seeks solace on flat ground. The qilin is said to be restrained, humble and unobtrusive.4
More than a millennium later, the Neo-Confucianist scholar, Zhu Xi (1130â€“1200), described the creature as possessing the tail of an ox and the body and hooves of a deer. Apparently, when it walks, it glides over grass, careful not to trample on any insects in its path.5
The depiction of the qilin as a unicorn only began in the Qing dynasty (1644â€“1912). In the Ming era (1368â€“1644), it had been portrayed with scales covering its deerlike body.6 Though sometimes referred to in English sources as a â€˜Chinese unicorn', the qilin may be depicted with one, two or more horns. Contemporary depictions of the qilin usually feature it with one curved horn at the top of its head and two or more smaller horns down its back.
Possessing the head of a dragon, the tail of a Buddhist guardian lion and four goatlike hooves, the qilin exudes a menacing aura and a commanding presence. Yet, despite its aggressive demeanour, there is a gentleness to the creature. The qilin is also believed to be an excellent judge of character, being associated with righteousness, benevolence and virtue.7 
Qilin: Here, There and Everywhere
In Ming-dynasty China (1368â€“1644), nobility and the emperor's sons-in-law wore badges depicting revered, mythical creatures such as the qilin. These badges were also awarded to those who had proven themselves with meritorious or special service. During the reign of Qing Emperor Kangxi (r. 1661â€“1722), the qilin became the emblem of first-rank military officers.8 Each mythical animal of the military rank insignia is said to symbolise the degree of the wearer's courage.9
Besides China, the qilin is also mentioned in ancient Korean legends. King Chumo,10 the founding monarch of the kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCEâ€“668 CE; comprising today's North Korea, northeastern China as well as parts of South Korea and Russia), has been described as riding the qilin during his reign.11 More recently in 2012, North Korea claimed that it had discovered the caveâ€”Kiringul (Kirin's Grotto)â€”that was the supposed lair of the qilin that King Chumo rode.12
Closer to home, the qilin can be seen on the tok wi, a piece of embroidered fabric that is draped over an ancestral altar in Hokkien and Chinese Peranakan homes. Sacred auspicious animals like the qilin are common imagery depicted on the tok wi. The fabric consists of two main sections: an upper panel and a longer lower panel. The former represents life after death while the latter symbolises life in the physical world.13
Interestingly, the mythical qilin also appears in contemporary popular culture. In the 2022 fantasy film Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, a qilin assumes the role of leader among wizards. Director David Yates explained the presence of the qilin in his film: â€œIn the wizarding world of the past, the qilin was called upon in elections: all the candidates would line up, and the qilin would approach each candidate, and if it bowed to one, that would influence the people's choice.â€14
Finally, perhaps one of the most widely seen yet also easily missed qilin iconography is found on the logo of the Japanese beer brand, Kirinâ€”the Japanese word for qilin. In Japanese culture, the qilin is known for its ability to bring about happiness, peace and tranquility.15

Hakka Qilin Dance in Singapore

In Singapore, the most significant representation of the qilin can be found in the form of the Hakka qilin dance.16 Accompanied by Chinese percussion instruments, this traditional dance is similar in form to the more common Chinese lion dance, but here the qilin is the star of the show.
The qilin dance is believed to have its roots in the Qianlong period (1735â€“96) of the Qing dynasty. Historically, the Hakka people subsisted mainly on farming.16 The dance originated as a ritual to cleanse areas where the farmers dwelled and to drive away any evil entities that lurked in the vicinity.
The dance was also performed to invoke clement weather for a good harvest, or to celebrate a bountiful harvest. The Chinese idiom, â€˜å›½æ³°æ°‘ å®‰ï¼Œé£Žè°ƒé›¨é¡º' (peaceful country and favourable weather), is often sewn onto the body of the qilin prop or painted onto the bottom of its head frame.17 It is not uncommon to see Chinese lion dance troupes performing during auspicious occasions such as the Lunar New Year or when seeking good fortune for one's new business or home in Singapore. However, what is little known is that the qilin ranks above the lion. When a lion or dragon dance troupe encounters a qilin troupe during a performance, the dancers will bow as low as possible as a mark of deference and respect to the qilin.18
The qilin dance used to be de rigueur at Hakka celebrations such as weddings, births, the first-month celebration of a newborn and religious festivals. Today, however, there are very few troupes in Singapore that faithfully and accurately perform this dance due to waning interest as well as the demanding skills required. One such troupe that continues to breathe life into this age-old tradition is Yan Wong Cultural Troupe Singapore (æ©éšæ–‡åŒ–å›¢æ–°åŠ å¡), founded in March 2015 by Eugene Wan, who also heads and coaches the troupe.

A Childhood Dream
Eugene Wan's foray into the qilin dance form began as a childhood dream. In 1984, a four-year-old Wan was entranced by a qilin dance performance televised during a Lunar New Year programme from Hong Kong. Some 15 years later in 1999, Wan embarked on his dance journey with a troupe after commissioning the making of a qilin head.
With a deep desire to learn the finer techniques of this intriguing dance, Wan set out on a mission to find a shifu (master). But this was no easy task: few people in Singapore were skilled in the art form.
Wan's quest eventually took him to Hong Kong, and in 2015 he met Master Yeung Chun Mo (æ¥ŠæŒ¯æ­¦; Yang Zhen Wu), the martial arts director of Tsuen Wan North Praying Mantis Gymnasium. Master Yeung specialises in the kung fu style known as Northern Praying Mantis (åŒ—èž³èž‚; bei tanglang). He also created his own qilin dance styleâ€”the Yang Zhen Wu styleâ€”which is known for its exceptionally low stances and fast, powerful movements. Two years after their first encounter, Master Yeung officially took Wan under his wing as a disciple, with Wan becoming the first Singaporean to perform the Yang Zhen Wu qilin dance style.
Master Yeung believes that the qilin is an ascetic that does not kill or hurt living creatures, and is peaceable even while it eliminates evil and harm. Unlike the lion which may come across a snake or a centipede during the dance sequence, the qilin confronts only inanimate objects. While the lion would groom or lick its hooves after a â€˜kill', the qilin does not do that. In the Yang Zhen Wu dance style, the tail of the qilin is not manouvered by the dancer with a string, which is what happens in the lion dance.19

Dancing to the Percussion Beat
In the qilin dance, movements are accompanied by a percussion ensemble made up of traditional Hakka instruments: a gong (é«˜è¾¹é”£; gao bian luo), a pair of large cymbals (å¹¿é’¹; guang bo) and a small drum (å°æˆ˜é¼“; xiao zhan gu). Together, they create a powerful and hypnotic rhythm. But the heart and soul of the qilin dance are the sound of clashing cymbals, unlike the lion dance which is driven mainly by drums. These cymbals measure 45 centimetres in diameter, much larger than the 30-centimetre cymbals used in the lion dance.

Sometimes, a special drum known as the shi gong gu (å¸ˆå…¬é¼“; literally â€˜master's drum') is used during the performance. This drum is believed to contain the energy and essence of all the past shifu (masters). Given its importance, the shi gong gu can only be played by a shifu or someone of an equivalent standing. It is a tough instrument to master, and a high level of skill is required to achieve the precise tone when the drum is struck.

Each qilin performance kicks off with five drumbeats from the shi gong gu. This signifies a mark of respect to elders and an invitation for the late masters to bless the performance. Yan Wong Cultural Troupe's shi gong gu features a talisman that represents the deity qilin tongzi (éº’éºŸ ç«¥å­), who is the protector of the troupe.
Strength and Grace: Qilin Dance Moves
A qilin performance comprises two dancers: one at the front controlling the head and one behind as the torso. Appearing almost ceaseless and unrelenting in their moves, qilin dancers, driven by the propulsive percussion, leap high into the air, kicking their hooves. The elaborate dance is characterised by sudden bursts of movement and surges of energy. Known for being expressive, the qilin's gestures connote surprise, wakefulness, strength, attack and suspicion by turns.
Qilin dancers adopt low stances unlike the lion dance, which is marked by more feline movements. The ability of the troupe is measured by how low a stance the sinewy performers can achieve during the performance. Dancers are trained in endurance and depend very much on the strength of their thigh muscles. Another unique characteristic of the dance is the powerful head movementsâ€”the left-toright motion of the qilin head represents respect to elders.
The most basic stance in the qilin dance is the Sitting Horse (å››å¹³é©¬; si ping ma). The weight of the dancer is centred and evenly distributed, imparting strength and sturdiness as well as stability with each step. The dancer at the front uses both hands to grip the qilin's head tightly; his elbows, wrists and fingers must be strong and flexible in order to create dynamic movements. The dancer's elbows are kept within range of the qilin's head and usually not exposed. Barring certain movements, the head of the qilin cannot be lowered or allowed to fall, and its back must always be parallel to the ground.

Another common stance is the Bowing Horse (å¼“å­—é©¬; gong zi ma), a kung fu stance used for low attack or evasion. In this movement, the qilin's left hooves remain flat on the ground, with both right legs extended, and the dancers' bodies are turned towards the left to face the front. The trunks of their bodies must be stable, aligned with the centre of gravity. The weight distribution should be 70 percent on the front foot and 30 percent on the rear.

Also noteworthy is the Cat or Tiger Stance (åŠé©¬; diao ma). Here, the dancer's front leg is lifted, with the rear leg bearing the weight and his body like a coiled spring. The final stance is the Qilin Step (éº’éºŸæ­¥; qilin bu)â€”a gait that represents both offence and defence. In this stance, each dancer's legs are crossed one over the other. The key to this stance is the coordination of hands and feet as well as a stable gait.

The Art of Making the Qilin Prop
The qilin prop used in the dance is made by a dwindling handful of artisans. The head frame is crafted from bamboo, instead of rattan, for its pliability and strength. As the head frame requires great stability, the bamboo has to be carefully selected. It gives the qilin head its signature asymmetrical shape, while its weight also directly affects the dancers' movements.
The skill of the craftsmen is reflected in the intricate structure of the head frame, which is constructed with numerous bamboo pieces bound together with strips of paper. When the skeleton is complete, layers of paper are glued on using a homemade paste, while ensuring that all the curved parts such as the horns are smooth and even.

When the structure is dry, a white basecoat is painted over before the patterns are drawn in bright colours. Commonly seen auspicious designs include the bamboo, chrysanthemum, plum blossoms and the bottle gourd, which are associated with the qilin's benevolent character. Other embellishments such as bells, pom poms and rabbit fur are also incorporated at this stage.
Arguably, the most beguiling feature of the qilin's head is its eyes. Traditionally, these were made from hollowed-out duck eggshells, but due to their fragility, table tennis balls are now used instead. Sometimes, light bulbs that can be lit up are used in place of table tennis balls.20
Other noteworthy features include intricately painted fish scales at the back of the head and on the body, comprising five colours that represent the five directions: north, south, east, west and centre. These are also known as the five celestial marshal camps that ward off plagues, misfortune and demons.

The Future of Qilin Dance in Singapore
Qilin dance was once a hallmark of Hakka culture in Singapore. If not for the few surviving qilin dance troupes in the city-state, this aspect of Hakka culture would have faded into obscurity long ago. The decline of qilin dance can be attributed to diminishing awareness and interest among the Hakka community, especially the younger generations. For older Hakka people, the dance symbolises the embodiment of the spiritual and the ritual. It is a performance that is said to counter evil, purify, renew and bring blessings to the community.
In spite of the waning interest in qilin dance, it is heartening to know that Yan Wong Cultural Troupe Singapore has recently been receiving members as young as nine years old. There is hope yet that the legend and the qilin dance form can continue to be kept alive in the years to come.

Did you know, there's a hidden canal under Stamford Road that leads to Raffles City? Or, that when Plaza Singapura first opened, rental was only SGD 1 a month!1 Learn about the lesser-known histories of iconic Singapore buildings built by DBS in the 1970 and 1980s. With a mandate to stimulate a young nation's development, DBS started its property development operations soon after it was established in 1968. 
In 1969, DBS Realty was formed as a subsidiary to handle real estate developments and act as real estate agents for clients including the Government.2 In 1981, DBS restructured its property interests and activities under DBS Land3, which was eventually merged with Pidemco Land to form CapitaLand in 2000.4
Read on to discover more fun facts about these buildings.
  1. When Plaza Singapura opened, monthly rental for a shop unit was only SGD 1

  Plaza Singapura was built to introduce Singaporeans to a whole new way of shopping. The high-end family mall concept was untested in the 1970s and would be the nation's first multi-story mall with an anchor tenant.
  The aim: create a successful lifestyle concept so more investors would build similar projects in Singapore.
  Despite the careful planning, the mall's 1974 opening coincided with a global oil crisis that badly affected Singapore â€“ and it was hard to attract tenants and customers to the new mall.5 
  The proposed solution: offer potential tenants a low rent of SGD 1 a month.
  â€œIt was important to bring the crowds in even if they did not buy anything,â€ recounted former DBS Chairman S Dhanabalan. â€œThe bank decided to offer whole shop unit space at SGD 1 per month, for people to display their wares there, as a showroom.â€ 
  When the economy picked up, the scheme was discontinued, and Plaza Singapura exploded in popularity. The number of visitors could reach 110,000 a day!6

  2. Thomson Plaza, a first-of-its-kind mall with barrier-free features

  Plaza Singapura's successful family mall concept was replicated in the heartlands with the opening of Thomson Plaza in 1979 â€“ with a special enhancement.
  Featuring step-free ramps between each level, doors fitted with lever handles for easier opening, and bigger toilets for wheelchair access, Thomson Plaza was among the first public buildings in Singapore with barrier-free features.7
  â€œWe had to think progressively â€¦ This is why we placed an emphasis on comfort, accessibility, and thoughtful design, all in the face of limited budgets,â€ explained James Ng, DBS Land's project manager for Thomson Plaza.
  To further ensure safety, the DBS team requested for authorities to cover up the large drain in front of the mall, inadvertently creating the forerunner of pedestrian walkways that would later benefit shoppers across the island as covered drains and walkways became mainstream.8

  3. Concrete was poured continuously for three days to build Raffles City

  A project of massive complexity, it took 10 years to plan the construction of Raffles City. And the actual construction? That took seven years! 
  The integrated complex included the world's tallest hotel then, the 73-storey Westin Stamford (now called Swissotel The Stamford). Building its mat foundation required 72 hours of continuous pouring of concrete!9 A batching plant was set up nearby to ensure a continuous supply.
  To construct the huge basement of Raffles City, engineers dug through layers of soil and rock. At one section, the ground had so many big boulders, the Ministry of Defence used explosives to blow them up at night.10
  Surrounding areas of the complex also had to be developed, including covering a section of Stamford Canal.  Today, this canal runs under Stamford Road. â€œThat must have been one of the most difficult parts of the project, because Stamford Canal has a lot of utilities connections, cables, and water pipes, among others,â€ said Mr Loh Soo Eng, who held various leadership roles in charge of real estate projects, included General Manager of DBS Land.
  When it opened, Raffles City was credited for its â€œgreat foresightâ€ in successfully introducing the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) concept to Singapore, which stimulated business tourism and enhanced the Lion City's reputation as a premier base for large multinational companies.

  The DBS Building along Shenton Way was Singapore's first 50-storey skyscraper in 1975 and paved the way for other skyscrapers.11
  Due to the size of the building, it had to be built on a very solid foundation comprising four 6.8m-in-diameter caissons12, which were extremely big and sunk in deep into the ground. Their size was necessary to support the weight of the building on less-than-ideal soil conditions, which was a mixture of stiff and soft clay.13
  These caissons claimed the title of â€œgreatest diameter of bored pileâ€ in the Guinness Book of Structures: Bridges, Towers, Tunnels, Dams. Each pile could support a load of over 12,000 tons.14
  The four caissons later inspired DBS' logo.

  5. When Pandan Valley first launched, buyers could sell back their properties at the original price to the developer within 5 years
  Pandan Valley condominium. (Source: DBS Bank)
  Pandan Valley Condominium was developed to introduce Singaporeans â€“ particularly the middle-income â€“ to a brand new (and affordable!) way of living. Prior to this, the main options were either landed property estates or HDB apartments. Still, despite best intentions and an array of facilities â€“ from putting greens to music and ballet schools â€“ the property market went into a sharp downturn, affecting Pandan Valley's sales.
  An innovative offer was thus made to assure buyers they could sell their properties at the original price back to the developer within five years!15
  â€œWe made this offer, as we were confident the market would turn around. It was a signal of confidence, which helped the market recover,â€ recounted Mr Dhanabalan. â€œThe market later picked up, and we didn't have to keep the offer open.â€
  In 1979, two years after its launch, the condominium was almost fully occupied.

The way we dress can reflect how we see ourselves and influence how others perceive us. If so, how has the sarong kebaya evolved and what does it reveal about the place of Peranakan women in Singapore today?

The sarong kebaya is possibly one of the most visible expressions of Peranakan culture, both in Singapore as well as across the region. But the sarong kebaya that communities in Southeast Asia are familiar with is not unique to Peranakan culture. I have used Peranakan culture as the frame of reference in this article as it is the cultural heritage that I am most familiar with (interested readers may wish to explore other sources for insights into the sarong kebaya in the wider Nusantara region1).

Coined in the late 18th century, the word â€˜sarong', meaning â€˜to wrap', refers to a long tubular cloth tied around the waist.2 Kebaya is said to be derived from qaba, a jacket said to be of Turkic origins and worn at least since the 9th century by the ruling elite across the Middle East, Central Asia and North India. Another hint of the kebaya's Middle Eastern origins is found on the garment itself: a triangular patch under each arm of the kebayaâ€”a feature also seen in traditional robes of the Middle East. Ming-style jackets, on the other hand, are flat-cut (without the gusset).

Today, different forms of the sarong kebaya continue to be made and worn by women across Southeast Asia. The garment is so well loved that Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have come together to jointly submit a nomination to inscribe the kebaya on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in March 2023.

As thinkers and writers have previously articulated, clothes do much more than protect our bodies from the physical elements. French philosopher and feminist activist Simone de Beauvoir describes the dynamics between attire and gender in society in her influential book, The Second Sex:3
A man's clothes, like his body, should indicate his transcendence and not attract attention; for him neither elegance nor good looks calls for his setting himself up as object; moreover, he does not normally consider his appearance as a reflection of his ego. 
Woman, on the contrary, is even required by society to make herself an erotic object. The purpose of the fashion to which she is enslaved is not to reveal her as an independent individual, but rather to cut her off from her transcendence in order to offer her as prey to male desires: thus society is not seeking to further her projects but to thwart them.
Inspired by de Beauvoir and other feminists, this article explores what the sarong kebaya reveals or reflects about a woman's place in society.
Form and Function
Many researchers regard the baju panjang (literally â€˜long dress') as the precursor to the more familiar sarong kebaya that we recognise today. The baju panjang is typically a loose-fitting, calf-length tunic with sleeves that taper at the wrists. When paired with an ankle-length wrap or skirt (sarong), the baju panjang is fastened at the front with buttons or a brooch.

It was not just local women in the region who wore the baju panjang or kebaya. By the mid-19th century, European and Eurasian women in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) also began wearing kebaya made of white lace, pairing them with expensive cotton batik sarongsâ€”a sartorial combination that hinted at status and privilege. Some of these kebaya featured lace inserts that provided comfort in the tropical climate of Southeast Asia. 
  Before the mid-19th century, the kebaya was relatively loose-fitting, particularly the versions worn at home or at informal occasions. From the 1850s onwards, however, a version of the sarong kebaya evolved into a tighter, more form-fitting garment.4 This development mirrored the decline of modest Victorian fashion for women in England as well as the gradual tightening of the silhouette as seen in the cheongsam, the body-hugging one-piece dress that was just taking off in China's fashionable cities.

Unlike the baju panjang, the kebaya was shorterâ€”ending at the hipsâ€”and gently nipped in the waist. These minor adjustments had a flattering effect on the wearer's figure, highlighting her curves. The kebaya was also decorated with lace (kebaya renda) or embroidery (kebaya sulam), with the latter gaining greater prominence and popularity in tandem with the rising affluence and influence of the Straits-born Chinese Peranakan community. This led to the emergence of what we know now as the modern kebaya. 
On the other side of the world, the accidental discovery of aniline dyes in 1856â€”the first commercial products of the synthetic chemical industryâ€” revolutionised the manufacture of clothing. Prior to the introduction of chemical dyes, colour in clothing used to carry specific significance. 
This kebaya features the â€˜One Hundred Boys' motif, a popular pictorial subject in Chinese art signifying the wish for many children.The maker, Lim Swee Kim (1933â€“2014), was known for her technical mastery, particularly of designs depicting the human figure.Collection of Peranakan Museum.Gift of Mr A.

Yellow, for instance, was reserved for royalty during the Qing dynasty (1636â€“ 1912) in China, while saffron-dyed robes continue to define monastic orders in both Theravada Buddhist and Hindu traditions today. In Europe, richly coloured garments were worn by aristocrats and the middle class, in contrast to the working class who donned simple garments in dark monotone shades as an implicit form of protest against bourgeoisie excess. 
With synthetic dyes, however, any hue imaginable was now possible with the careful calibration of chemicals. The affordability of aniline dyes also meant that anyone could now introduce colour to their wardrobes, tearing down barriers that once rendered some shades the preserve of certain classes.5
The proliferation of synthetic dyes was accompanied by another watershed development in the garment industry: the birth of ready-to-wear clothing in the 1850s. This was made possible by the invention of the sewing machine in the late 18th century, which in turn allowed for the mechanisation of garment-making. 
However, the kebaya continued to be hand-sewn, in part because it was a traditional skillâ€”alongside other aspects of domesticity such as cooking and cleaningâ€”that were valued by Peranakan women. It was only after the Second World War, when the price of lace increased exponentially, that machine embroidery became more common. Similarly for kebaya sulam, elaborate embroidered patterns with cutwork could now be achieved in much less time. Kebaya designs thus flourished, limited only by the imagination and skill of their makers. From these developments emerged the form of the sarong kebaya as we know it todayâ€”in a diverse combination of colours and embroidered patterns. 
The myriad options of the sarong kebaya enabled women to express their identities through what they wore. Within the Straits-born Chinese Peranakan community, the outfit of a nyonya6 took on great significance. While a baba had access to academic and career opportunities because men were held in high esteem in traditional Chinese society, a nyonya's place in life was one of domestication and cultivated gentility. To a large extent, a nyonya was seen as a reflection of her family's status: she was expected to be submissive and carry herself with appropriate decorum. How she dressedâ€”from the design of her kebaya to how she accessorised with jewelleryâ€”was a public statement of her family's wealth and social status.

The gold and diamond belt above, for example, would have been worn by a nyonya to complement her sarong kebaya. The belt was probably made by South Asian craftsmen for a wealthy nyonya around the beginning of the 20th century. It comprises 18 linked gold pierce-work panels, each bearing the image of a peacock surrounded with a profusion of vegetation. The buckle and smaller side panels feature diamonds of yellow, brown and even orange-pink tints. In the centre of the buckle is a large European-cut diamond set in the body of the peacock. The buckle, which weighs in at nearly five carats, can be detached and worn as a brooch. This is not only an ostentatious piece of jewellery featuring intricate craftsmanship, but was also worn to show off the wealth of the wearer and her family.
Gender as a Social Construct
One of the most quoted statements about genderâ€”â€œOne is not born, but rather becomes, woman""7  â€”is attributed to Simone de Beauvoir. Her statement speaks to how gender identity, as with any other identity one holds, can be expressed and constituted through language, gesture and dress, among other things. 
An example is the literal performance of genderâ€”when dress and costume are used by an actor to assume a different identity. In the novel Orlando, Virginia Woolf writes:8
Vain trifles as they seem, clothes have, they say, more important offices than merely to keep us warm. They change our view of the world and the world's view of usâ€¦ There is much to support the view that it is clothes that wear us and not we them; we may make them take the mould of arm or breast, but they mould our hearts, our brains, our tongues to their liking. 
The construction of gender through sartorial means is central in wayang peranakan, which is traditionally performed by Chinese Peranakan men in Baba< Malay, a creole spoken by the community. This theatrical form was derived from a blend of Chinese wayang (opera) and bangsawan, a popular form of Malay theatre.

Female impersonation was a distinctive feature of wayang perakanan as it was considered improper at the time for Chinese Peranakan women to be seen on stage. Baba performers of wayang peranakan would dress in women's attire such as the sarong kebaya and adopt coquettish poses and high-pitched voices. While contemporary stagings of Peranakan theatre today routinely feature actresses, it is not unusual to find men still taking on the odd female role or two. 
Singaporean thespian Ivan Heng's highly acclaimed performance in 1999 as the titular character in Emily of Emerald Hill was a nod to wayang peranakan. This was a role that Heng has reprised several times since, the last in 2019. Written in 1982 by Stella Kon, the monologue centres on a nyonya matriarch who devotes her life to her family, yet finds that she loses what she loves most in the end. 
In 2019, to celebrate the opening of the Ngee Ann Kongsi Theatre @ WILD RICE, Raymond Wong, a veteran practitioner of Peranakan beadwork and embroidery, created beautiful sarong kebaya outfits for the restaging of the play. To symbolise Emily's resilience through all the hardships she endures in her life, Wong stitched together a kebaya with embroidered chrysanthemums, a flower that blooms even in harsh weather. The outfit was key to Ivan Heng's embodiment of the character of Emily Gan: wrapped in a vividly coloured sarong kebaya, the actor channelled the indomitable spirit of the matriarch to critical acclaim.
Contemporary Expressions of the Kebaya
The sarong kebaya has never ceased evolving; its shape and style continue to change with the passage of time, reflecting shifting societal norms. Needless to say, women in Singapore today have much greater autonomy than in the past. They enjoy privileges that were not afforded to their mothers and grandmothers, such as access to education and opportunities in the workplace. What this means is that many women have the financial means to buy what they want, decide what they want to do and are empowered to express their identities in myriad ways, including fashion. But while there is generally a growing appreciation among younger Singaporeans for their cultural heritage in terms of tradition, food and dress, in an era dominated by fast fashion, does the sarong kebaya still resonate with the modern Chinese Peranakan woman? 
Personally, I believe so. The sarong kebaya remains a highly visible identity marker for me as a Chinese Peranakan woman. While not every person who dons the â€˜nyonya style' sarong kebaya will identify as Chinese Peranakan, it is still a source of joy and immense pride for me to witness how an ensemble of textiles can convey so much about identity, symbolism, artistic expression and exquisite craftsmanship. 
Of course, I also look forward to the day that the sarong kebaya is perceived less as an occasion wear. I see sparks of that when I walk into Kebaya by Ratianah along Bussorah Street and hear owner and kebaya maker Ratianah Binte Mohd Tahir sharing passionately about her work. I celebrate when local and international designers play on the versatility of the kebaya and create inspired works that women can wear any day.9 I find every opportunity to support local makers because weâ€”as a societyâ€”are at risk of losing the technical skills and expertise of our artisans and crafts(wo)men.

Picture postcards were once heralded as embodying the spirit of modernity. But peer more closely at the images they portray and you will see colonial structures of dominance.

An editorial by James Douglas published in the Eastern Daily Mail and Straits Morning Advertiser in 1907 declared the dawn of that century as â€œthe age of postcardsâ€. The picture postcard was described as â€œthe flower and crown of the modern spiritâ€.1 Although largely satirical in tone, the writer was not far off the mark in his description: by the early 20th century, postcards were so widely produced and used that one could conclude that they had truly taken the world by storm.
  The postcard came into being in the late 19th century thanks to the technology of cameras and films, and the subsequent proliferation of photography studios. Picture postcards first appeared at the Paris Exhibition of 1889; by 1915, these nifty oblong-shaped paper products had become a feature of everyday life.2 Between 1894 and 1919, an astounding 140 billion postcards were mailed globally. In Singapore alone, 250,000 postcards were produced in 1924 by camera-maker Houghton Butcher (Eastern) Ltd whose office was located in Camera House on Robinson Road.

The ubiquity of the postcard also meant that images were easily circulated across the globe, reproducing new social and cultural contexts for their recipients and viewers. Postcards by Houghton Butcher (Eastern) Ltd were featured in the Malaya Pavilion at the 1924 Empire Exhibition in Wembley. Aimed at showcasing the achievements of British colonial governance, the Empire Exhibition displayed artefacts, trade samples and native people from the colonies for public viewing. Postcards became a significant medium for depicting subjects, places, activities and scenes of faraway colonised places that ordinary Europeans could access, albeit vicariously.
  Scholars have argued that postcards were employed as objects of imperial dominance.3 These were visual products that had the power to signify, encode and legitimise imperial expansion.4 In archives and libraries all over the world, there exist enormous collections of postcards depicting â€˜ethnic' typesâ€”a form of colonial classification that excluded Europeans. The immense popularity and wide circulation of these postcards, whether advertently or not, helped define ethnic and racial categories within the mould of coloniser and the colonised.
  A Vehicle for Vice
As the postcard grew into a commodity of mass consumption, interestingly, it also became a vehicle for vice and moral offencesâ€”particularly, obscenity. While picture postcards of idyllic beaches, exotic landscapes and vernacular architecture sold well enough, the ones that proved more lucrative were of women in sexualised or nude poses. By the 1900s, there were reports in Singapore of sellers and private distributors of postcards who had been charged with possessing obscene materials in the form of picture postcards.
  In 1927, the Johor police seized a collection of postcards, â€œmostly of naked womenâ€, which two men had attempted to sneak into Johor from Singapore. In his statement, the judge wrote that â€œMalays were very susceptible in these mattersâ€, and gravely disapproved of â€œthe exhibition of the female form in a naked stateâ€.5
  But the law was not so clear: some of these postcards were in fact permissible. Two decades earlier in 1907, a man was prosecuted for possessing such postcards. The prosecutor said that the accused was found to be selling â€œpictures of unlovely foreign women with nothing particular on, and the defence did not contend they were scientific [emphasis added]â€.6 Thus, under the guise of â€˜science', one could print and reproduce photos of locals even if they were nudesâ€”as long as the subjects were not Europeans.
  Unsurprisingly, such was the thinking at the zenith of the British Empire: the pseudo-ethnographic style of images of colonised peoples, including the â€œunusual, taboo, and eroticâ€, was deemed to serve a scientific functionâ€”that is, the construction of a colonial storehouse of knowledge about native subjects. Photographs in library collections were often captioned with the phrase â€œon behalf of scienceâ€ to legitimise their circulation and consumption.7
  Alternative Ways of Seeing
Postcards were a form of colonial-driven transmission of ideas and consciousness, and their popularity coincided with the peak of European colonial domination from the late 19th century to the early decades of the 20th century. Thus, the study of postcards is very much a study of power and agency. Agency in this context refers to an individual's capacity to act according to their will in a given situation. The images printed on postcards can also be seen as an extension of orientalismâ€”an intellectual tradition of the West that involved the study of the peoples and cultures of Asia and the Middle East and which often perpetuated racial stereotypes.
  Fig. 2: Postcard with an assembly of snapshots captioned ""Malay beauties"" and ""Tamil"", circa 1902. The first three photos depict the same woman in different poses, while the fourth is of a Sikh Punjabi man, erroneously identified as a ""Tamil"". Collection of National Museum of Singapore
Inaccuracy and misrepresentation were par for the course. For instance, a postcard from Penang dated 1902 features the captions â€œMalay beautiesâ€ and â€œTamilâ€ (Fig. 2). However, pictured on the postcard are in fact the same woman in three different poses, while the â€œTamilâ€ man is actually a Sikh Punjabi. Postcards such as this one were not bound by any standards for accuracy and truth; instead, they were often produced for their curiosity value and to satisfy Western desires to consume the â€˜exotic' and â€˜strange' from other lands, in particular, of colonised peoples.
  In another typical colonial-era postcard, we see a woman with her arms clasped behind her head, labelled simply as â€œMalay womanâ€ (Fig. 3). The return address scribbled on the card is in Shanghai, although it is postmarked in Singapore. That such a postcardâ€” bearing a supposedly definitive idea of what constitutes a â€˜Malay woman'â€”had travelled halfway across the globe shows the circulatory power of this medium. This in turn perpetuates the singular, monolithic notion of the â€˜Malay woman'.

Inadvertently, the invention of the camera8 and the ability to reproduce images also helped cement the dominance of the male gaze. There were few women photographers back then. In many of these postcards, women in the colonies were portrayed as erotic, uninhibited sexual objects.
  In examples of photographed women from West Africa, Morocco, Fiji, Indo-China and Japan, subjects are often captured in poses that are almost entirely alike in terms of their objectification of women and girls as sexualised bodies. The subjects either appear in the nude or partially so, or pose in sexually alluring positions, against backgrounds depicting local objects to represent their distinct racial â€˜types'. A woman from French Indo-China, for instance, might be pictured holding a fan.

A postcard produced in Singapore featuring a bare-chested woman is captioned â€œA Malay Woman from Javaâ€ (Fig. 4). The woman is classified and typified as belonging to a racial category, with the added identifier of place. Such a label is meant to suggest the â€˜scientific' basis of photographing natives in the nudeâ€”an attempt to legitimise such overtly sexualised representation as an exercise in knowledge-making. The power dynamic between coloniser and the colonised manifests itself starkly in such photographic images through the authoritative photographer and the compliant photographed subject. Today, as we view these images from a vantage standpoint, from another era and embedded in a different social and political structure, how can we retain or reclaim the agency of the photographic subjects? How can one seek new ways of reading these images so that stereotypical, harmful ideas of women can be questioned and contested, or even inverted? There are two ways we can do this.
  The Inverted Gaze
The first approach is to invert the gaze of the photographer to the gazeâ€”or, in some instances, even glareâ€”of the subject. By doing this, we demote the power of the photographer by returning agency to the subject who is staring straight into the camera lens.
  In a postcard (Fig. 5) captioned â€œMalay woman, Singaporeâ€, a woman wearing a shawl stares directly into the camera lens without the faintest trace of a smile. In fact, one may interpret her gaze as unfriendly or even angry. We cannot be sure that the subject's pose was composed at the behest of the photographer, but we can at least read her facial expression in ways that reclaimâ€”or misrecognise9â€”the usual impression of a â€˜Malay', â€˜Islamic' or â€˜modest' woman through the sartorial symbols of the veil and kebaya (a tunic with long sleeves).

In Figure 6, a young woman is depicted naked from the waist up while sitting at the edge of a chairâ€”a pose that perhaps denotes some hesitation or nervousness. But we also sense that the woman is looking accusingly at the camera; reading more deeply into the image, one may perhaps even sense the subject's simmering anger at being possibly coerced into posing in this manner.

Figure 7 shows a photograph of a trio of older women. Both the seated women stare intensely into the camera, while the woman standing between them looks sideways. We may deduce the hierarchical social status of the women: the pair seated are in a position of authority and the woman standing is in their service. With their seated poses and arms placed confidently at their sides, the gaze of the two dominant women is fixed, appearing almost defiant.

Dialogical Encounter
The second approach to re-reading images is to use a comparative device. In this method, selected photographs are placed together such that they generate multiple meanings, depending on how they are grouped. From this, we are able to tease out critical dialogues or narratives from these photographic encounters.

Fig. 9: A postcard of a Sundanese woman sitting on a rock, undated. The back of the postcard is captioned â€œSeroendeneeche vrouwâ€ (Dutch for â€œSundanese womanâ€). Farish Noor Collection, courtesy of Malaysia Design Archive
When studied side by side, Figures 8 and 9 invite comparison about their enmeshed notions of sensuality and modesty. Both women adopt the same pose: sitting on a rock, with their bodies leaning forward slightly. Perhaps the photographer meant to highlight the sensual character of native women, particularly so in Figure 8 where the subject is dressed in a sarong that reveals her cleavage.
  A sarong worn in this manner is known as the berkemban, typically only seen in informal settings such as bath times or when cooling off in the surrounds of the home, among family and friends. In this postcard, however, the berkemban has been reconstituted to exoticise and sexualise the subject. The staged artificiality of the image is further highlighted by her jewelleryâ€”necklace and bangles are used to add beauty and charm to the subject when in reality she would have removed these for practical reasons.
  Compare this with the subject in Figure 9 who wears a kebaya and thus appears very modest. The use of women's bodies to imprint the sensibility of the timesâ€”one captured at the height of colonialism in the early 20th century and the other at the dawn of postcolonialism in 1950sâ€”is starkly represented in the pairing of these two images.

Fig. 11: Postcard of three youthful women clad in sarong, early 20th century. Collection of National Museum of Singapore
In Figure 10, we may read strength and authority in the faces and postures of these three older women; it is almost as if they are defying the set poses typically suggested by the photographer. They are standing matter-of-factly without their shoes on, no suggestion of a smile on their faces, and staring straight into the camera. Although they are labelled as â€œMalay Womenâ€, their facial features suggest they may in fact be Chinese Peranakan.
  The trio of younger women in Figure 11, on the other hand, are clad only in sarong and appear to be in artificially staged poses that hint at sensuality. When we place these two images side by side, we can feel the power of the piercing stare of the three older womenâ€”most obviously directed at the photographer, but we can also imagine the older set of women looking askance at the younger women.

Together, Figures 12 and 13 make for a pleasing comparison or complementarity. It is likely that these photographs were taken around the same time, circa 1890s: it was fashionable then for Malay women to wear a veil made of a diaphanous material and ever so slightly sweep the hair over the forehead. Through their elegant attire and poses, both women seem to exude an aura of modesty, pride and dignity. When placed side by side, one can almost sense the way they are â€˜looking' at each other, as if silently communicating mutual reassurance.
  Reclaiming Dignity
Postcards provide historical clues about people, places, dressing and habits. These are artefacts that enrich the layers of historical knowledge that we accumulate of the past. Postcards may also be looked upon as a nostalgic material culture that is part of heritage preservation.
  Yet, it is important to recognise that still images captured by the camera have for the longest time served as a basis for the construction of inaccurate perceptions and opinions, stereotypes and half-truths of those being studied, while affording those who engage with them the legitimacy of â€˜science'.
  The two methods of interpreting images described in this article â€”the inverted gaze and the dialogical encounterâ€” enable us to puncture entrenched colonial and patriarchal fantasies built around the construction of Malay women's frailties, fragilities and femininities as captured in photographic images. Through these alternative ways of seeing, we come to treat the images not as passive artefacts, but as a means to reclaim the dignity of the people who have been silenced, misrepresented or oppressed under various structures of colonial dominance and coercion.
  Being and Becoming: Of Femininities in the Malay World Through 50 Images
Fig. 14: Landing page of the exhibition, featuring the three themes of Body, Space and Activity.
As part of the research project entitled â€˜Being and Becoming Female in the Malay World: Interrogating and Curating the Photo-Archives of Early Singapore' supported by the National Heritage Board, an online exhibition titled Being and Becoming: Of Femininities in the Malay World Through 50 Images was held from 12 Mayâ€“31 August 2022.
  Through the curation of 50 iconic images, the exhibition invited audiences to reflect on the themes of colonialism and imperialism, as well as the origins of gender and ethnic classification. It also provided an opportunity for viewers to reflect and contemplate on the images and form their own personal insights. Covering the region of present-day Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, the photographs were sourced from collections of archival images from the mid-1800s to the 1950s.
  The interactive website was anchored on three major themes: Body, Space and Activity. The first theme, Body, questioned the power of the camera to frame and capture the subject. Based on the images, viewers were encouraged to reflect on the body as a site of social construction and inscription. By observing the subjects' phenotype, skin colour, posture, expression, dress (or lack of), ornaments, accessories and compositional frames, audiences were led to read and question each representation.
  The theme on Space examined how choices of interior/domestic, architectural and urban settings frame bodies and identities in the photographs. Besides acting as a backdrop, space has the ability to project the image's intended narrative within which the subject is meant to be understood.
  Activity, the final theme, featured photographs of women working in and outside the household. The work performed by women then, as it is today, played a significant role in generating income for the household.
  There were three interactive segments in the exhibition comprising multiple-choice, compare and contrast, and open-ended questions. By aggregating the responses received, researchers gained some understanding of certain perceptions of femininityâ€”stereotypes, for exampleâ€”that have persisted to this day.
  For instance, in one compare and contrast question, viewers were asked to comment on two photographs of women (Fig. 15) dressed in Burmese attire and holding what appears to be a cheroot (a type of cigar) between their fingers. Most viewers found the images to be â€œjarringâ€. From this, we can surmise that many viewers were discomfited by the image of a traditional Asian woman in native dress engaging in an action that is usually associated with malenessâ€”smoking. But it was in fact quite common for women in some societies to smoke in those days.
Fig. 15: Viewers were asked to weigh in on a pair of images depicting women dressed in Burmese attire and holding a cheroot (a traditional cigar that is open at both ends).
In another example featuring two photographs, each depicting a trio of women, respondents were asked which image better represented the â€œessence of Malay femininityâ€ (Fig. 16). Viewers gravitated towards the photograph of the three lithe, bare-shouldered and sarong-clad young women whose poses (and faces) were averted from the gaze of the camera. The clear-cut popularity of this image when compared to the otherâ€” depicting three older women in full kebaya and baju kurung (a knee-length blouse worn over a skirt), all staring straight into the cameraâ€”implies that femininity today is still associated with youthful beauty, a slender body shape and a coy demeanour.
  Fig. 16: A compare and contrast question on how viewers perceived Malay femininity.
By engaging the public during the virtual exhibition and soliciting their responses, this virtual exhibition has contributed to the scholarship of how femininity in the Malay world has been represented through colonial photography.

What's it like to manage museum exhibitions? We interview Muhammad Noor Aliff Bin Ghani, Assistant Director (Collections & Exhibitions) at the National Heritage Board, to find out more about his work behind the scenes in bringing history to life for museum visitors.
MUSESG Volume 16 Issue 2 - July 2023
Read the full MUSE SG Vol 16, Issue 2.
Muhammad Noor Aliff Bin Ghani, an Assistant Director (Collections & Exhibitions) of Heritage Institutions at the National Heritage Board (NHB), manages the collections and exhibitions of the Malay Heritage Centre, Indian Heritage Centre, and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.
Aliff is responsible for the execution of special exhibitions. This entails managing exhibition schedules, developing exhibition designs, and dealing with conservation and display matters, to fabrication and site renovation, installation of artefacts and gallery maintenance.
The exhibitions he has produced include the Peranakan Museum's Great Peranakans (2015), Asian Civilisations Museum's (ACM) Angkor (2018), Malay Heritage Centre's Cerita (2022) and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall's Connections Across Oceans (2023). He was also heavily involved in the refresh of ACM's permanent galleries from 2015 to 2021 and the recent revamp of the Peranakan Museum. Currently, he is working on the Indian Heritage Centre's upcoming special exhibition Ente Veedu, My Home: Malayalees in Singapore and the revamp of the Malay Heritage Centre's galleries.
Aliff introduces MUSE SG to the behind-the-scenes world of producing an exhibition and walks us through the many steps that take place before its opening day.
Watch: Meet Collections & Exhibitions Manager Aliff
    01. HI, ALIFF! PLEASE TELL US WHAT DREW YOU TO THIS FIELD.
  Perhaps I can start by explaining how NHB entered my life. After graduating with a marketing management degree in 2010, I started an internship at NHB's Facilities Marketing department. When my internship ended, I found a full-time position at the National Museum's Philanthropy department where I helped raise funds for the museum by organising gala dinners and raising cash and in-kind sponsorships. I subsequently moved to ACM in the same role. 
  In 2014, there was an opening in ACM's Exhibitions division and I thought to myself, â€˜Why not?' Of course, it would be a 180-degree change. As part of my job at the Philanthropy department, I was used to dressing smartly to attend events like high teas and dinners to pitch proposals to the museum's donors. But I felt that time was ripe for a change; I was ready to â€˜get my hands dirty'. Hence I switched to being an exhibitions manager, working together with curators and conservators to produce and organise exhibitions as well as set up galleries.
  02. MANY OF US WOULD HAVE VISITED A MUSEUM EXHIBITION BEFORE, BUT FEW KNOW WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES. CAN YOU SHARE WITH US THE WORK YOU DO AS AN EXHIBITION MANAGER?
  There is a great deal of planning that goes into an exhibition. This area of work requires technical knowledge, analytical planning and critical thinking skills as well as attention to the minutest of details. Curators provide the content and may have a display â€˜wish list'. They may envision, for example, a particular piece of textile to be â€˜floating' vertically when displayed. I take this suggestion to the conservators to find out if such a mode of display is practical and can be executed, but more importantly whether It would damage the artefact. After discussing and brainstorming ideas with the exhibition designer, we advise curators on the most feasible and safest way to display the object. As a team, we try to give meaning to the display and contextualise it. This helps provide the best experience for audiences and enables them to fully appreciate the artefacts.
  One example is the traditional Chinese Peranakan kitchen setting at the Peranakan Museum's Ceramics Gallery. Typically, we display porcelainware such as the kamcheng (a type of covered porcelain jar), ornate glazed ceramic wall tiles and traditional kitchen implements like the batu giling (grindstone). But how can we integrate all these artefacts into a meaningful yet dynamic display? For example, can we show the kamcheng in such a way as if someone is opening its lid without compromising the integrity and safety of the artefact? In order to achieve the ideal result, we work with specialists such as the mounting team.
  Also, one of the last touches for a display is lighting. As illumination can accentuate the features of an object and â€˜bring it to life', we study how to stage the artefact using directional lighting like spotlights and under-shelf lamps.
  Aliff checking the light intensity that an artefact is exposed to using a lux meter. Excessive lighting can cause damage to artefacts.
When producing an exhibition, I ensure accessibility by adhering to the principles of universal designâ€”in other words, â€˜design for all'. This means that the design of products, architecture and environments is attuned to the needs of as many people as possible, regardless of ability or age. The physically challenged, children and elderly, for example, should all be able to experience the exhibition with ease. For instance, showcases are set at a certain angle and height so that everyone can view them easily. Text size and font type used in the accompanying displays are also given significant consideration to ensure their legibility.
  A key aspect of exhibition work is the care and maintenance of exhibits. Our work does not stop once an exhibition is launched. After the grand opening fanfare, the team carries out regular checks and maintenance of the artefacts, such as surface cleaning and preventive conservation work. I also ensure that other aspects of an exhibition run smoothly, such as security, climate environmental monitoring and light management. Gallery maintenance is usually scheduled on Mondays when the Heritage Institutions are closed to the public to minimise disruption to visitors.
  Finally, another aspect of my work is collections management. We may at times have to borrow rare items from overseas and local institutions or lenders for an exhibition. In such cases, I oversee the entire loan process, including freight, logistics, insurance, legal paperwork, commissioning custom-made crates for the artefacts for transport, packing, courier management and so on. There are even occasions when supervision on the airport tarmac is required; staff will then have to ensure that artefacts are loaded or unloaded carefully onto the plane so that nothing is damaged while in transit.
  03. CAN YOU TELL US MORE ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE AND CARE OF EXHIBITIONS?
  There are many considerations when deciding how each artefact is to be displayed, depending on its size, material and fragility. One of the key elements in any exhibition is lighting. We have to ensure that the lighting is sufficiently bright for viewers. However, harsh light can also damage artefacts, particularly those made of paper and textiles. Materials may tarnish or pigments and ink may fade over time when inappropriate lighting is used. Therefore, we have to regularly check the displays with a lighting meter that provides readings for brightness and ultraviolet intensity.
  Aliff checking for grime and any other anomaly on displayed artefacts. Gallery maintenance is usually carried out on Mondays when the Heritage Institutions are closed to the public to minimise disruption.
Another crucial factor is the relative humidity in the display cases. The presence of moisture and fluctuations in humidity can wreak havoc on an artefact, causing paper to warp and materials like metals to degrade due to rust, corrosion and even mould. To cite a very relatable example: during Singapore's partial lockdown at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, shops selling leather goods like shoes and bags had to contend with mouldy stock when they reopened. The culprit was unstable humidity levels caused by the extended absence of air-conditioning in the closed shopping centers.
  Humidity levels have to be kept in check in order to prolong the lifespan of our artefacts. Besides being airtight, each display case is equipped with a data logger that tracks the relative humidity and temperature of the microenvironment. We maintain the humidity level by using a moisture-sensitive silica material that absorbs moisture and condensation from the surrounding environment. Some artefacts are on open display, meaning they are not kept within glass cases, which makes them particularly prone to dust. For these artefacts, we surface-clean them regularly with a conservation-grade vacuum and brushes.
  Aliff putting Art-Sorb into a special â€˜oven' to calibrate their humidity control. Art-Sorb is exhibition-grade silica material that is placed within showcases to regulate humidity levels.
04. WHAT ARE SOME NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR MATERIALS EMPLOYED IN EXHIBITIONS IN RECENT YEARS?
  Exhibition showcases have vastly improved in quality. One of the bugbears in exhibitions used to be the reflective surfaces of glass display cases, which tended to get in the way of visitors viewing the artefacts comfortably and clearly. These days, we use non-reflective glass for an optimal viewing experience. Similarly, we now have access to seamless large vertical glass panels which were not available before. In the past, the glass panels used for showcases had seams and joints that disrupted the visitor experience.
  Thanks to hydraulics technology, these large glass panels and doors can now be opened and closed easily. The opening mechanism of showcases as well as their general aesthetics have also become a lot sleeker and more sophisticated. Gone are bulky parts and heavy hinges; these days, showcases can be opened with just the touch of a button.
  Another development in showcase design is the installation of concealed projectors and speakers behind glass boxes. This enables us to project images and include sounds to create a more immersive experience for audiences. Static objects can now be augmented with interactive media to enhance their content.
  These advancements in material engineering and technology have greatly expanded the possibilities in exhibition-making.
  05. CAN YOU SHARE WITH US A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE IN THE COURSE OF YOUR WORK?
  In 2018, I carried out a â€˜door-to-door' courier service to return loaned artefacts to the MusÃ©e Guimet in Paris. The crated artefacts were statues from the ancient Burmese empire that had been displayed at ACM's Angkor exhibition. As a courier I was responsible for the artefacts, so I had to make sure I was always physically present with them.
  The journey spanned a total of 25 nerve-wracking hours! My day at ACM began at 5am when I loaded the artefacts onto the air-ride truck. This is a special vehicle that uses an air suspension mechanism to provide a smooth ride and minimise any abrupt movements to the priceless cargo. An hour later, I reached the airport. There, all 42 crates containing the artefacts were loaded securely onto the plane; throughout the trip, I never let the crates out of my sight.
  It was not a straightforward journey to Paris as we were travelling on a cargo plane. There was a three-hour stopover at Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates where the plane collected more cargo. At this point, there were also horses being boarded onto the plane, accompanied by their breeders! While the breeders checked on their horses, I checked on my crates.
  From Sharjah, it was another eight hours or so to London for another stopover. There, I checked on the crates again. At last, the plane landed at its final destination, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, where all precious cargo was unloaded. Then it was a land transfer to Paris via another air-ride truck. Five hours later, I arrived at the MusÃ©e Guimet safely with the crates, finally concluding my 25-hour courier duty. It was only then that I was able to breathe again!

06. WHAT DO YOU ENJOY OR FIND MEANINGFUL ABOUT YOUR WORK?
  Just as every exhibition is different, no two curators or conservators are the same. As an exhibition manager, I work very closely with a team of very talented people: curators, conservators, collection managers, exhibition designers and other specialists such as mounters, lighting technicians and art handlers. My job not only requires technical expertise, but also soft skills like people management.
  As much as on-the-job training is important, it can never be sufficient. As the museum landscape is ever-evolving, I keep abreast of new advancements and technologies to discover new and innovative ways of doing things that would serve our audiences better.
  An exhibition is a complex undertaking. Just mounting a single artefact is an intricate process that involves many painstaking hours. The microenvironment has to be just right for the artefacts to â€˜live'. I often look at a showcase and wonder to myself, â€˜Are the artefacts snug and comfortable in their new homes?' And when I see a visitor admiring the artefact, I beam with pride. It's an indescribable feeling!

Among the displays in Singapore's museums lie artefacts that speak quietly of the depth of the nation's archaeological heritage. These objects tell the story of Singapore's early history, which goes as far back as the 13th century when it was a port engaged in regional and international trade. While Fort Canning and other terrestrial, or land, sites frequently feature in discussions of Singapore's archaeological heritage, there has been little representation of its maritime archaeological discoveries.
The seas around Southeast Asia have in fact been the site of several historically significant shipwreck discoveries since the 1970s. These date from as recent as the Second World War to the precolonial period, such as the Tang Shipwreck that sank in the 9th centuryâ€”and was found in 1998 in the waters off Belitung Island in the Java Sea, some 600 kilometres southeast of Singapore. A selection of artefacts from the Tang Shipwreck Collection are currently on display at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM). 
Closer to home, the waters around the island have in recent years yielded precious maritime archaeological material. Two outstanding historical shipwrecks discovered within Singapore's waters are the mid-14th-century Temasek Wreck1 in 2015, followed by the 1796 Shah Muncher in 2019. 
The excavation of Yuan-era blue-and-white porcelain from the Temasek Wreck is remarkable for being the largest haul of such porcelain in any shipwreck worldwide.
Underwater surveys and excavations of these shipwrecks conducted between 2016 and 2021 yielded approximately 10 tonnes of artefacts: four tonnes from the Temasek Wreck, and six tonnes from the Shah Muncher. The excavated materials range from Yuan-dynasty (1279â€“1368) porcelain and numerous ceramic cups, bowls and jars, to metal betel nut cutters and accessories.
One of the most extraordinary discoveries was the variety and quantity of Yuan blue-and-white porcelain found in the Temasek Wreck. Eminent archaeologist John Miksic wrote about the rarity of this find among shipwrecks in his 2013 publication:2
Blue and white porcelain was first produced in large quantities in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, in the early fourteenth century. It was considered vulgar at that time, and only became popular among the Chinese elite in the early fifteenth century.
No shipments of blue and white ware have yet been discovered on Yuan shipwrecks. This presents something of a mystery but suggests that not much blue and white ware was being produced.

The findings from these shipwrecks have upturned long-held notions and yielded new perspectives of Singapore's material culture. Similar artefacts, including Longquan greenware dishes, have been found in both the Temasek Wreck and in terrestrial archaeological sites such as Fort Canning and Empress Place along the Singapore River, with material dating to the 14th century. A comparative study of these discoveries from both land and sea contributes to a deeper understanding of Singapore's maritime connections in the precolonial period.
Supported by the National Heritage Board (NHB), ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and ACM, work has been going on behind the scenes to clean, document and study the artefacts in detail. Volunteers led by principal investigator Dr Michael Flecker have slowly chipped away at the large assemblage of artefacts to understand the two shipwrecks and their place in Singapore's history.
Processing Artefacts
After being submerged for centuries, the artefacts retrieved from the two shipwrecks have naturally seen better days. Eroded, coral-encrusted and broken into pieces, the ocean's elements had not been kind to the remains of the shipwreck. The salvaged artefacts had to undergo intensive conservation treatments in order to neutralise the damage they suffered.
First, the artefacts were treated to stabilise them outside the saline marine environment they were submerged in for centuries, before being washed lightly to clean off any surface residue. The latter was especially rewarding for the team as the process revealed the delicate decorative motifs and glazes of the artefactsâ€”the sense of discovery was thrilling.
After this, a dedicated team of volunteers sorted and documented the artefacts into different categories. For the Temasek Wreck, in particular, this detailed sorting process went beyond the broad typologies of greenware, whiteware, stoneware and blue-and-white to determine the variety of the artefacts. Ceramics were carefully examined and then sorted based on their specific glazes, the quality of the clay, their shape and design, and the kilns they might be associated with.

Besides the unprecedentedly large presence of Yuan-dynasty blue-and-white porcelain, there were also numerous Longquan greenwares, white Qingbai bowls and dishes, small-mouth jars and coarse stoneware, among other finds.
Under the team's scrutiny, specific artefacts of interest were observed among the fragmentary remains. These include clues hinting at the interconnections of Southeast Asia's maritime activity as well as a variety of ornate decorative motifs: a friendly-looking dragon moulded in the centre of a dish, a ceramic sherd with a Chinese stamp and another with an Arabic stamp featuring decorative flowers on the rim. Some vessels also had abstract waves and motifs carved onto the ceramic surface, among many other finds. These pieces provide a mere glimpse into the rich variety of the ship's cargo. 
The team collects basic data such as the quantity and weight of the artefacts before photographing and packing them for longer-term storage. This data, along with visual documentation and detailed observations of the artefacts, are then consolidated into databases, providing an overview of the shipwreck assemblage for researchers and museum practitioners. This documentation work is ongoing.

Maritime Archaeology as a Platform for Engagement
There has been much discussion of Singapore's role in historical Southeast Asian maritime networks. However, as this study is often centred on textual historical sources, the wealth of insights that could be drawn from maritime archaeological material remains mostly untapped.
Increasingly, though, maritime archaeological findings have found their way into museums, such as the Tang Shipwreck display at ACM. More recently, selected highlights from the Temasek Wreck and the Shah Muncher have been put on display in ACM's Singapore Archaeology Gallery. 
One of the focus areas of NHB's Our SG Heritage Plan 2.0 is the conservation of Singapore's maritime heritage. As part of this plan, there will be greater funding and support for the research and safeguarding of maritime archaeological material. The latter often requires unique interventions to stabilise and store the artefacts following their extraction from marine environments. 
Needless to say, maritime archaeology is a massive undertaking, an effort only made possible with help rendered by passionate volunteers. In both the Temasek Wreck and the Shah Muncher shipwreck excavations, volunteers helped catalogue the excavated artefacts, contributing significantly to the recording of Singapore's maritime heritage and material culture. These volunteers, who are members of the Southeast Asian Ceramic Society and Friends of the Museum, all share a common interest in documenting Singapore's cultural heritage.

Most people would only ever encounter these artefacts from a distance, through the barrier of a display case in a museum gallery. Being able to directly handle artefacts, many of them centuries-old, is a rare privilege. Holding these archaeological ceramics in one's hands allows for more intimate observations: the indentation of fingerprints from potters centuries ago, the asymmetry of mistakes introduced when crafting each piece, and the imperfectly executed stamps on the surface of a ceramic piece. Through these â€˜flaws', we glean traces of the human touch that have led to the creation of these waresâ€”bridging a connection to those in the past, if you will.

Maritime Artefacts at the Asian Civilisations Museum
As a first step towards making the precious discoveries from the Temasek Wreck and the Shah Muncher accessible to the public, ACM unveiled a selection of artefacts from these shipwrecks in its Singapore Archaeology Gallery in January 2022. 
In conjunction with this new display, one of the showcases in the main Maritime Trade Gallery is dedicated to ceramics from the cargoes of six other shipwrecks. These are the Hatcher Cargo, and wrecks of the Vung Tau, the GÃ¶theborg, the Geldermalsen, the Diana and the Tek Sing. The Diana was, like the Shah Muncher, a country ship that was wrecked in 1817. Both the Diana and the Geldermalsen carried blue-and-white porcelain of a very similar design to those found in the Shah Muncher, reflecting European tastes in tableware at the time.

The final shipwreck in ACM's collection, the 9th-century Tang Shipwreck, resides in a permanent space, the Khoo Teck Puat Gallery. Originally bound for Iran and Iraq, the Arab dhow met its unfortunate end near the island of Belitung, off the coast of Sumatra in Indonesia. It had been loaded with precious cargo from China, such as gold and silver as well as ceramics from the Xing, Ding, Yue, Changsha and Guangdong kilns. 
The layout of ACM's galleries has been designed such that visitors can see how the Temasek Wreck and the Shah Muncher fit into the larger story of maritime trade and international commerce in Asia. The Maritime Trade galleries on the first floor, which include the Singapore Archaeology Gallery and the Tang Shipwreck Gallery, reveal the history of Asian port cities and globalisation through displays of Asian export art.

Highlights from the Temasek Wreck
The most outstanding artefact in the Temasek Wreck display is likely the only intact blue-and-white vessel that was salvaged. The shape of this vessel is unique among Yuan blue-and-white porcelains. The flange around a tall neck suggests it might have been used as a hookah (water pipe) base. The darker spots of inky blueblack cobalt pigment in certain areas of the decoration, known as the â€˜heaped and piled' style, date it to the 14th century.
The only intact Yuan dynasty blue-and-white vessel found in the Temasek Wreck. The image above shows it lying on the ocean floor, encrusted with sediment and coral.
When the vessel was first uncovered by ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute archaeologist Michael Ng, it looked like a discarded objectâ€”such was its state, its delicate design obscured by encrustations of sediment and coral. A small screen next to the vessel in the gallery plays a video capturing the moment of discovery and its subsequent careful retrieval from the ocean bed. Blue-and-white porcelain, like this one, made in the Jingdezhen kilns in Jiangxi Province, may be considered as the first global â€˜brand' of luxury goods that were exported from its production base. These wares were in high demand across Asia and the Middle Eastâ€”and, it seems, in Singapore as well. 
Also on display in the gallery are exquisite fragments excavated from the shipwreck site. These span a large variety of ceramic forms: bowls, stem cups, jars and other types of vessels. It is believed that the port of call of the sunken ship was Temasek (as Singapore was known then). One piece of evidence that points to this is the iconography of a mandarin duck in a lotus pondâ€” the signature motif of Yuan dynasty's Wenzong Emperor (r. 1328â€“32)â€”in blue-and-white porcelains excavated from both the Temasek Wreck and from Temasek-period land sites in Singapore.
Besides blue-and-white porcelain, the Temasek Wreck also yielded large quantities of Longquan ceramics, many of them intact. Famed for their thick, wax-like green glazes ranging from seafoam and jade-green hues to shades of olive, Longquan ceramics were exported in large quantities all over Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and the Islamic world from the 10th to mid-15th centuries. One fine example on display is a barbed-rim dish incised with a rare design of twin phoenixes in the centre. 
Another noteworthy artefact in the gallery is an inkstone, one of the few non-ceramic items recovered from the Temasek Wreck. Inkstones were used for grinding solid inksticks with water to make liquid ink. The lack of ornamentation and the rough chisel marks on the underside suggest that this inkstone served a purely utilitarian purpose.
Highlights from the Shah Muncher Wreck
The second shipwreck, the Shah Muncher, was identified as a country shipâ€”a category of merchant vessels built in India to ply the Chinaâ€“India trade, operating under licence from the East India Company. This deduction was based on parts of the Shah Muncher's hull structure as well as the surviving ship's gear, such as its rigging, anchors and iron cannons.

The Shah Muncher traded Indian cotton for sugar, zinc and porcelain from China. It was built in 1789 for Sorabjee Muncherjee (1755â€“1805), a prominent Parsi merchant in the Bombay export trade. Although the vessel sank in 1796â€” some 23 years before Raffles established a British trading post in Singaporeâ€”its cargo gives us an idea of the kind of goods that might have been purchased and subsequently transshipped in the region. 
Aside from a large ceramic cargo, archaeologists found tutenague (zinc ingots), glass case bottles (designed for easy packing into wooden cases or crates), glass wine bottles, copper alloy bracelets as well as thousands of agate medallions and glass beads. The gallery exhibits a representative selection of this broad range of cargo.
The Shah Muncher also yielded other fascinating objects that provide insights into some of the people who were on board the shipâ€”for instance, Armenian merchants. Their presence on the final voyage of the Shah Muncher is suggested by the personal effects found, such as three mother-of-pearl seals and a small gold tag, all inscribed with Armenian script. Armenian merchants, who had established extensive trading networks in Asia and Europe since the 17th century, both competed and cooperated with British East India Company agents in the pursuit of profit.
A mother-of-pearl seal inscribed with Armenian script recovered from the Shah Muncher shipwreck, attesting to the presence of Armenian merchants on board the ship.
To enhance the visitor experience, the gallery features an immersive video depicting the experience of maritime archaeologists in the course of their work. Viewers get a chance to see them dive among fish, coral and churning sand to salvage precious artefacts in the challenging yet beautifully surreal environment. 
The video is accompanied by a soundscape composed of recordings made during the excavation. Titled â€˜Senescence', which means biological ageing, the aural work interprets a shipwreck as one large, dying organismâ€”suggesting that even as the ship loses its function as a vessel to move humans across the seas, it becomes a harbour for new life. 
The artefactual representation of the historical individual via archaeological assemblages humanises the past. Maritime archaeological sites are akin to time capsules: beyond the excavated cargo, the ship's crew are also represented by their possessions at the time of wrecking. 
The imaginative appeal of maritime archaeology can in a sense embody larger-than-life historical narratives, making it an invaluable resource for heritage outreach and education. With the spotlight increasingly trained on Singapore's rich maritime heritage, the public can expect to see more of its sunken treasures being showcased, even as the story of Singapore's early history continues to unfold with ongoing archaeological projects in the waters around Singapore and Southeast Asia.

Currently on display in the Singapore Archaeology Gallery,this large green-glazed ceramic plate was made in the Longquan kiln in Zhejiang Province. It was one of the significant archaeological finds from the Singapore Riversite at Empress Place, near the Asian Civilisations Museum. Teams from the National University of Singapore and ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute had carried out excavations on thebanks of the Singapore River in 1998 and 2015 respectively.
Featured alongside other finds from the 2015 excavation,the plate is strategically sited right in front of a windowoverlooking the original riverside excavation site, whichis now lined with a row of shady rain trees. Artefacts fromthe Temasek Wreck are placed next to those from Empress Place and Fort Canning to encourage visitors to see the connections between Temasek-era archaeological sites that span land and sea.
Excavations along the Singapore River, including EmpressPlace, yielded various Chinese ceramicsâ€”celadons, blue-and-white wares and white vessels from Dehuaâ€”amongstother finds. These would have been traded for products suchas wood and cotton from the Malay Peninsula and the Riau Islands. The abundance of these goods is evidence of thelively commercial centre that was 14th-century Temasek.

Singapore's very own Silicon Valley: From repurposing pig hearts for human needs to harnessing the humble mushroom to help stop cancer in its tracks, the revolutionary Singapore Science Park was the site of numerous firsts as the city-state explored a new frontier in science and technology in the 1980s.

In the dark of the night, special packages containing pig hearts steeped in brine used to be delivered to the Singapore Science Park. Workers in white overalls had the delicate task of unboxing them and extracting the aortic roots of the organs the next morning.
The roots formed the raw material for which Pacific Biomedical Enterprises produced artificial heart valves to replace malfunctioning human ones1. The company was Singapore's first artificial heart valve maker when it opened at the Singapore Science Park in 19872.

  The pioneering life-saving endeavour, aimed at plugging the shortage of human organ donors, was one of numerous groundbreaking and cutting-edge ventures housed within the park following the complex's soft launch3 in Pasir Panjang in 19824.
Take the case of the humble shiitake mushroom. It was at the Singapore Science Park that National University of Singapore (NUS) biochemist Dr Tan Kok Kheng5 took a stab at extracting lentinan, an anti-cancer substance in the carbohydrate cell walls6 of the fungi. The company went into full production at the park in 19837.
The park was also where the first programmable robots for educational and industrial purposes8 were made as a result of a Singapore-US partnership between local company Intraco and Seattle's Scien-Tech the same year.
Envisioned as the Silicon Valley of Singapore and the epicentre for the nationwide push towards knowledge-based industries, the Singapore Science Park was the city-state's first research & development (R&D) business park where movers and shakers such as scientists, inventors, economists, engineers and marketers converged to push the known limits of their fields.
Along the way, other brand names set up shop at the Science Park.
Seagate Technology, which made hard disc drives, established a facility for development work at the Science Park in 19849. That decade, Singapore earned the distinction of world's leading producer of the device10.
Then, in 1990, the century-old11 Japanese Shimadzu Corporation cemented its supply lines for high-tech medical equipment like gamma cameras, X-ray C T scanners, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems to hospitals in the region. This followed the opening of its R&D and marketing base at the park12.
In 1996, the park hosted the Cray T94, one of the world's most advanced supercomputers, providing Singapore ""access to state-of-the-art technology in high performance computing"".13

  Today, the Singapore Science Park is a thriving technology and development hub home to 12,000 people across 350 laboratories, multinational corporations, and global leading technology companies and R&D institutions such as the Institute of Microelectronics, Johnson & Johnson and Shopee. How did it all begin?

Rebooting the Economy: Conception & Inception of the Singapore Science Park
Following the decline of entrepot trade in the 1950s, Singapore chugged forward in pursuit of a new industrial reality.14 In the decades that followed, flatted factories and assembly lines, where appliances like Setron television sets and Rollei cameras were rolled out, characterised much of the production landscape.15 Processing plants, where textiles and pollutive wood chips were produced, also emerged.
By the late 1970s, it was time to shift gears. The goal? Transition from producing things to ideas.16
With rising educational and living standards, and the economy bursting at maximum employment 17, Singapore began exploring higher valued capital and skill-intensive activities.
After attaining the green light to consolidate national R&D efforts, the Science Council â€” formed in 1967 to advocate for national advancement in science and technology â€” mapped out plans for a revolutionary science park. The Economic Development Board (EDB) and Jurong Town Council (JTC) were charged with its development.18
First, there was the matter of site selection. JTC chairman Tang I-Fang, an engineer and economist by training19, settled on land near the National University of Singapore and National University Hospital with the intention of fostering rapport between academia, medicine and industry for real world solutions.20
Next, a whirlwind trip around the world was planned to glean insights from the best of the best. A team, which included JTC's Swee Kee Siong, set forth to explore the United Kingdom's Cambridge Science Park, America's Silicon Valley and Stanford Research Park, Taiwan's Hsinchu Science Park, and Korea's Daedeok Science City.21
Mr Swee recalled: â€œTo be frank, we knew very little about science parks. Our forte was in industrial land, and this was so different for us. Once we returned (from the trip), we immediately started to incorporate the learnings into the master planning for Singapore's first science park.
â€œEven though none of us at the time were researchers or scientists, we could still contribute to the R&D ecosystem of Singaporeâ€¦ We wanted to develop the Singapore Science Park as the place for the country's R&D drive and initiatives to take root and flourish.â€
Textures of the Park
In contrast to the no-frills factories and industrial compounds of yesteryear, the Singapore Science Park drew inspiration from the lush, sprawling and impressive campus designs of the world's top universities.
An unfenced and porous terrain in a sylvan setting where â€œbuildings harmonised with nature to inspire workers to achieve better resultsâ€, was the result.22
In an interview, JTC's Seetoh-Yam Kum Chun, tasked with planning the park, noted that the complex even had a pocket park with fauna and water features. She added: â€œThis was also the first time that we had ever conserved trees. Together with a United Nations representative, we had to study the wooded environment to save as many trees as we could and to preserve the natural terrain, where possible.â€23
Building works kicked into high gear in 1981. Blocks bore the last names of legendary scientists and inventors such as Blaise Pascal, Gregor Mendel and Alexander Fleming.
While this was under way, an admissions committee comprising representatives from NUS, JTC, EDB, the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (Sisir), and the Applied Science Corporation and Defence Science Organisation, sought tenants whose work would help the nation achieve its R&D ambitions.24
In 1984, the Singapore Science Park officially opened to fanfare. The event was graced by royalty â€” Norway's Crown Prince Harald â€” and officiated by Singapore's Minister of Law EW Barker. In true 80s' fashion, bubbly was popped with celebratory champagne gushing down a pyramid of glasses to celebrate the park's official beginnings.
The event also marked the opening of the $10 million centre of its first tenant â€” the Det Norske Veritas Marine Technology Centre â€” one of the world's largest companies in ship classification and certifications.25

    A Convergence of International Minds
The $500 million Science Park drew 34 R&D organisations between the years 1983 and 19872627. Many were involved in important work, with some racing against time to meet urgent healthcare needs. For instance, as HIV/Aids raged worldwide, killing thousands including its first victim in Singapore in 198728, researchers at the park worked tirelessly to produce virus proteins for diagnostic testing.29
Research was also being conducted to better understand the Epstein Barr virus, known to cause nose and throat cancers among Asians in particular.30
Attracted by multiple factors such as healthy growth prospects, grants, tax incentives, and competitive rental and lease rates, companies like Fujitsu31, Pfizer32, Shell33, Silicon Valley-based ASK Computer Systems34, as well as Reuters Holdings which set up a $40 million R&D centre35, started operations at the park.
Singapore was fast becoming an intellectual entrepot centre. The park was also home to local agencies such as Singapore's National Computer Board.36
In a speech marking Technology Month in September 1989, Mr Mah Bow Tan, Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Communications and Information, described the park as home to â€œa thriving dynamic little communityâ€ of more than 2,000 workers, many of whom were R&D workers.37
By then, 50 organisations engaged in a broad spectrum of technologies including biotechnology, computer and information technology, microelectronics, marine technology, and chemical engineering had moved in. Many had built state-of-the-art laboratories.
Mr Tan, noting that the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation was â€œalive and kickingâ€, also highlighted noteworthy industry-academic collaborations including a joint project between Singapore Biotech and NUS' department of pathology to produce a rapid immunologic diagnostic kit for thalassaemia screening.
In 1993, Singapore took another leap towards becoming a technology city with the launch of the $291 million 20ha Singapore Science Park 2 along roads in Buona Vista and Pasir Panjang.38 Its first tenant was the Institute of Microelectronics.39

  Interaction, cooperation, and joint projects between university staff and tenants in the Science Park, considered critical elements in contributing to the park's success, continued to be emphasised. To encourage mingling, lifestyle amenities, a clubhouse, and even restaurants including a place called Spot in the Hub, opened on its grounds.41 Diners recount cosy dinners lit by oil lamps in laboratory jars and fusion dishes which ignited the senses.
A number of formal initiatives were also launched to foster such connections:
In 1986, Sisir announced the establishment of a R&D Incubator Centre42 to nurture up-and-coming local firms.43
In 1993, The Innovators Club, a fraternity for R&D professionals to meet and exchange ideas, opened.44
In 1996, an $11 million Innovation Centre, a one-stop high-tech facility for budding entrepreneurs and companies, was unveiled. It offered amenities like meeting rooms and services such as secretarial support.45
With the benefit of being ahead of the curve, Singapore became a model for other science parks. Its concept was exported to cities like Bangalore in the 1990s46, and inspired many-a-visiting dignitary and industry leader.
Makeovers and a New Phase of Growth
Rivalling international R&D facilities, new buildings rose at the park as part of a comprehensive $400 million makeover beginning in the late 2000s. This largely impacted Science Park 1.
The 2000s also heralded the arrival of Lilly, the first drugs company to set up an R&D centre in Singapore47, tissue banking firm CordLife, and food company Danisco which produces ingredients for ice-cream makers across the globe.48
Singapore has since made significant strides towards becoming a R&D powerhouse with other complexes such as one-north springing up in the wake of the park's success.49
The Future is Bright
Alongside the likes of Zurich, Oslo and London, Singapore was ranked the 7th smartest city in the world in the 2023 global Smart City Index.
Exciting experiments, thoughtful inventions and practical innovations at the Singapore Science Park contribute to this ranking. A leading hub for R&D in Southeast Asia, the park serves as a testbed for numerous developments in Artificial Intelligence, future mobility, agri-tech, and robotics.
Championing this, CapitaLand launched the Smart Urban Co-Innovation Lab at the Singapore Science Park in 2020 to power innovations in areas like urban farming and energy management. It is the region's first industry-led laboratory designed to produce and fund solutions for smart cities.50

Fresh Vision for a Brighter Tomorrow. Anticipating the future needs of Singapore's modern knowledge-based economy, Singapore Science Park I has embarked on a multi-stage rejuvenation, starting with the first precinct - Geneo. As a world-class hub for life sciences and innovation, Geneo welcomes sectors such as healthcare, deep tech and digital transformation. With innovation, community and sustainability at its heartbeat, Geneo offers a re-imagined holistic lifestyle for change-makers by placing their needs at the forefront of its design.
In keeping pace with the thriving R&D landscape and to mark the park's 40th anniversary, Geneo, a new life sciences and innovation cluster is rising progressively within the complex. Slated for completion in 2025, it comprises five new sustainable buildings. Following Geneo's completion, the park's population is expected to increase by approximately 75 per cent from 12,000 to 21,000.
The Singapore Science Park in its new chapter, has been envisioned as a welcoming destination for the broader community. Members of the public can look forward to retail options and other amenities such as an all-weather event plaza with a dramatic louvred glass canopy for large-scale community events, alongside an interconnected basement for seamless connectivity to Kent Ridge MRT station.
Placemaking programmes, such as Art Jam Science Park, Flavours of Tomorrow, and Innovation Made Real have been rolled out for the community as testament to the park's values of collaboration, creativity, inclusivity and innovation.

About the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme
The Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme is a collaborative effort between NHB and local shop owners to strengthen partnerships with communities and raise awareness of and foster deeper appreciation for heritage in everyday spaces.

The scheme allows NHB to work closely with local shop owners with at least 30 years of history in selected precincts to co-create ""mini-museums"" that showcase the history and heritage of their respective businesses and trades. Located on site, these galleries will display historical documents, photographs, and artefacts that tell the stories of these shops.

On top of providing funding, curatorial support and assistance in fabricating the showcases, NHB will also work with local shop owners to develop programmes such as talks, tours, and workshops, and provide opportunities to participate in key NHB events.

Three Generations in the Making: Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Popiah

One of Singapore's oldest popiah and kueh pie tee makers, Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Popiah was founded at 95 Joo Chiat Road in 1938 by Quek Tren Wen, an immigrant from Anxi, China. Popiah consists of finely-chopped vegetables and meat encased in a thin flour skin, while kueh pie tee is made of the same filling stuffed into pie-crust shells.

Rising at dawn, Quek would commence the arduous task of kneading the day's dough by hand. The excess dough was repurposed to make kueh pie tee shells in the early days, a suggestion from his Peranakan wife, Tan Ah Poh. Initially, Peranakan families made up Quek's primary clientele, but word quickly spread, leading to a surge in orders from Joo Chiat residents as well as from all over Singapore. 

All of their 16 children helped in the shop, with the boys trained in making the skins, while the girls, guided by Tan, learned to prepare savoury sweet popiah fillings. In the 1990s, Ker Cheng Lye, the eldest son, responded to growing demand by offering popiah fillings and sauces for sale, recognising that many customers struggled to replicate the shop's homemade flavours. 

Today, led by third-generation steward Michael, Kway Guan Huat is dedicated to preserving their cherished family tradition while also proto-typing new products such as pandan-flavoured popiah skins. Though online sales now rival walk-in customers, Kway Guan Huat remains committed to offering fresh popiah using the same time-honoured techniques pioneered by their late founder.
This grater was used to shred bangkwang (Chinese turnip) by hand into fine strips to be used as popiah filling.
From Roadside Stall to Peranakan Classic: Kim Choo Kueh Chang


Kim Choo Kueh Chang, a one-stop shop for all things Peranakan, has its roots in a makeshift stall marked by a banyan tree at the intersection of Joo Chiat Place and Everitt Road, which Lee Kim Choo founded in 1945. Unlike most nyonya (Peranakan women) then, Lee opened a stall to provide for her family, using culinary skills taught by her grandmother, Tok Siew Neo. Lee's food and kindness quickly endeared her to the Joo Chiat community and attracted customers from across Singapore.
  It was, however, the resounding praise for her signature kueh chang (Peranakan rice dumplings) with its generous filling that prompted Lee to focus on perfecting this iconic delicacy. In the 1970s, she moved to a shophouse at 60 Joo Chiat Place, where her handcrafted dumplings continue to be sold today.
  In 1997, Lee's daughter-in-law Helen Lim introduced bite-sized dumplings, which became popular despite Lee's initial scepticism. Having earned the matriarch's confidence, Lim, with her husband Wong Sin Min, took over the shop. She introduced other innovations like chicken and vegetarian dumplings filled with mock meat that helped the business overcome the swine and bird flu crises, as well as other kueh made using Tok's recipes. As business boomed, Lim set up a shop at East Coast Road in 2003.
  Today, the business is run by Lee's grandchildren, who have expanded the shop to showcase Peranakan cuisine and culture by establishing a boutique for bespoke Peranakan wear and a mini gallery, all the while upholding their grandmother's legacy of community spirit and commitment to quality.
This pair of kasut manek (beaded shoes) belonged to Lee Kim Choo, who had commissioned them from a sworn sister to help her financially. Today, the family passes on these skills through public workshops on Peranakan beading.
Satisfaction to the Last Strand: Joo Chiat Fei Fei Wanton Noodle House


Known for its handmade springy egg noodles served with fresh pork dumplings, homemade charsiew (Cantonese-style roasted pork) and special chilli sauce, Joo Chiat Fei Fei Wanton Noodle House's story began more than 70 years ago with founder Chan Sin Yam and his humble pushcarts.
Chan, who came to Singapore aged 17 from Guangzhou, China in 1922, first honed his skills at a Jalan Besar noodle factory before relocating to Joo Chiat to sell noodles to hawkers. After the war, Chan turned to hawking, and he would ply Joo Chiat's streets with his sons daily. Leading the way on bicycle was his grandson, Lim Loon Huat, who would announce their arrival and take customers' orders.
In the 1970s, Chan rented a coffeeshop at 72 Joo Chiat Place, which he affectionately named Fei Fei (â€œfatâ€ in Cantonese) after his two chubby grandsons. Following Chan's passing in 2000, Lim, who had been working at Fei Fei since the age of 20, took the helm as its current third-generation owner. He decided to keep the business open round-the-clock to cater to the late-night crowd in Joo Chiat.
Over the years, Lim introduced new dishes such as their chicken cutlet noodles and yong tau foo (stuffed beancurd), and relocated to 45 Joo Chiat Place in 2023 to offer a more pleasant dining experience. Nevertheless, Fei Fei remains dedicated to making and serving noodles of the same high quality as Chan's, thereby ensuring that his culinary legacy lives on in every bowl served.
This porcelain pot was previously used to hold chopped green chillies, which customers could add to make their noodles as spicy as desired.
Celebration of Peranakan Culinary Tradition: Guan Hoe Soon Restaurant


Established in 1953 by Yap Chee Quee, Guan Hoe Soon Restaurant stands as one of Singapore's oldest Peranakan eateries, where generations of families have enjoyed its signature Hokkien-Peranakan delicacies such as ayam buah keluak (chicken with keluak nuts) and hee pioh (fish maw soup).
  Yap arrived in Singapore from Hainan in 1918. Though not of Peranakan heritage, he honed his culinary skills while working as a housekeeper for various Peranakan families, one of which was the Chew Joo Chiat household. Later, he opened his own coffee shop at 185 Joo Chiat Road. Word of his cooking reached other Peranakan families and they subsequently invited him and his son Kow Soon to prepare lavish Tok Panjang feasts (a long table of dishes) in their homes.
  With their growing clientele, Yap opened a bigger restaurant at 214 Joo Chiat Road in 1953 to cater for occasions ranging from wedding banquets to funerals, and named the restaurant Guan Hoe Soon after his three sons. After his father's passing, Kow Soon's own passion for food prompted him to assume the reins of the reputable establishment, which drew notable patrons such as the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
  The restaurant, now helmed by Kow Soon's daughter, Jenny, relocated to 38/40 Joo Chiat Place in 2009 and later to 200 Joo Chiat Road in 2022. Having introduced her own creations like kueh salat (pandan-flavoured custard on glutinous rice), Jenny continues to lead Guan Hoe Soon in preparing authentic Peranakan cuisine from scratch and preserving the traditional taste of the food that its customers have come to know and love.
This cutlery set bearing the restaurant's name and old five-digit telephone number from 214 Joo Chiat Road was used during events such as weddings and birthday celebrations.
Hot Till the Last Drop: Sin Heng Claypot Bak Koot Teh

Established in 1981, this family-owned eatery traces its beginnings to two bak kut teh (pork ribs in a peppery or herbal broth) stalls named Sin Heng Bak Koot Teh (â€œNew Fortuneâ€ in Hokkien), which sisters Tey Chui Hua and Tey Siew Hua founded at two Bedok coffee shops. The sisters were seamstresses turned avid cooks who shared the dream of making a living from their culinary skills.
  In 1983, an opportunity arose to open their own restaurant at 439 Joo Chiat Road with their elder sister Sue Hua, as well as her and Siew Hua's respective husbands Andy Soo and Lim See Kuang. To differentiate themselves from other bak kut teh shops, Sin Heng introduced claypots to maintain the broth's sizzling heat till the very last drop â€“ this eventually became their signature dish.
  The year 1999 brought another challenge with the Nipah virus outbreak, during which the public shied away from consuming pork, forcing Sin Heng to close for two months. Undeterred, the Teys diversified their menu, introducing new dishes such as sweet-and-sour fish and Thai-style chicken to cater to diverse palates. Today, Sin Heng continues to serve a plethora of popular zi char (cooked to order) dishes that complement their bak kut teh offerings.
  Now run by the family's second generation, Sin Heng stands tall as a cherished culinary spot in Joo Chiat, where families celebrate milestones and patrons return to savour tender ribs in a fragrant broth that has maintained its quality through the years.
This claypot, one of the original pots used by Sin Heng in its early years, allowed diners to enjoy their bak kut teh at their own pace, thanks to its exceptional heat retention.
Fresh Take on Traditional Treats: D'Bun


Founded in 1991 by Lee Mimi, D'Bun is known for its multitude of delightful confections that are especially sought after during festive periods. Motivated by a love of good food, Lee first opened a stall selling traditional snacks in the basement of Parkway Parade.
  Inspired by popular cafe names beginning with â€œDâ€ at the time such as â€œDelifranceâ€, Lee chose the contemporary moniker â€œD'Bunâ€ for her stall. She initially focused on mini-sized buns including their signature charsiew bao (roasted pork buns) and da bao (sliced pork buns). The overwhelming reception to these products saw D'Bun's expansion into a full-fledged bakery at 358 Joo Chiat Road later that year. While D'Bun initially relied on a professional baker, Lee's dedication led her to fine-tune recipes and introduce creations like intricately hand-cut, lotus-shaped lian hua tao (longevity buns).
  The Nipah virus outbreak in 1999 had a significant impact on sales, as public apprehension led to a decline in pork bun consumption. This prompted Lee to diversify D'Bun's offerings and to introduce festive treats with a twist, such as durian-filled koi-shaped confections and Chinese zodiac animal buns. This endeavour also paved the way for the introduction of seasonal mooncakes and rice dumplings made fresh daily.
  Today, D'Bun has established an annual tradition of unveiling novel creations based on traditional treats, such as pistachio and cheesecake mooncakes. Together with her daughter Serena, Lee continues to innovate with handmade delicacies that infuse modern flavours and add a fresh twist to local culinary traditions.
These wooden moulds were used to shape mooncakes and other confections including (clockwise, from left) traditional baked mooncakes, Lunar New Year fish-shaped confections, and modern snow skin mooncakes.

A teacher gains access to the Chinese Clock Tower, a National Monument, climbing its narrow iron staircase and marveling at the breathtaking view from the top. Through a unique collaboration, a digital 3D scan and virtual reality experience of the Clock Tower are created, granting staff and students an opportunity to explore its interior.
Text by Ms Clara Khoo, Hwa Chong Institution
Not many can say that they work at a place which has a building that is gazetted as a national monument - I am one of the lucky few as a teacher in Hwa Chong Institution (HCI).
As a history buff and heritage lover, I am always in awe whenever I drive up the slope and see the Clock Tower Building at the start of the day.
While staff and students can see and walk past the historical landmark on a daily basis, being able to step inside is another thing altogether. The top of the Clock Tower is kept under lock and key, so imagine my excitement when I was able to access it as part of my MOE Teacher Work Attachment (TWA) with The National Heritage Board (NHB).
With the help of the school's Dean (Special Projects), Mr Tan Pheng Tiong and the school's Estate personnel, we were given a tour of the Clock Tower through a staircase atop the building's roof.
Once inside the Clock Tower, we saw an iron staircase very similar to the one inside the National Museum of Singapore and it was very narrow indeed! After climbing up what felt like a very long few minutes and getting slightly dizzy, we reached a mezzanine level with four smaller doors that each opened up to a smaller balcony and one of the four clock faces.
At the top of the Clock Tower, the view of Bukit Timah and its surroundings was simply breathtaking! Some of us were trying to identify the buildings in the distance - you could see all the way to the city center while the others were wondering whether the iron staircase was the original one from the 1920s. I was just trying to take it all in that we had just scaled up a pre-war artefact which had so much history to tell.
  Towards the end of the site recce, one of the estate personnel asked, â€œwhy are they so interested in the Clock Tower? â€¦ It seems like many people like to look to the past.â€
I chuckled to myself and thought, â€œI'm one of themâ€ before replying that our school is probably the only one with a Clock Tower Building that has been gazetted as a national monument - especially in view of the rich history that the Clock Tower bore witness to.
Completed in 1925, the Clock Tower Building is one of the few surviving Swan & Maclaren buildings from that period that reflected a move towards modernism in Singapore's architectural history. During World War II, the Clock Tower Building with its height and vantage point by both the Japanese and British troops as a surveillance point. In the post-war period, the Clock Tower Building also witnessed the tumultuous period of the 1950s and 60s when the school campus was rife with student activism.
The final outcome of the collaboration between HCI and NHB was a digital 3D scan and virtual reality imaging of the Clock Tower Building. This provides staff and students with an opportunity to see inside the Clock Tower that would otherwise not be possible - a true win-win for everyone.

Chung May Khuen shares with MUSE SG the impetus for the museum's shift in focus to include the present with the Collecting Contemporary Singapore initiative, the change in her perception of the role of technology in museums, and her hopes for the future of NMS.
MUSE SG January 2023
Read the full MUSE SG Jan 2023 Issue
Presently director of the National Museum of Singapore (NMS), Chung May Khuen began her career as an assistant curator at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 1997 before joining NMS as a curator in 2003. After a stint at the Heritage Conservation Centre, she rejoined NMS in 2019. Among the exhibitions she has curated are In the Mood for Cheongsam: Modernity and Singapore Women (2012) and The Wedding Dress: 200 Years of Wedding Fashion from the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (2012). 
Hi, May Khuen! Please tell us what led you to join the National Museum of Singapore.
I studied history at the National University of Singapore. However, I never did a module on Singapore history as I resisted studying a subject I felt was too close to home; you know, how the grass is usually greener on the other side? I was more interested in learning about other peoples' cultures. I joined the Asian Civilisations Museum as an assistant curator in 1994. There, I looked after the South Asia collection and was involved in the exhibition Krishna: The Blue God, as well as international travelling exhibitions such as Eternal Egypt: Treasures from the British Museum. I also curated the permanent South Asia galleries which opened in 2003.
That same year, an opportunity came up to join the Singapore History Museum [predecessor of today's National Museum of Singapore]. I jumped at the chance because I was attracted by the museum's plans to open a new fashion gallery. I've always loved fabrics as they are a key component of material culture. I find fashion to be a very underrated aspect of Singapore culture, even though much can be said about the identity of a people through the lens of what they wear. I am particularly interested in the independence of women expressed through clothing in the 1950s and '60s.
How has the National Museum changed over the years since you joined?
I joined the museum in 2003 when it was undergoing a major shiftâ€”we spent a lot of time thinking about what the museum should be. A survey conducted earlier revealed that a significant number of people in Singapore thought of museums as generally dull and did not enjoy visiting them. In response, Lee Chor Lin, the museum director at the time, charted an entirely new direction: she was convinced that the museum should no longer be a traditional space focusing merely on the historical development of Singapore, but move towards towards themes exploring social history and popular culture. The museum would also become a lifestyle destination for all segments of society.
In the postwar section of the Singapore History Gallery, visitors step into a model kitchen typically found in an early Housing and Development Board flat built in the 1960s.
Thereafter, the museum began delving into more relatable topics like fashion, food, film and photography, with galleries dedicated to these themes set up in the former Singapore History Gallery. In doing so, the museum expanded its reach to different demographics. We wanted people to visit the museum not just for its exhibitions, but also for other activities. In line with this, the museum launched the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que film programmes and a restaurant opened on the premises in 2004.
After Chor Lin, my predecessor Angelita [Teo] took over as director. Angelita was fascinated by tech and how it could be used to enhance the museum experience. At first, I was rather resistant to this idea as my curatorial training taught me to firstly showcase the object. I felt that new technologies would be a distraction. But over time I began to understand how tech could add value to the work of museums. Thus, when the museum underwent another revamp to prepare for Singapore's golden jubilee celebrations in 2015, we employed the use of multimedia to complement the narratives.
Angelita also introduced contemporary art to the museum by partnering cutting-edge artists such as [Japanese digital art collective] teamLab to offer fresh ways of presenting local narratives. Besides that, we also launched Digimuse, an initiative to engage the tech sector to encourage creative experimentation in cultural spaces. Digimuse has since supported a wide range of prototype projects including new experiences in immersive reality and dynamic conversations enabled by artificial intelligence.
What is your take on the role of technology in museums today?
Tech is a fact of modern life, particularly with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has opened new doors and changed the way we present content in our museums. The visitor experience begins online even before one steps into the actual exhibition space. This prelude may even take the form of an online game to pique the visitor's interest first.
The Story of the Forest, an immersive multimedia experience produced by teamLab, is a key attraction at the National Museum's Glass Rotunda. It is also a good example of how the museum has harnessed technology to enhance the visitor's experience.
With technology, we can also solve the issue of showcasing collections that cannot be presented permanently. Take, for instance, the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings: only 40â€“50 illustrations from the collection's over 400 drawings can be displayed at any one time, and only for two years at most due to the fragile condition of the artefacts. What about the rest? To get around the problem, the museum commissioned teamLab to create a multimedia experience based on the collection. Visitors can now enjoy The Story of the Forest , which features almost 70 digitally rendered works from the Farquhar collection, at the museum's Glass Rotunda.
Collecting Contemporary Singapore is a relatively new initiative where the museum's collection has expanded to include contemporary artefacts that reflect our current times. Why did NMS adopt this new collecting strategy?
This strategy is inspired by the â€˜rapid response collecting' concept where museums expand their collections to include artefacts relating to major moments in recent history or are relevant o contemporary events. For us, the COVID-19 pandemic was the most recent catalyst. The last time we faced a similar situation was the SARS outbreak in Singapore that occurred in March 2003, not long after I started work as a curator at NMS. I remember Chor Lin quickly getting into action, working with Singapore Press Holdings to commission photography at Tan Tock Seng Hospitalâ€”the epicentre of the outbreak.
With that experience, I knew we had to act swiftly when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. At the same time, we realised that the initiative must not be just a one-off response but should continue even afterâ€”and so Collecting Contemporary Singapore began.
This represents a broadening of our focus from the past towards the present. For instance, the exhibition, Off/On: Everyday Technology that Changed Our Lives, 1970s â€“2000s , which ended its run in October 2022, continued the principle of featuring a topic that's important to us in daily life. There was also some continuity from Picturing the Pandemic: A Visual Record of Covid-19 in Singapore held in 2021 in terms of our reliance on technology. The latter was the museum's first exhibition based on the Collecting Contemporary Singapore initiative.
A section of the exhibition, Off/On: Everyday Technology that Changed Our Lives, 1970s â€“2000s.
We felt that Off/On was successful in sparking interesting conversations; seeing families of different age groups, even three-generational ones, coming to view the exhibition was really nice. It was a very tactile exhibitionâ€”for example, we recreated the experience of using a pager, now a veritable relic, to send messages, and visitors could touch the typewriters displayed.
How do you perceive the role of the museum today?
I see the museum playing a critical role today as a social space enjoyed by people for what it is; for some, just because they want a place to hang out. But I also see it as a space for people seeking solitude, where they can escape from the stressors of daily life or the harsh reality of the ongoing pandemic. I think the latter is something we can better appreciate today after battling the worst of the pandemic.
Since 2006, the museum has been making concerted efforts to move away from traditional and elitist ideals of what makes a museum, to becoming a more relevant space for the communityâ€”a people's museum where everyone is welcomed, and with no barriers for all strata of society. I know some people in the past didn't dare step into the colonial-era building that houses NMS because they just found it too intimidating.
One of the ways we are making the museum more accessible is through Collecting Contemporary Singapore, which signals that we are interested in the â€˜now', issues that resonate with the people today. We want to be the bridge between the past and the present.
Your background is in fashion. If the National Museum was an outfit, what would it be and why?
Oh, it would be the cheongsam, for sureâ€”a classic! It emerged at the turn of the 20th century, and the modern cheongsam has survived over a hundred years. In the 1950s and â€˜60s when women wanted to express their modern identity, the shape of the cheongsam took on a cosmopolitan flavour with a nipped-in waist for a more figure-hugging silhouette. The cheongsam symbolises resilience and modernityâ€”and it is sexy.
The cheongsam has reflected different identities in different eras, but it always has a role to play. Similarly, this is my wish for the National Museum: to stay relevant for different audiences. Having a progressive mindset and constantly evolving according to the times will ensure that the grande dame will never go out of fashion.
Black cheongsam with embroidered dragon. 1950s-1970s. Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
Cheongsam with gold sequinned dragons such as this one were a popular evening outfit among Singapore women in the late 1950s and 1960s. The dragon signifies strength, power and good luck in Chinese mythology. By the 1950s, the wearing of black cheongsam by women in Singapore had become more widespread due to both modernisation and Westernisation. Black â€”previously considered inappropriate and taboo because of its symbolic associations with death and tragedyâ€”became a staple in women's wardrobes. A black cheongsam was considered extremely versatile as it was suitable for both day and evening functions when matched with the right accessories.

What were the circumstances that shaped our eating habits and taste preferences in the 20th century? We trace the rise in popularity of laksa, ice kachang and Milo in Singapore's food culture.

Although Singapore's known past goes back to the late 1200s, it is arguably the 20th century that stands out as the most significant in the history of its food culture.1 Many, if not most, of Singapore's old cuisines declined or vanished during this period.2
But why have some dishes survived and grown into icons today? And why have others, once obscure, become ubiquitous? There are no definitive answers to these complex questions. Much depends on the nature of the food item in question, and its social and historical context.

The Advent of Artificial Refrigeration
What we eat and cook is deeply influenced by the technologies available to us. Often what comes to mind first is the use of the stove and the application of fire and heat in one form or another. While the shift from wood and charcoal-based fuels to stoves using electricity and natural gas was an important factor driving culinary change in Singapore during the 20th century, it was access to ice, rather than fire, that was probably more critical in shifting the playing field. Artificial refrigeration had an outsized impact on how food in a tropical environment like Singapore was produced, transported, stored and even conceived. In less than a century, refrigeration made it possible for an unprecedented range of food items to be consumed by an increasingly broad swathe of Singapore's population.
Singapore was home to a permanent ice manufacturing presence as early as 1861. Early players included Singapore Ice Works, Pioneer Steam Works and Straits Ice Company. Some wealthy households also had small-scale ice-making machines. Ice was initially used for medicinal purposes, chilling drinks and desserts consumed by the well-to-do, and, most significantly, to preserve fish caught and transported to Singapore from distant waters. Portable and relatively cheap, locally made ice in Singapore was the main form of refrigeration in markets, retail spaces and homes before the 1960s.
As artificial refrigeration became more affordable over time, more households could enjoy fresh seafood like Spanish mackerel (tenggiri). Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons.
By the mid-1930s, Singapore was producing an estimated 300â€“600 tons of ice daily. Much of this ice was channelled into the expanding Singapore-based fishing industry. A 1948 survey of Singapore's ice industry found that roughly half of all ice produced was used to chill freshly caught fish, with the remainder purchased by retailers for food preservation, the chilling of drinks and ice-cream manufacture.3
As in the rest of the region, only subsistence fishermen and the richest strata of society could afford to eat a wide variety of seafood, served as fresh as possible. An 1895 report asserted that only Europeans and wealthier Asians in Singapore could enjoy fresh meat or fish on their tables twice a day, including Spanish mackerel (tenggiri), pomfret (bawal), mullet (jempul) or some other similarly tasty fish found in local markets. In contrast, Singapore's urban working classes were believed to eat two meals a day, mostly comprising boiled rice and a â€œsmall morsel of dried fishâ€.4
It was only after the Second World War, as the proportion of Singapore's salaried middle-class Asian residents grew, that more households could enjoy fresh seafood as well as pork, chicken, beef or mutton. Dried, salted fish correspondingly became less of a low-cost protein staple for the masses and was used more as a condiment.
The growth of the fishing industry and its demand for ice had knock-on effects in other culinary areas. Iced confections were already being sold in Singapore by the 1880s, though primarily for the affluent. By the 1920s, however, the greater affordability and accessibility of ice meant that local desserts such as ice kachang (see page 40) were becoming more widely consumed.
The Rise of Culinary Nationalism
As cuisines began to be perceived as familiar to residents in a given territory, and even eaten by many of them on occasion, the notion that certain dishes were more representative of a common territorial identity began to take hold.6 The development of popular food culture thus added texture to the tentative, messy nature of early nationalism in Singapore.
Perhaps because it was already seen as a staple food consumed by Asians of all economic classes in Singapore by the beginning of the 20th century, laksa became a particularly potent dish for expressing a Malayan-Singaporean identity. At a lecture on how local Straits Asians could maintain and even improve their social status in the 1920s, Lim Boon Keng, a prominent member of the community, highlighted the importance for young Singaporeans to understand the cultural environment they had been raised in:
The next problem you have to think of is the influence of our entire environment, that is, the social life in Singapore. The social life in Singapore is a complete mixture. In Scotland, you say, Scotch broth; in Singapore, the nearest thing is Laksaâ€”everything mixed up. And if you are a student of psychology or sociology or humanity it will take you many years really to study the effects of Malaya, of all the customs, bad habits and good habits.7
Laksa became a staple menu item at pre-independence fundraising events in Singapore, including efforts to provide relief for the unemployed in the 1930s. When Japan went to war with China in 1937, homemade laksa even became a means through which local Chinese upper and middle classes expressed solidarity against Japanese imperialism:
Shocked by harrowing stories of human suffering caused by ruthless bombarding of their countrymenâ€¦ by tales of hungry, crying children robbed of their parents and left to perish, the Chinese women of Singapore have hit on a novel way of raising funds for the upkeep of these destitute war orphans.

The irony of serving a â€˜local' dishlike laksa to support a â€˜Chinese' cause gave way to further social transformations. After the end of the Japanese Occupation in 1945, growing numbers of young Malayans went abroad for their university education; in the process, they inadvertently learned more about what it meant to be â€˜Malayan', not least through food:
Today's [Malayan] students [in London] queue for the bus, share â€˜digs', swot hard for the examinations, buy a cheap seat at the cinema and occasionally cook their own mealsâ€¦A great deal of ingenuity is practised by students in â€˜digs' in cooking their own Malayan food. There is the Chinese student who claims that he has found the best available ingredients for cooking kai cheok (chicken broth)â€” Bachelor's chicken noodle, dehydrated chicken and rice. Laksa is produced by another out of vermicelli, roti babi out of bread, eggs, mackerel and tamarind and minced beef, onions and garlic.9
Long before Singapore's independence in 1965, food fights were already brewing between proponents from either side of the Causeway about which version of Malayan laksa was superior, provoked by remarks made by well-meaning Western outsiders:
America's food expert, Mr. C. A. Rietz, thinks Singapore's food is â€˜wonderful' but up-country folks and even many Singaporeans maintain that the home of good Malayan food is Penangâ€¦Mr Jimmy Tan, an airline clerk: â€˜Although a Singaporean, I have to give the credit to Penang for food. She has Siamese laksa of the sweet and sour type, Chee Yok Chok (pork broth), and delicious Hockien Meeâ€¦ Singapore perhaps can only boast of its Chicken Rice.'10
Urbanisation and Hygiene Challenges
The unfolding of Singaporean nationalism was also tied to basic questions of development and economic growthâ€”in essence, what modernisation in Singapore was largely about during the 20th century. Much of Singapore's old infrastructure did not mesh well with the growth of mass industrialisation andan expanding population, which in turn led to rapid urban development. Urban renewal had a mixed impact on local food culture as a food reviewer recounted:
I remember Hong Chew Kee [stall] from old People's Parkâ€¦ After the famous fire and resettlement, business deterioratedâ€¦ Dish by dish the traditional desserts went. Up to the beginning of this year the sponge cakes were still available, but now no longer because of poor sales.11
Redevelopment was also driven by long-standing public and privately aired concerns about cleanliness, hygiene, and outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis, in a crowded city. By the 1930s, there was a growing stigma in Singapore against everyday behaviour and habits that could spread diseases through bodily fluids and even touch, especially in public. Spitting became increasingly politicised and an area of concern for public health. Such developments helped drive the decline of betel chewing, though it fell out of favour over the space of a generation, rather than within a few years.

Thus in 1949, betel chewing and public spitting were still widely seen as habits that would be impossible to eradicate, as a bus passenger reportedly said:
Why don't you know? The Government has passed a new law forbidding spitting. What are we supposed to do with betel spit? Swallow it. What if a fly got in your mouth? Likewise, swallow it.12
Some 70 years later, among its few surviving Singaporean practitioners, betel chewing had been relegated to the margins of respectability:
The first important thing is that, it's very messy and untidy. Dirty, lah! Dirty and scary, so dirtyâ€¦ I am very careful. I cannot swallow the red thing, but I choose where I spit. I always spit in the dustbin. I cannot throw, the thing is too dirty! [Laughs].13

Anxieties about public order and hygiene since the 1920s also affected many other local foods, some for the better, others for worse. In Singapore, repeated outbreaks of typhoid and cholera, spurred by the sale of uncooked dishes such as iced desserts and ice balls, led to a groundswell of interest in finding ways to â€˜clean up' food businesses. Concerns fuelled attention to the steps being taken elsewhere in urban Southeast Asia to manage the sale of uncooked street food. A newspaper report decried the unsanitary practice of making ice balls:
Everybody in Singapore must have seen the man with a bucket not too clean, a few bottles of brightly coloured syrups, an inverted plane and a block of ice, with which he makes a handful of ice scrapings, moulds it with his hands into a ball, pours a spoonful of sweet water over it, and hands it to the expectant youngster, doubtless to the greater satisfaction of the mouth of the consumer than his stomach. Dirty, incredibly dirty, no doubt, to the minds of Europeans.14

With increasing numbers of vendors using hand-cranked machines rather than bare hands to shave their ice blocks during the first half of the 20th century, ice balls began to decline in popularity, and had become largely the stuff of memories by the late 1970s.15 Ice kachang, on the other hand, which had become a mainstay of Singapore's streets by the late 1940s, if not earlier, was nominated as a â€˜national treasure' in the mid-1980s.16
Food Standardisation and Branding
The increase of industrially manufactured ingredients and food items, the rise of â€˜middling cuisines',17 hygiene pressures, and the growth of families and family life in Singapore in the 20th century, all helped spur the expansion of a corporate-influenced local food culture. As in much of the rest of the world, processed foods for the masses were originally a middle-class novelty in Singapore. Milo, for instance, was promoted in Singapore since the 1930s as a hygienic, nourishing, sweet, delicious, well-packaged and relatively affordable food item to both European and Asian professionals. These households had both the purchasing power and kitchen facilities to make their own cups of drinking chocolate.18
By the 1950s and 1960s, however, brewing Milo with cow's milk was fast becoming a habit for growing numbers of households trying to raise healthy children. Children who disliked the taste of milk often found it easier to consume it when it was flavoured with the sweetened chocolatey taste of Milo, Ovaltine and other instant malted powders.
With more women entering the formal workforce in the 1960s, many aspirational families also faced the paradox of growing incomes but shrinking time at home. Easy to store and prepare, Milo entrenched itself into breakfast and night-time routines for time-scarce families. As its popularity increased with successive generations, Milo became a ubiquitous product in Singapore households. An aggressively marketed brand that adapted well to local cultures, Milo took on multiple meanings associated with sports, freedom, health, modernity and even fun, ultimately paving the way for the marketing of the Milo Dinosaurâ€”an iced variant of the Milo beverage topped with a heap of Milo powderâ€”in the 1990s.

By this point, the habit of eating sweetened foods every day had become more or less normalised in Singapore's popular food culture, even as people became increasingly aware of the health risks associated with excessive sugar consumption.19
Changing Tastes
Much of tropical Southeast Asia, as any local aficionado of kueh will confirm, is no stranger to sugar and sweetened foods. Many local fruits are sweet, sugarcane is indigenous to the region, and sugar could also be obtained from the sap of many varieties of local palms, including the nipah palm, sugar palm, palmyra palm and coconut palm. South Asia has a similarly long history of sugar cultivation, extraction and consumption.20
East Asia, however, is a different story. For most of China's long history, for instance, the only source of local sugar came from malt syrup, extracted from sprouted and dried grains with water.21 Sugarcane was known mostly as an exotic plant from the far south, whose products were destined for the relatively few urban rich. Even at the end of the 19th century, most Chinese used very modest amounts of sugar in their cuisines.22
Many of Singapore's food offerings with mainland Chinese origins before the 1950s did not contain much sugar or sweetness, even in desserts. However, as incomes rose, and industrially manufactured foods become more widespread and affordable, older food items began to fall by the wayside:
One [food item] that is fast losing popularity is mee teh or flour drink. It is made from flour which is first fried and then steamed. Sugar, lard, fried spring onions and sesame are added to give the drink a spicy taste. Hot water is then poured to the mixture to obtain either a paste or a liquid. Stall owner Madam Ong Bee Hoa comes from China. She claims that the recipe originated from her late husband's forefathers who owned a confectionery shop in China. Her decrepit stall in China Street now sells assorted Chinese food. A few years ago, it was the congregating place of old-timers for a bowl of steaming mee teh.
Singapore's own betel chewing culture was gradually impacted by sweeter versions of the concoction from South Asia, though the preference for sweetness was by no means straightforward. G.T. Lye, a long-time Chinese Peranakan theatre practitioner fond of betel chewing, said:
The Indian preparation of betel nut, I prefer [to the plain Peranakan version], because it's sweet and has a lot of spicesâ€¦ I enjoy it.24
Among the younger generations who still chew betel very occasionally (or remember doing so), taste preferences may be complicated by concerns over personal health. Radhika Narayanan, for instance, prefers the sweeter North Indian version because the southern type â€œburns the mouthâ€ due to the use of chunam [slaked lime]. The burning sensation was linked to her worries about tongue cancer.25
Fish head curry was purportedly invented by Indian chef M.J. Gomez in 1949. He is said to have created this dish chiefly to attract Chinese customers who regarded fish heads as a delicacy. Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons
Intergenerational differences in taste preferences are generally tricky to document, and even harder to rationalise. But perhaps it is worth considering how exposure to new forms of cuisines during one's formative years in Singapore, such as restaurant-style fish-head curry which was introduced here in the 1950s, may have the power to change and broaden palates over time. Fish heads, for instance, are not traditionally used as the main ingredient when Indians cook curry at home. Syamala Senan, a Kerala-born Indian, was described thus:
Syamala doesn't cook fish head curry. She laughs, calling it a dish only found in Singapore. Yet after buying a big fish from the wet market, she cooks the head separately, cuts it into small pieces, adds curry, and serves it with tapioca. She says it is eaten like this across Kerala. Consumed within the kitchen only, not served to visitors. Syamala does't like to eat fish headâ€”she finds it very difficult. Her children are better at eating fish head.26
An Ever-evolving Food Culture
Like all cultural forms, Singapore's 20th century food culture was not static but dynamic and constantly evolving. It was a product of technological change, social and economic forces, and government policies. The introduction and increasing accessibility of refrigeration expanded the variety of ingredients locally available, giving birth to new dishes.
Meanwhile, a growing salaried middle class faced ever-greater choices about what to eat, even as many households and cooks came under pressure to depend heavily on convenience foods. Other developments like the rise of nationalism, hygiene pressures and changing tastes also contributed to the rise and fall of various foods in popular culture. From this historical perspective, a dish deemed progressive or marginal today may, generations later, be celebrated as an iconic offering that is representative of local culture.

Shanghai plaster is a stone-like facade finish highly popular in building construction from the 1920s-60s. Rarely seen on structures today, this plasterwork is a vestige of a bygone era.

Natural stone is among the oldest and most durable materials used in building construction. Take for instance Rome's majestic Pantheon, built in 25â€“27 BCE in granite as a temple for the godsâ€”and still standing today in its full glory. Stone's enduring aesthetic appeal lies in its stately grandeur derived from its properties of stability and solidity. Due to the prohibitive cost and labour it entailed, natural stone was mostly used in Europe for commercial and public edifices that represented political and economic power.
Today, there are no buildings in Singapore made fully of natural stone. However, it is easy to mistake several national monuments in the civic and financial district, such as the Former City Hall and Supreme Court as well as the Fullerton Hotel, as stone structures. These majestic neoclassical buildings are in fact made of reinforced concrete, though clad in a finish that gives them the appearance of expensive stone.
This stone-like finish is known as â€˜Shanghai plaster'. Fourteen out of Singapore's 75 national monuments feature extensive use of Shanghai plasterâ€”a widely popular choice in local construction from the 1920s to '60s. Rarely seen in new buildings today, Shanghai plaster represents the legacy of a material culture from a bygone era.

What is Shanghai Plaster?
Shanghai plaster is a type of cement-based finish developed in the late 19th century. Its innovation was facilitated by the widespread availability of modern Portland cement, a material patented in the UK in 1824. Prior to that, facades were mostly finished with a lime-based mortar mixed with other materials, such as sand and vegetable fibres like straw. With the advent of construction technology and the mass production of Portland cement in the late 19th century, new forms of cement-based plaster were popularised, including Shanghai plaster.
Also known as â€˜granolithic finish', Shanghai plaster is made of exposed finely crushed stone aggregates held together in a cement-based binder. The result is a textured or honed finish like masonry or faux stone. Indeed, by varying the aggregate mixture, Shanghai plaster can simulate the appearance of natural stone.
A close-up of Shanghai plaster, which typically employs an aggregateâ€“cement ratio of 2:1. Commonly used aggregates are granite gravel and fine sands. After cladding a building's facade, water is used to wash the cement binder in order to expose the aggregates.
Since ancient times, facades and finishing materials have been manipulated to create the illusion of a â€˜perfect' appearance. The Romans, for example, decorated their buildings with a lime render that contained stone dust and pozzolana (a volcanic material) to replicate the texture of expensive marble. As the search for aesthetic perfection continued through the times, the idea of using granolithic stone proliferated across borders with architects drawing inspiration from Renaissance-era Italian and French architecture, and employing these styles in their buildings.
The main motivation for developing cement-based granolithic stone plastering was to embellish grey concrete, which was deemed unsightly, dull, and lacking in character. At the same time, the unavailability of a suitable paint for covering concrete also drove the innovation of this material. But the key reason for the popularity of granolithic finish in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was simply because it was more economical in terms of both material and labour costs compared to traditional stone masonry. In addition, granolithic finish was just as hardy compared to softer stones such as sandstone, limestone and some types of marble.
The ease of working with cement-based plasters also allowed for a variety of shapes and textures. When used together with steel reinforcement, granolithic plaster could be cast for architectural features such as cornices with wide overhangs, which was not possible with natural stone. This meant that granolithic finish became a choice material to accommodate rounded facades or more complicated architectural features more often seen in Western classical, neoclassical and Art Deco styles. With the large-scale commercial production of white Portland cement, Shanghai plaster became identified exclusively as an ornamental finish from the turn of the 20th century. Whereas the colour of Portland cement previously ranged from dark greenish grey to brown, the availability of white Portland cement now meant that Shanghai plaster could imitate almost any colour and hue of natural stone by the simple addition of mineral pigments.1 But due to the higher cost of white Portland cement, the use of Shanghai plaster as a finish was limited to external architectural ornamentation facings, particularly for civic and mercantile buildings of significance.
Why Shanghai?
Shanghai plaster did not originate from Shanghai, but was developed in Japan. The material is known by different names throughout the world, the most common being â€˜granolithic finish'. But in Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong, it was colloquially known as â€˜Shanghai plaster'â€”a term that, interestingly, was never used in Shanghai itself.
One of the earliest mentions of â€˜Shanghai plaster' is found in the 1924 annual report of Hong Kong's Public Works Department. In Singapore, however, there is no record of the term up until 1963, when a Straits Times article mentioned it. Prior to that, the finish was referred to by different names, such as â€˜artificial stone plastering',2 â€˜granolithic facing'3 and â€˜special plastering imitating stone'.4
It has been suggested that the â€˜Shanghai' label was derived from the Shanghainese craftsmen specialising in plasterwork who came to Southeast Asia to escape the Second Sino-Japanese War.5 Prior to the war, Shanghai had been a Foreign Concession split between Britain and the United States, where many European construction skills, including the use of granolithic finish, flourished. There are also claims that migrant workers from Shanghai first introduced the technique to Hong Kong, from where it was later exported to construction sectors in various Southeast Asian countries.6
In colonial Singapore, it was common for European architects to engage local contractors for construction work, who in turn hired migrant Chinese craftsmen. The latter included Shanghainese plasterers who were highly skilled in granolithic plastering, having learnt the technique in their home city. The spread of Shanghai plaster therefore represents not only the migration patterns of the Chinese diaspora, but also the concomitant transfer of skills and material culture.
As to why the term â€˜Shanghai plaster' gained traction in Singapore, it is likely that the label embodied certain positive connotations, such as the sense of cosmopolitanism that Shanghai represented, particularly during the interwar period from 1918 to 1939. The association of Shanghai plaster with modern, Western-influenced buildings along the city's waterfront stretch known as the Bund and in other foreign concession zones or colonial territories was obvious: â€˜Shanghai' buildings were a symbol of the best of the West and the East. At the same time, goods that were not made in Shanghai were often passed off as such in order to give Asian consumers the impression that these goods were of superior quality.7
East Meets West: The Spread of Gronolithic Finish in Asia
Following the Meiji Restoration (1868â€“89), Japan saw a revolution of building styles: pseudo-Western classical architecture was now deemed highly desirable for institutional buildings, signalling Japan's desire to project its emerging imperialist agenda. This was a hybrid style combining the Japanese tradition of post-and-beam structures with facades that imitated Western classical architecture.

To achieve this, Japan sought to develop a purely decorative finish based on a cement based granolithic plaster. As Japan is situated in an earthquake-prone region that is unsuitable for heavy masonry structures, a granolithic stone research institution was established in 1880 to develop artificial stone that would simulate the stone appearance of Western classical architecture. In the 1890s, the institute successfully developed its own granolithic finish known as jinzÅishi nuri (äººé€ çŸ³å¡—).
Soon, granolithic finish began to be used on major financial buildings in Japan, such as the Dai-Ichi Ginko (1906) in Kyoto, today's central branch of Mizuho Bank, which combines stonelike cladding with red-brick pseudo-Western architecture. As Japan developed economically, the use of granolithic finish also gained popularity. Though originally seen as a cheaper substitute for granite stone, granolithic plastering gradually came to be appreciated for its own unique aesthetic form.
After the First Sino-Japanese War (1894â€“95), young Japanese architects were sent to Japanese colonial territories such as Taiwan and northeastern China to erect institutional buildings. In these places, granolithic finish was often the material of choice. It was used on buildings such as the distinctive Taipei Water Processing Plant (1908), known as Taipei City Water Museum today.
In 1916, Shanghai saw its first building with granolithic finish: the Union Building, which served Western financial institutions. In Shanghai, the material is referred to as shui shua shi (æ°´åˆ·çŸ³; literally â€˜water-brushed stone') or tai shi zi (æ±°çŸ³å­). It was not long before other buildings along the Bund were also given the granolithic plaster treatment, such as the Glen Line Building and the Shanghai Club Building.

In Shanghai, however, not all buildings dressed in granolithic finish were built in the Western neoclassical style. Several privately owned buildings in Longmen Village, for instance, broke away from the Western form and adopted different architectural styles. One house in the village features dragon figurines made of granolithic finish, which signified a departure from Western tradition and the adoption of local influences. Granolithic plaster thus began to be integrated into local cultural contexts.
From Shanghai, the technique soon spread to British Hong Kong during the interwar years.8 Hybridised construction technology emerged as imported Western techniques were adapted to suit local purposes. For example, the Tang Chi Ngong Building (1931) in the University of Hong Kong features a Chinese traditional entrance arch finished with Shanghai plaster. Kau Yan Church (1932), on the other hand, wears a gothic revival style in granolithic finish. With the expanded use of Shanghai plaster in Hong Kong, the material transcended the imitation of Western neoclassical forms by acquiring its own modern aesthetic.
The Use of Shanghai Plaster in Singapore
As Shanghai plaster gained widespread popularity across colonial cities from the start of the 20th century, it made its way to British Malaya, which had flourishing commercial centres such as Singapore and Melaka. Naturally, the Western neoclassical architecture style was adopted for many important commercial and civic buildings in these towns to project the might of the British Empire.
After the First World War, downtown Singapore saw a major rebuilding. A dozen or more new office blocks, corporate headquarters and bank buildings were erected, while the British government also invested heavily in the construction of new public buildings. Shanghai plaster was the finishing of choice for these new structures as it offered the grandeur and prestige of granite at a fraction of the cost. Its appeal was also boosted by its qualities of durability and weather-resistance, and the flexibility of in-situ rendering and off-site precasting. Unsurprisingly, with all these advantages, the trend of using Shanghai plaster in architecture took off shortly after its introduction in Singapore in the early 1920s.
One of the earliest structures to feature Shanghai plaster was Ocean Building (1921â€“22) along Collyer Quay, commissioned by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company. Its plasterwork was carried out by renowned Italian sculptor Rudolfo Nolli. The rooftop of Ocean Building featured a freestanding pavilion cast in Shanghai plaster which highlighted the building's corner with a striking silhouette. Ocean Building also marked the start of the new Singapore skyline, with a series of prominent structures erected in quick succession over the coming years along the waterfront of Collyer Quay.
With ornamental works adorned with granolithic finish in high demand, Nolli was commissioned for the plasterwork for a number of other seafront buildings, such as the Union Building (1924), Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (1924) and the Fullerton Building (1928). Together, these edifices came to define the new monumental character of Singapore's skyline, particularly when viewed from ocean steamers approaching the harbour. Nolli's most remarkable work, however, was the Fullerton Building (today's Fullerton Hotel), which features an impressive row of free-standing fluted columns with Doric capitals precast in Shanghai plaster.

In the following decade, Nolli would achieve another two feats with Shanghai plaster: the Municipal Building (1929; renamed City Hall in 1951) and the Supreme Court (1939). These two imposing, magnificent civic buildings, which once symbolised British colonial might, remain as icons today and currently house the National Gallery Singapore.
Many of the Shanghai plaster-clad buildings were designed by architectural firm Swan & Maclaren, which was known for creating structures with a massive base and gigantic colonnades whose columns rose through two or more storeys, with equally large cornices and parapetsâ€”the Municipal Building (City Hall) being a prime example. Other works included the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Union Building, Shell House, Overseas Union Centre and Clifford Pierâ€”all of which were finished in Shanghai plaster.
Like many expatriate architects, Nolli employed a team of Chinese artisans in his workshop. He had arrived in Singapore from Bangkok in the early 1920s, bringing with him a number of skilled Chinese craftsmen. Nolli and his team used moulds to form granolithic tilesâ€”a method that was not only economical but also offered the repeatability and consistency necessary for mass production.

By the 1930s, granolithic finish had clearly taken the local construction sector by storm. A 1937 Straits Times report described it thus:
The increasing popularity of bush hammered granolithic facings for buildings in Singapore is an indication of the extreme durability of this material under tropical conditions. The material has the advantage of not discolouring as it is composed of natural coloursâ€” local granite and white cement.9
As the Art Deco style became highly favoured between the 1930s and '50s due to its modernist appeal, Shanghai plaster was even more sought after for its ability to add artistic touches to these buildings that typically featured sharp or rounded edges. Iconic Art Deco-style structures with granolithic finish include the Former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station (1932) and the Cathay Building (1939).

By then, the popularity of Shanghai plaster was no longer limited to spectacular financial and civic buildings in the town centre, but also used for shophouses and smaller mercantile buildings. Shophouses built in the 1940s and '50s, for example, mostly wore the Art Deco style with Shanghai plasterwork as ornamentation. Some surviving examples include boutique hotel The Vagabond Club, a shophouse on Syed Alwi Road with yellow-tinted granolithic finish (1950); the former Dried Goods Guild building (1940) on Ann Siang Road; and various shophouses on Teo Hong Road. All of these are located in conservation areas.
Collyer Quay: Where Shanghai Plaster Reigned Supreme

Collyer Quay is a street and seawall in Singapore's city centre, stretching from the junction of Fullerton Road and Battery Road to D'Almeida Street. For over a century, the waterfront was an important landing point for the unloading and storage of goods transported along the Singapore River, and grew to become a vital link to the commercial centre.
Before its development, the Collyer Quay area was a beach. The seawall from Johnston's Pier to the old Telok Ayer fish market was conceived of in 1858 by Captain George Chancellor Collyer, Chief Engineer of the Straits Settlements, while the land seaward of Commercial Square (later renamed Raffles Place) was reclaimed. Earth from nearby Mount Wallich was excavated to build the roadway behind the wall, and the road was named Collyer Quay upon its completion in 1864.
By 1866, a row of buildings had been erected along Collyer Quay. Due to its attractive seafront location and proximity to the commercial centre, the area saw rapid development in the 20th century with new structures built in quick succession. Many of these buildings were constructed with reinforced concrete and their facades clad in Shanghai plaster. The architecture at Collyer Quay came to define the skyline and image of Singapore until the 1980s.
Collyer Quay's skyline in the 1960s and early '70s was once dominated by the towering 15-storey Shell House (1959), Union Building (1924) and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (1924), all of which were designed by Swan & Maclaren. Other buildings embellished with Shanghai plaster along the waterfront included the Overseas Union Centre (1921) and Clifford Pier (1933).
As commercial buildings that served financial interests, these edifices wore a classical style made possible by the use of Shanghai plaster, which gave them an appearance of solidity and strength. Reflecting grandeur and prestige, the iconic skyline of Collyer Quay was a potent representation of the colony's economic progress at the time.
Four National Monuments with Shanghai Plaster Finish
Former Ministry of Labour Building
Built: 1930

Originally home to the Chinese Protectorate, which oversaw the needs of the Chinese community in Singapore, the building features neoclassical and Art Deco elements such as circular and rectangular motifs on the column capitals and facade. Its Shanghai plaster finish was a mix of crushed granite, sand and coloured glass chips in a yellow-green concrete substrate. Restored in 2014, the building presently houses the Family Justice Courts.
Former Fullerton Building
Built: 1928

The former Fullerton Building (today's Fullerton Hotel) is a major landmark along Collyer Quay. Its past tenants have included the General Post Office, the Singapore Club and various government departments. The edifice has five frontages with enormous two-storey Doric colonnades, which together form a stunning facade. Italian sculptor Rudolfo Nolli was responsible for cladding the building and its ornate mouldings with Shanghai plaster.
Former City Hall
Built: 1929

First opened as the Municipal Building and later renamed as City Hall in 1951, this imposing building is defined by its row of gigantic Corinthian columns. It combines neoclassical and modernist elements, using Shanghai plaster to replicate the stately granite look. Beneath the Shanghai plaster is reinforced concrete. The plasterwork was expertly executed by Rudolfo Nolli and his team of Chinese artisans by in-situ rendering and off-site precasting. Today, the building is part of the National Gallery Singapore.
Former Supreme Court
Built: 1939

Next to the Former City Hall is the former Supreme Court, the last major neoclassical structure built in colonial Singapore. Cutting an impressive silhouette with its coppergreen dome, its Shanghai plaster finish was carried out by Rudolfo Nolli. Interestingly, despite its majestic facade, the interior is much more modest: to save costs, Art Deco rubber tiles resembling marble were used for the flooring. Today, it is part of the National Gallery Singapore.
The Decline of Shanghai Plaster
Granolithic finishing continued to be used in Singapore up until the 1960s when it fell out of favour. Modernity was now no longer signified by the gravitas of stone buildings but by the sheen of soaring glass-and-steel structures. Additionally, the labour-intensive craft of producing Shanghai plaster became a deterrent for contractors who wanted to build quickly and cheaply as Singapore's economy boomed in the 1980s.
Tracing the history of Shanghai plaster reveals the extent of skill transfer that came with migration flows as well as the prevailing architectural trends of the early decades of the 20th century influenced by the British Empire. While many Shanghai plaster-clad buildings have been lost to redevelopment over the years, thankfully some still stand today as vestiges of a bygone era.

It is commonly assumed that the ethnic compositions of the historic conservation areas of Chinatown, Kampong Glam, Little India and Emerald Hill conform to Singapore's official classification of â€˜races' â€” â€˜Chinese, Malay, Indian and â€˜Others'. But looking back at history, we now know that, in reality, these neighbourhoods were multi-ethnic in character. Similarly, there were other neighbourhoods whose compositions also defied this commonly used framing, one that ignores many erstwhile places and communities that thrived in colonial Singapore.
Kampong Melaka, Kampong Bengkulu, Kampong Serani and Kampong Dhoby were four such neighbourhoods that used to be located in the city centre, but few traces of them remain today. Here we unearth stories of the social fabric and built environment of these old kampongs.

Notes
Kampong Melaka
The former Kampong Melaka comprised northern and southern sections separated by the Singapore River. North Kampong Melaka was located in what is now the historic district of Clarke Quay, while South Kampong Melaka encompassed today's Angus, Cumming, Fisher, Kerr, Keng Cheow and Solomon streets, near the Clarke Quay train station. However, the original Kampong Melaka was in fact situated further downstream, at the northern bank of the Singapore River where the Parliament House currently stands.
With the East India Company's establishment of a trading settlement in Singapore in 1819, the Melakans, whom the British Resident and Commandant Major William Farquhar had encouraged to relocate to Singapore, settled upriver from Kampong Temenggong (roughly the site of today's Asian Civilisations Museum). They formed the first Melakan settlement in Singapore, which was mentioned in an autobiographical account of the early years of Singapore after the British arrival, the Hikayat Abdullah (1849). But besides the Melakans and the Temenggong settlement, the Chinese â€” mainly Teochews â€” also lived among them.

However, Raffles had other plans for the northern bank of the river: he wanted to reserve it for official or civic uses. In June 1819, he issued instructions for all the Chinese and Malays to move to the southern bank of the river. The Chinese would form the enclave known as â€˜Chinese Town', stretching from the mouth of the river to Presentment Bridge (also known as Jackson Bridge; later replaced by Elgin Bridge), and a â€˜Malay Town' for the Malay community that would be sited upstream of the bridge.
However, Raffles's instructions for a Malay Town to be set up just inland from the Chinese Town was subsequently amended in two ways. First, his second set of instructions resulted in the area just slightly upriver being designated as â€˜Chulia Campong' in the 1822 plan of Singapore town, popularly known as the Jackson Plan. Second, what in fact formed organically on the site was a settlement called Kampong Melaka, comprising a mixed community of Malays and Jawi Peranakans from Melaka, as well as Teochews and other groups.
Kampong Melaka's composition demonstrates a common theme in Singapore's colonial history: areas demarcated for specific â€˜races' or ethnic groups quickly morphed into diverse, mixed neighbourhoods even as early as the first two decades of British arrival in Singapore.
A Multiethnic Settlement
Kampong Melaka was home to a diverse, multiethnic community. Many of its residents came from Melaka and comprised Malays, Chinese and Jawi Peranakans. The latter group included the author of the Hikayat Abdullah, Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, better known as Munshi Abdullah. A resident of Kampong Melaka in the 1840s, Abdullah was hired by Raffles as his Tamil-Arab Malay language teacher and clerk.1
The Jawi Peranakans, who were Muslims of Indian and Malay extraction, were particularly prominent as property owners in the area. They included Hajee Saiboo (who owned a shophouse within the grounds of Omar Mosque), Hadjee Mahamad Arip2 (four shophouses on Omar Road), Mona Kadei Mydin3 (four shophouses on Keng Cheow Street) and Sultan Meydin (a shed on Wayang Street). Arab, Bugis, Malay and Chinese families also owned properties in the vicinity of Omar Mosque, attesting to the heterogenous character of the kampong.
The Chinese in Kampong Melaka
Kampong Melaka was an important neighbourhood for the Chinese community, particularly the Teochews. The concentration of prominent Teochews in this area was largely due to Temenggong Abdul Rahman's efforts to cultivate plantations in pre-colonial Singapore. The Teochews, Bugis and Malays had been operating gambier plantations across Singapore at the behest of the Temenggong, the island's Malay chief and de facto ruler before British colonial rule. At least 20 plantations existed in the immediate vicinity of the town when Raffles arrived in Singapore.4 Several mansions owned by eminent Teochew merchants were sited along the river and nearby at Hill Street and High Street, including that of Seah Eu Chin,5 who along with other family members were highly influential merchants. Near the Teochew market in Kampong Melaka was Chin Hin Street, named after Seah's business in 1870.6
Places of Worship
Being a predominantly Muslim settlement, Kampong Melaka's focal point was Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka (Omar Kampong Melaka Mosque) built in 1820, originally a simple wooden structure with an attap roof. Originally located off Mosque Square, accessed from Omar Road (both expunged) off Havelock Road, the mosque compound featured several rumah limas (hip-roof houses) and two rows of shophouses. Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka bears the name of its benefactor: Pangeran Syarif Syed Omar bin Ali Aljunied, one of Singapore's pioneers and a Hadhrami Arab who arrived here from Palembang in southeastern Sumatra. His son Syed Abdullah rebuilt the mosque in brick in 1855, which later underwent several major reconstructions.
As there was also a significant Chinese population residing in the neighbourhood, in 1826 the Teochews established their main temple, Wak Hai Cheng Bio, close to the south bank of the Singapore River opposite the former Kampong Temenggong. Five decades later in 1876, Tan Seng Haw/Po Chek Kio7 was built on Magazine Road as the assembly hall and temple of the Tan family from Melaka. The temple was noted for its role in mitigating disputes and providing protection for newly arrived Chinese immigrants. In 1885, the temple was rebuilt and named Tan Si Chong Su, which was gazetted as a national monument in 1974.

Chinese Wayang Houses and Opium Shops in Kampong Melaka
Six Chinese theatre halls were known to exist in Kampong Melaka, three of which were located along the now-expunged Wayang Street. Wayang is the Malay and Javanese term for â€˜theatre', which, interestingly, has become part of the vocabulary for describing traditional Chinese opera. Heng Wai Sun (Qing Wei Xin; åº†ç»´æ–°) and Heng Seng Peng (Qing Sheng Ping; åº†å‡å¹³) were two theatre halls on Wayang Street.8 Both were venues for Cantonese opera, but the latter also hosted Beijing and Hokkien operas.9
In addition to theatre halls, two opium shops were constructed in 1910 at 14 Merchant Road and 44 Merchant Road, operated by members of the Seah clan, Seah Liang Seah and Seah Eng Kiat respectively. Another opium shop opened two years later at 71 New Market Road, run by one Tan Jui Eng.
Kampong Bengkulu
Kampong Bengkulu (Bencoolen) encompassed the properties at present-day Albert Street, Prinsep Street, Bencoolen Street, Short Street, Middle Road and Waterloo Street. This was where a group of Malays from Bencoolen (Bengkulu in Indonesia today), whom Raffles had brought to Singapore, made their home.
Newspaper notices from early as 1844 indicate that addresses at Queen Street and Church Street (later renamed Waterloo Street) were usually accompanied by the words â€˜Campong Bencoolen'. For instance, a forum letter contributor to the local newspaper in 1846 wrote â€œQueen Street, Campong Bencoolenâ€ and signed off as â€œA Resident in Church Street, Campong Bencoolenâ€.
Interestingly, although the area was designated as the â€˜European Town', this label was never used by the locals, who instead named the area according to how they perceived it. In Hokkien, Albert Street was known as Kam Kong Mang Ku Lu (Kampong Bengkulu), â€˜Mang Ku Lu' being the transliteration of â€˜Bengkulu'.

Diverse Places of Worship
At the centre of Kampong Bengkulu was a mosque of the same name, built in 1845. Like the mosque in Kampong Melaka, Masjid Kampong Bengkulu was a recipient of Syed Omar bin Ali Aljunied's wakaf (a permanent endowment for charity). Pre-dating the mosque, however, were two churches: the Catholic Chapel (1833) and the Malay Chapel (1843; also known as Greja Keasberry10), which in 1885 became the Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church. The existence of these early churches in Kampong Bengkulu can be traced to its earlier demarcation as the European quarter before the kampong took shape. Records indicate that by the mid-19th century, Malays and other groups were present in the area alongside Europeans and Eurasians as both residents and building owners.
In 19th-century Singapore, the colourful, multiethnic composition of the area was apparent with the diversity of its religious landmarks. The latter half of the century saw the establishment of St Joseph's Church (1853) on Victoria Street by the Portuguese Mission; Bethesda Chapel (1866) on Bras Basah Road; Sri Krishnan Temple (1870), Maghain Aboth Synagogue (1878) and Kwan Im Thong Temple (1884) on Waterloo Street; Our Lady of Lourdes Church (1886) on Queen Street catering to Tamils from Pondicherry, India; and the Tamil Methodist Church on Short Street (1887).

Forgotten Lorongs
A unique feature of Kampong Bengkulu was its relatively large building plots. These were originally intended for the substantial mansions or compound houses used by the European community. While some of these plots were used for large houses, others were subdivided for the building of shophouses. Because the shophouses occupied only a third of the large plot sizes, property developers created alleys or lanes (lorong in Malay) to access the interior of the plots and built microtenements there. The only surviving example of such a land division in the area is Prinsep Place, formerly known as Cheang Jim Chuan (Chwan) Place.
The developers of four lorongs in Kampong Bengkulu have been identified as Hadjee Mohamed Bin Abdul Rahim (Lorong Sakai), Hussensah Marican (Lorong Serai), Haji Kader (Lorong Sepang) and S. Kassim (Lorong Kassim). It is significant that these four personalities were either Malay or Indian; Haji Kader and S. Kassim were Tamil Muslim merchants from Bombay who were part of the Jawi Peranakan community.
Indeed, there was an exceptionally large number of Arabs and Tamil Muslims who owned properties or lived in Kampong Bengkulu. A search of land records from the 1840s shows that more than half of the total number of plots at lower Prinsep Street, lower Bencoolen Street and lower Waterloo Street, as well as the northwestern corner of Bras Basah and North Bridge roads, were owned by Arabs or Indian Muslims.

Kampong Serani
Within Kampong Bengkulu was Kampong Serani in the vicinity of Queen Street and Manila Street. â€˜Serani' is the Malay equivalent of the Arabic â€˜Nasrani' (Nazarene), which refers to Christians. Among Malay speakers of the past, Portuguese Eurasians, who were typically Catholic, were known as Serani.
Kampong Serani, which was bounded by Hokkien, Manila and Queen streets, was called Sek-kia-ni Koi (Serani Street; a transliteration of â€˜Serani') in Hokkien.11 Kampong Serani was known for its Eurasian community, the offspring of intermarriages between local women and early European settlers.
Burgeoning Catholic and Christian Populations
A Eurasian neighbourhood was clustered around the Portuguese Mission, which later built St Joseph's Church in 1953. Prior to this, members of the Portuguese Mission community used to gather at the house of Jose d'Almeida, a Portuguese surgeon who came to Singapore to start a dispensary and subsequently became a successful merchant. D'Almeida's residence was a mansion along the seafront Beach Road before the coastline was pushed out by reclamation.
Although predominantly Catholic and Christian, the resident makeup of Kampong Serani was far from homogeneous. Besides the community of Catholic Eurasians, there were many other groups affiliated to various Catholic missions and Christian denominations, whose churches and communities were embedded in the area. These communities were in fact multiethnic and multilingual.

Initially, most Catholics worshipped at Singapore's only Catholic chapel on Bras Basah Road, built in 1833 at the site that was later occupied by St Joseph's Institution, and today the Singapore Art Museum. As the congregation grew, however, another larger place of worship was completed in 1847 â€” the Church of the Good Shepherd located at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Queen Street. Subsequently, more churches in the surrounding area sprang up catering to specific ethnic groups and Christian denominations as the various communities expanded.
The first Catholic community to establish its own church was the Portuguese Mission, who built the original St Joseph's Church in 1853 on Victoria Street (the building we see today is a newer construction dating to 1912). Chinese- and Tamil-speaking Catholics were served by the Church of Saints Peter and Paul on Queen Street that was built in 1870. As the Tamil congregation expanded, however, they moved to the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes on nearby Ophir Road, founded by the French mission from Pondicherry in 1888. A short distance away at Short Street, the Tamil Methodist Church was built here in 1887, signalling the burgeoning Methodist community in the area.
Meanwhile, the Baba Malay-speaking Chinese Peranakan community from Melaka formed the Straits Chinese Church, also referred to as the Malay Chapel, in 1843. This later became Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church, which was also known as the Prinsep Street Baba Church. Besides locally born Straits Chinese, the Chinese Peranakan community from Bencoolen and some Teochew speaking Christians also joined this congregation. Another Baba Malay-speaking church, Straits Chinese Methodist Church, at the intersection of Middle Road and Waterloo Street was inaugurated in 1894.
Compound Shophouses
Many Eurasians lived in compound shophouses â€” a dwelling formed by setting back a row of shophouses or terrace townhouses and enclosing the front yard with a low brick wall, thus creating a small front compound. The houses were also raised from the ground with a short flight of steps leading from the front yard to the terrace. At one point, there were 15 rows of such compound shophouses in the vicinity of Kampong Serani.

Zena Tessensohn nÃ©e Clarke recalled living in a bungalow on a lane opposite the Church of Saints Peter and Paul:
â€œMany Eurasian families lived in Queen Streetâ€¦ We used to visit each other's compounds or gardens and play hide-and-seek and catching. The boys used to fly kites and play marblesâ€¦ [The] younger members mixed and played together a great deal, especially as the open compound of the older row of houses allowed for participation by large numbers in games such as hantu galah, rounders, etc.â€
However, this architectural typology did not extend to the newer style of shophouses, as Marie Cockburn nÃ©e de Souza remembered:
â€œThe newer second row of shophouses had no common compound. Rather, each house had an enclosed concrete area leading from a gate to the front verandah of the house. This area could be used for parking a car or for lining potted plants.â€
As the Eurasian community flourished in Kampong Serani, so did institutions and businesses owned by Eurasians that supported their social and economic lives. There was a Eurasian-run pineapple factory on Bencoolen Street as well as an Italian bakery and the Mercantile Institution on Queen Street, the latter founded by P.E. Pereira, who also served as its principal. One of the compound houses on the same street was converted into the Mercantile Hostel.

Kampong Dhoby
Within the vicinity of Kampong Bengkulu, near Kampong Serani was Kampong Dhoby (also spelt â€˜Dobie' and â€˜Dobi') at the upper end of Queen Street. This was a neighbourhood inhabited by a North Indian community. In Tamil, this area was known as Dobi Kampam, kampam being a transliteration of the Malay â€˜kampong'. Maps from 1842 â€“ 45 indicate that Kampong Dhoby had existed by then, while a newspaper notice from 19 May 1842 mentions a â€œCampong Dhobyâ€.12
Kampong Dhoby owes its origins to the location of the Indian military cantonment here in the 1820s as well as the section of the Rochor River where Indian washermen, or dhobies, washed and dried their laundry. The soldiers at the cantonment were recruited from Bengal and brought to Singapore to maintain law and order. The cantonment in the vicinity of Short Street existed for about six years before it shifted to Outram Road. It was described as a â€œlarge exercising groundâ€¦ roughly bounded by Prinsep St., Albert St., Queen St., and Bras Basahâ€.13 However, even after the relocation of the cantonment, the Indian presence remained, leading to the formation of Kampong Dhoby.
In 1906, Masjid Kampong Bengkulu became known as Masjid Hanafi, following a change in the mosque's trusteeship to Hanafi adherents of the Muslim faith. Just two years later, another Hanafi mosque was established in 1908 â€” Queen Street Hanafi Mosque, which was commonly known as Masjid Benggali. These developments attest to the shifting demographics of Kampong Bengkulu and its growing number of Indian Muslims, many of whom subscribed to the Hanafi school.
Besides the two mosques, the kampong was also home to one of the earliest Sikh temples in Singapore, the predecessor of today's Central Sikh Temple on Towner Road. This Sikh temple (gurdwara) was first set up in 1912 in a house at 175 Queen Street, which had been acquired by a group of Sikhs led by a Sindhi merchant named Wassiamull. The gurdwara represented the Sikh community's early attempt at self-organisation, and the site soon became a centre for Sikh social life. The confluence of activities at the temple earned it the name Wadda Gurdwara, or Big Temple. In 1920â€“21, the building was converted into the Central Sikh Temple, and remained here until 1977 when the land it sat on was acquired by the government.

Another major landmark in this area was the first office and printing press of the Utusan Melayu newspaper, which published its maiden issue in 1939. The pioneer Malay-language press occupied a three-storey shophouse on Queen Street. However, the premises were destroyed during the Japanese Occupation, and the press subsequently reopened on Cecil Street.

Often tucked away from sight, informal shrines, sometimes honouring deities from multiple religions in a single altar, lend colour â€” and spirituality â€” to the island's urban environs.

It is not unusual to come across diverse places of worship in multiethnic and multireligious Singapore. Some are humble, like Masjid Hang Jebat, tucked away in leafy suburban surroundings, while others, such as Sultan Mosque and Central Sikh Temple, are majestic structures that occupy sprawling grounds. These places of worship sit on land plots that the government has designated for religious purposes. In a land-scarce country like Singapore, the use of public space is highly regulated.1
But hidden in the nooks and crannies of public and secular spaces are some small but important shrines that have mushroomed, and sometimes been forgotten, over time. These â€˜wayside shrines' are usually makeshift altars that occupy unofficial spaces in the urban environment. They may be found practically anywhereâ€”along roadside and railway tracks, at bus stops, carparks, loading docks, construction sites, factories, under expressways, in shopping centres, hawker centres, wet markets, public housing void decks, cemeteries, and even in secluded forested areas.

These shrines infuse sacrality into Singapore's urban landscape, defying the neat binaries of what is regarded as sacred and secular, as well as legal and illegal in the city-state. Created and sustained by different communities, these public shrines are incredibly diverse. Their scale ranges from a modest altar set up at the foot of a banyan tree (regarded as sacred in several religions practised in the region) to more extensive standalone constructions with shelters. These shrines can serve a variety of deities, such as Sufi and Malay saints, South Asian gods and Taoist deities, but more interestingly, a single shrine may feature deities from multiple religions. Though marginal and easily overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature, these â€˜hidden' shrines reveal significant narratives that complement and extend those of larger, more established official places of worship.
Different Deities under One Roof
One of the most remarkable features of these wayside shrines is that many of them house deities from different religions under the same roof. A common deity worshipped at these shrines is Datuk Kong, who has Chinese and Malay origins. The deity is also known as Na Du Gong and Na Tuk Gong in Mandarin or Datuk Keramat in Malay. Datuk and kong means â€˜grandfather' in Malay and Mandarin respectivelyâ€”a reflection of the guardian spirit's Sino-Malay roots.
Worshipped in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, Datuk Kong's power of protection is limited to the area where he resides, and his shrines are typically small. Besides general safeguarding, devotees may also ask for lucky numbers to buy lottery tickets. A researcher of Datuk Kong shrines in Penang writes of the deity's functions:
â€œ[Datuk Kong] guard[s] worshippers against evil spirits and keep them from physical harm and injuries including traffic accidents, infestations by snakes and rats, termites, hornets, centipedes, scorpions, infliction of wounds from nails and broken glass and falling from trees and buildings and so forth. [Datuk Kong] safeguard[s] residents from natural disasters such as fire, lightning, floods, storms, landslides, epidemics and other catastrophes. In other words, Datuk Kongs safeguard life and property, and ensure the general well-being of the community.2â€
Datuk Kong figurines can be identified by some form of Malay dress, most commonly the songkok or haji cap. This anthropomorphised representation of Datuk Kong is believed to have originated in Malaysia in the 1980s3. Other versions of the deity are dressed in a baju Panjang (long, loose-fitting tunic) and a sarong. He is usually depicted as seated, with legs apart, in a projection of authority. Despite his majestic aura, the deity wears a kindly demeanour and is said to exude a â€˜grandfatherly' presence with his beard, smile and portly belly. Occasionally, Datuk Kong is accompanied by a pet tiger.

Located in a carpark near Dickson Road in Little India is a collection of shrines, two of which worship Datuk Kong. They are placed on either side of a bamboo clump. The Taoist Tua Pek Kong, commonly known as the God of Prosperity, can also be found at one of the shrines, along with several Thai Buddha heads sitting atop a metal filing cabinet. The pink-coloured altar with its sculptures of Buddhist and Taoist deities were apparently donated by a grateful devotee who had won the lottery.
Other deities commonly found in wayside shrines are the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, or Guanyin, who represents compassion and mercy, worshipped by Buddhists and some Hindus; and the Hindu elephant-headed Ganesha, whom devotees pray to for help in eradicating obstacles in their lives. Both deities attract worshippers from different religious faiths.
The prevalence of these shrines reflects the multireligious social fabric of Singapore, made up of immigrants and transient workers who brought along their respective religious beliefs and gods. For instance, outside the well-known Thai enclave of Golden Mile Complex is a large Thai Buddhist shrine dedicated to the four-faced Phra Phrom, also known as the Hindu god Brahma. Phra Phrom has a popular following in Singapore and statues of the deity are found in various informal shrines across the main island as well as on Pulau Ubin.

Ephemerality
As these shrines are informal in nature and not officially recognised by the authorities, their existence becomes very precarious in fast-changing Singapore. Many of such shrines have disappeared over time â€” removed due to their illegal status or to make way for urban renewal.
In a few instances, they have been relocated by their caretakers if new homes could be found. Such wayside shrines are thus marked by a sense of ephemerality. This uncertainty creates an urgency to document these sites and their stories, including those of their communities, before they vanish from the landscape.
The vulnerability of these informal sacred spaces is highlighted in the 2010 destruction of the keramat (shrine) dedicated to the Sufi saint Siti Maryam (1830sâ€“54). The term keramat can refer to several things, one of which is the sacred burial site of a Muslim saint. For decades, worshippers would visit the tomb of Siti Maryam in the Kallang area to pay their respects and seek her blessings. She was believed to be a miracle healer who could bring about clement weather, ensure employment and protect seafaring groups, including fishermen, sailors and coastal communities, by interceding with God on their behalf. Despite protests by the followers of Siti Maryam, her keramat was exhumed and demolished in April 2010 to make way for a new development. Such stories are not uncommon across different religious communities in Singapore.
A Google Street View Image from 2009 of the Keramat Siti Maryam shows the shrine and some chairs for the caretakers and devotees to rest.
More fortunate was a shrine along Niven Road that had been relocated multiple times between 2009 and 2020. Not only was it physically moved, its form, gods and identity also underwent transformation over the years. In 2016, it was located on the public pavement adjacent to a private property. Four years later, the shrine's caretakers received a notice from a government agency ordering the shrine to be moved to a private space. As a compromise, the caretakers who worked nearby came up with an ingenious idea: they relocated the shrine, embedding it within a wall enclosing their private compound, with one side of the shrine jutting out just enough for the public to access it from the outside for worship.
In fact, the research team later discovered that the shrine was once located under a gigantic banyan tree on Niven Road. It is notable that over the span of a decade, through the three relocations of the shrine, its identity transformed from a tree shrine to a roadside shrine. Along the way, the pantheon of gods worshipped at the shrine also expanded: the original Taoist deities were subsequently joined by gods from other religions, including Hinduism and Buddhism.

Given the temporal nature of these wayside shrines, the Hidden Shrines database was developed to document their origins and history.
The Hidden Shrines Database
To be launched by the first quarter of 2023, the Hidden Shrines database is an online crowdsourcing initiative that documents small, informal but no less important shrines in Singapore. The digital humanities project was conceived by a team comprising members from Nanyang Technological University's School of Computer Science and Engineering, and the School of Art, Design and Media. Computer scientist Dr Owen Noel Newton Fernando and a team of students led the development of the website.
Taking cues from the key characteristics of the shrines â€” primarily their intimate connection with their respective locationsâ€”the project fuses traditional art historical methods with a geographic information system, or GIS. The former includes fieldwork, photography and archival research, while the latter refers to the use of geospatial data as well as tools for recording, organising, analysing, manipulating and displaying that data.
Based on the shrines' geospatial information, the website visualises their locations all over Singapore. The site features photographs of the shrines, either taken by the research team or contributed by the public. Besides providing a visual record of the shrines, the time stamps of the photographs become crucial research data as the shrines are highly vulnerable to destruction and relocation.

Additionally, the database includes information such as the date the shrines were established, the deities worshipped, patterns of patronage, ritual activities, architectural features and audio stories. This allows researchers and the public to study the shrines and discover narratives that may otherwise remain hidden.
The online platform aims to encourage physical encounters with the shrines. Users such as researchers, heritage enthusiasts and devotees can locate shrines using the website and then visit the actual sites. There, they may interact with caretakers, make offerings or participate in religious rituals on auspicious days. The database seeks to promote awareness of these small sacred spaces that have become invaluable repositories of tangible and intangible cultural heritage in Singapore. Apart from functioning as an archive, the website is also a means of sustaining the city's hidden and less familiar cultural practices.

Caretakers and Devotees
Informal shrines are built and maintained by a communal network comprising caretakers and devotees, with many of the shrines sharing a common characteristic: the role of the elderly in their care and maintenance.4 King-Chung Siu and Thomas Kong, who conducted a study of such shrines in Hong Kong and Singapore, noted that â€œthese shrines occupy the margins of the urban fabric, but serve unintended social and religious functions, primarily for the community of eldersâ€.5

Mohamed Hassan, fondly known as Wak Ali Janggut6 (Bearded Ali) for his trademark long white beard, was the de facto custodian of Keramat Siti Maryam for a quarter of a century. Now in his 80s, Wak Ali used to live on the premises of the shrine, in a simple makeshift room with nothing more than a mattress and a small cupboard, and a mosquito net for protection.
Even though Wak Ali had a flat to live in, he preferred to live near the shrine so that he could care for it. While the shrine still existed, his daily chores included sweeping up dead leaves in the compound and replacing old flower offerings with fresh ones. He was known for his fervent prayers and used to worship with the devotees.7
Wak Ali was not just a caretaker who maintained the cleanliness of the sacred space; he was also a living repository of stories about the keramat and the unofficial custodian of its history. He shared his knowledge about the shrine's secret spiritual passageway:
â€œThe tree at the eastern end of the keramat contains a passageway that is the point of entry for spirits â€” this is the entry into the cave, [and the] cave is like a palace.8â€
The narratives surrounding these shrines range from personal histories tied to the sites to supernatural incidents that may seem spurious and therefore incredulous to a nonbeliever. However, it is precisely such narratives that impart social significance to these sites. Regardless of their credibility, these anecdotes, which are transmitted firsthand or retold through other sources, give life and character to the shrines. Another caretaker of Keramat Siti Maryam, Wak Aiyim, had been visiting the shrine since he was a child. Recalling his supernatural encounters, he spoke of vision he once saw of Malay folk heroes:
â€œAfter I had finished work â€” I used to be a barber at a tree behind [the northeastern side of the] shrine â€” I fell asleep only to be woken up by a vision. I was shocked when I saw the faces of Hang Tuah, Hang Kasturi, Hang Jebat, Hang Lekir and Hang Lekiu on the five trunks of the tree. I then wrapped five pieces of yellow cloth9 around the trunks of a tree with five stemsâ€¦ Other spirits are at the shrine always to watch over people and reveal their powers whenever there is misconduct.10â€
There are also female caretakers who help establish and maintain informal shrines in Singapore. For instance, Madam Quek was the informal caretaker of the Monkey God Tree Shrine that appeared in Jurong West Street 42 in 2007. The shrine was erected after some people observed an outline on a tree bark bearing resemblance to the Chinese monkey god Sun Wukong and the Hindu monkey god Hanuman.

The phenomenon drew large crowds of devotees who presented offerings and asked for blessings. Subsequently, calluses of two nearby trees were also ascribed sacred significance as representations of Guanyin and Ganesha. Although the initial enthusiasm shown by both Taoist and Hindu devotees faded, Madam Quek, who lives in the vicinity, continued to visit the shrines often, offering incense and tidying up the shrines. Sadly, these shrines have since been removed by the authorities for encroaching on state land.

Another female caretaker is Madam Veni, a priestess at the Sree Eranchery Bhagavathi Temple, which began as a family tree shrine in the 1940s devoted to the Hindu goddess Kali. Situated close to the former Keretapi Tanah Melayu railway tracks in Kranji, the shrine was located on a plot of state land that the family believed to be theirs. Over time, the shrine evolved into a larger temple with spaces to worship multiple Hindu gods and goddesses: Vishnu, Lakshmi, Mariamman, Ganesh, Shiva and Muneeswaran.
Madam Veni's relationship with Kali goes back to her childhood days when the goddess revealed herself to her. She would occasionally go into a trance, during which Kali would communicate through her. For many years, Madam Veni conducted prayers and maintained the temple.11 In September 2020, the temple was demolished after the Singapore Land Authority delivered a notice for its removal.

Typically, many of such shines have self-appointed caretakers who preserve the sanctity of these places so that worshippers can continue to pray and pay their respects. Over time, communities also form organically around these sacred spaces. At some shrines, you may see devotees and caretakers socialising at times, sitting on plastic chairs and chatting.
Re-enchanting the Everyday
For sociologist Terence Heng, temporary roadside altars and shrines function as â€œâ€˜transient aesthetic markers' that reify the imaginary spiritual realm, allowing individuals to temporarily overlay spiritual and sacred space onto the physical and material spaceâ€.12 Indeed, wayside shrines produce and expand sacred space in response to the spatial constraints imposed by the state. Strict zoning laws, the prohibitive cost of land and high-density living make these informal shrines an appealing option for devotees.
Above all, the shrines are repositories of religious practices that are rooted in everyday life. Although much more modest compared to official religious establishments, these sacred spaces nonetheless represent aspects of ordinary lives, their individual and neighbourhood histories intersecting with national narratives. By paying closer attention to our surroundings, we may yet realise how much sacrality and religious heritage are infused into our everyday environments.

The laborious work of conservation is often invisible to museum visitors, despite it being so central to the preservation of our national heritage. MUSE SG delves into the conservation process behind two 19th-century boundary markers.
MUSE SG Volume 15 Issue 02 - July 2022

Image Above: Conservator Berta MaÃ±as Alcaide (left) and Sharon Lim, a colleague from the Heritage Research and Assessment department, conducting an initial visual assessment of the boundary markers upon their arrival at the Heritage Conservation Centre.
A key part of the museum experience is encountering stories told through historical objects. We stand before an artefact, admiring its form and the layers of meaning it holds. We imagine it existing during the time of its creation â€” which could be as far back as a millennium ago. After all this time past, perhaps buried beneath the earth or underwater, perhaps in a collector's home, it finally finds a permanent abode in the museum, where it is given a new lease of life.
But usually invisible to the visitor's gaze is the laborious conservation work carried out before the object makes its way to being encased in the vitrine. How did an artefact look when it was first discovered and what was the conservation process like before it was housed in the museum, where we now view it in its preserved form?
We trace the conservation journey of two 19th-century artefacts â€” merchants Sim Liang Whang's Teck Kee and Tan Kim Seng's Hong Hin boundary markers â€” and examine the complexity of the behind-the-scenes work. Discovered in 2021, the condition in which the markers were found is vastly different from what they are today, thanks to the work of Berta MaÃ±as Alcaide, Senior Conservator (Objects), Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC), who specialises in stone conservation.
The Teck Kee boundary marker, after conservation treatment, with the Chinese characters â€˜å¾·è¨˜ç•Œ' (Teck Kee's Boundary) at the top. Chop Teck Kee was a business run by merchant Sim Liang Whang. The granite marker measures 82 x 17 x 14 cm and weighs 26 kg.
The Hong Hin marker is still undergoing conservation treatment. The Chinese characters â€˜ è±Šèˆˆå±± ' (Hong Hin's Estate) are engraved at the top. Hong Hin was a business owned by eminent merchant Tan Kim Seng. Below the Chinese characters are Tan's initials â€˜T.K.S.'. The granite marker measures 88.5 x 25 x 12 cm and weighs 62 kg.
The Markers' Original State
Boundary markers were installed in Singapore from 1881 onwards to delineate the boundaries of privately owned land. Both the Teck Kee and Hong Hin boundary markers, made of granite from a local quarry, were discovered near each other in the Ulu Pandan area of Dover Forest. Two-thirds of the Hong Hin marker had been buried vertically with the remaining portion exposed, while the Teck Kee marker was completely underground. After a careful excavation, they were sent to HCC for assessment, analysis and treatment.
The two boundary markers newly excavated from Dover Forest before being sent to the Heritage Conservation Centre.
The first thing that a conservator does upon receiving a new artefact is to assess its condition. MaÃ±as notes:
â€œThe boundary markers arrived at HCC covered with mud and in a very wet condition. The exposed part of the [Hong Hin] marker had biological matter; these may include plant, algae, moss and lichen. Anything that enters HCC with biological growth or pests would have to be treated first to prevent contamination.â€
MaÃ±as applied ethanol to eliminate all biological matter on the markers, and mud was removed with deionised water and soft brushes. This process of cleaning had to be done meticulously as there were areas of engravings on the stone with paint remains; it was imperative that the paint would not be accidentally removed during the cleaning procedure. Hence, for the carvings, she cleared the mud slowly and carefully using cotton swabs.

The conservator carefully cleaning mud from engraved portions of the boundary marker with deionized water using cotton swabs. This had to be carried out slowly so that paint pigments on the engraved areas would not be accidentally removed.
After cleaning the outermost layer of the markers, granite particles were observed to be missing on the surface as a result of erosion due to environmental conditions. At the same time, carvings on the stones became more apparent. The Hong Hin marker is one of the few known boundary markers carved with both Chinese and English characters: â€˜è±Šèˆˆå±±' (Hong Hin's Estate; â€˜Hong Hin' was the name of the business owned by eminent merchant Tan Kim Seng); and â€˜T.K.S.', Tan's initials, below the Chinese characters. The Teck Kee marker, on the other hand, had only â€˜å¾·è¨˜ç•Œ' (Teck Kee's Boundary) engraved on it. Chop Teck Kee was a business owned by Sim Liang Whang. The two boundary markers are the only ones associated with the two pioneer businessmen that have been found.
Some black paint was also observed on the exposed section of the Hong Hin marker over the Chinese characters, as well as on the Teck Kee marker. On closer inspection, MaÃ±as discovered red paint fragmentsâ€”which proved to be the original colour of the carvingsâ€” some of which were beneath the black paint. Red paint was only found on the Chinese characters for both markers, not the English initials for the Hong Hin marker. As a result of natural degradation, remains of the original red paint were minimal, in poor condition and fragile.
Both black and red paint were found at the engraved portions of both boundary markers. But the red pigments were minimal, in poor condition and fragile due to natural degradation.
The Question of â€˜Originality'
Following the discovery of the red paint, conservators discussed with museum curators whether to retain the black paint, or to remove it and thus reinstate it to its â€˜original' state. The removal process would be irreversible.
Although parts of the red paint had been painted over with black, the state in which the stones were discovered also constitutes a part of their history. Is there ever an â€˜original' state for a historical artefact that has undergone manmade and natural changes over a long period of time? This is a perennial issue faced by conservators: which â€˜version' of the object to treat for preservation.
The conservators and curators jointly assessed the Teck Kee marker and its contextual history, as well as the different possibilities of conservation treatment. Weighing the erasure of a part of the object's history against the importance of that particular feature to the artefact's biographical history, the team's eventual recommendation was to remove the black paint as it was not considered original. Furthermore, it would be â€˜visually disturbing', as retaining the black paint would affect the legibility of the Chinese characters.
MaÃ±as proceeded to remove the black paint for the Teck Kee marker, though this proved to be less than a straightforward task as some of the red paint sat underneath the black paint. To effectively remove only the black pigments while retaining the red ones required many mechanical and chemical trials. After testing different types of solvents, the black pigments were removed successfully, and photographic evidence of the stone with the black paint was archived for future reference.
MaÃ±as's next step was to consolidate the fragile red pigments. She applied a consolidant to â€˜glue' the remains of the red paint to the stone so that they would not chip off. Similarly, this process is irreversible â€” once applied, the consolidant cannot be removed without compromising the red paint.
Another consideration during conservation is whether to restore certain original features if some of them are lost due to degradation. MaÃ±as explains the principle of restoration in conservation:
â€œGenerally, conservation does not involve repainting what is missing. However, if, say, 95 percent of the paint is still intact, conservators may carry out colour retouchingâ€”that is, to apply colour at the missing areasâ€”albeit using a material that is different from the original. But during this process of colour retouching, it is crucial to never alter the original paint, and this is a principle that is common across the restoration of paintings and objects.â€
In the case of the Teck Kee marker where more than 95 percent of the original red paint was lost, MaÃ±as did not perform colour retouching, thus leaving only fragments of the original red paint. Still visible to the naked eye, however, these fragments allow viewers to imagine what the boundary marker might have looked like back in the day with its bright-red engraved characters.
Permanent Home in the Museum

After conservation, the artefact is ready for its debut to the public with its refreshed lookâ€”now safely nestled in its permanent home, the museum, as part of the National Collection. An object of cultural importance, it will be preserved for time immemorial for future generations. Due to the material vulnerability of these historical objects, however, there are several considerations as to how they ought to be displayed in the museum for optimal preservation. These include environmental factors such as the humidity level and lighting, as well as the method of mounting and whether or not to encase the artefact.
For the Teck Kee marker, which is currently on display at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall1, MaÃ±as and the curators decided it was best to display it vertically and to have lighting angled from the side for better legibility of the engraved characters. Additionally, considering the fragility of the paint remains and to prevent further deterioration, the lighting level had to be dim, the humidity level set within the range of 55â€“65 percent, and the stone displayed within a showcase to prevent physical contact.
The intricate work on the markers has shown that, though largely invisible to the public eye, the work of conservators is a highly demanding one. It requires a â€œkeen understanding of material culture, and sensitive negotiation of the interconnection between an artefact['s] materiality and social relationship throughout its history, in order to enable both it and its significance to persistâ€2. If not for conservators, our cultural artefacts will be lost to time and irreparable damage â€” and what are we, as a society, without our heritage?

Benchmarks are all around us, though they are barely noticeable. Recently, one dating to the 1930s was discovered at the National Museum of Singapore building. The relic measures a mere two centimetres, but belying its size is an important function.

Image above: A bolt-style benchmark from the 1930s. The bolt head measuring two centimeteres in diameter is screwed into the middle of the square plate.
â€œThe cityâ€¦ does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls.â€
â€“ Italo Calvino1
The serendipitous discovery of two 19th-century granite boundary markers in October 2021 in Dover Forest stirred public interest in land histories and survey-related matters. Carefully extracted and accessioned into the National Collection to be preserved for posterity (see page 20 on the conservation process of the boundary markers), these two blocks of granite not only reveal the extent of landownership by two prominent merchants in colonial Singapore, but also historical methods of land survey.
A benchmark from the 1930s is located at the southeastern corner (circled) of the National Museum of Singapore main building.
After the two boundary markers were found, the National Heritage Board's (NHB) Heritage Research and Assessment Division embarked on a collaboration with the Singapore Land Authority's (SLA) Survey and Geomatics Division to document other historical survey markers. In March 2022, SLA's land surveyors, also known as geomatics engineers, brought a team from NHB to a familiar placeâ€”the National Museum of Singaporeâ€”to show them a survey marker that had been recently discovered.

Led to the southeastern corner of the front of the main museum building, the NHB team, expecting to see a marker like a hefty granite boundary marker, stood perplexed as the land surveyors pointed downwards to a portion of the wall where a layer of the painted concrete had been hacked. Framed by the rest of the intact wall and pebbles on the ground was a thoroughly unremarkable, very modestly sized squarish brownish patch sitting perpendicular to the ground. The NHB staff bent down to take a closer look: a square plate reddish-brown with rust was embedded into the wall, and screwed into the centre of the plate was a round bolt measuring a mere two centimetres in diameter. This bolt, the SLA team shared matter-of-factly, is a benchmark from the 1930s.
What is a Benchmark?
The highest point in Singapore is the summit of Bukit Timah. Arriving at the summit of the hill, one is greeted with a boulder bearing an inscription that states a height of 163.63 metresâ€”but what exactly does this mean and how was this measurement derived?
There are several ways to measure land elevation. The most accurate method is levelling whereby the elevation, or height, of a terrain is determined or verified in relation to a datum, which is usually the mean sea level.2 The elevation value that is obtained through this method would then be recorded in a survey markerâ€”a benchmark.
A levelling staff (centre) is placed on top of the benchmark, and the total elevation value is taken (right). To find out the elevation, or height, of another location (left), the elevation value of the benchmark is used as a point of reference.
Benchmarks come in a variety of designs and forms according to the period during which they were installed, but all of them perform the same function: each one serves as a stable reference point for determining the elevation of a nearby location. The earliest benchmarks were simply chiselled into vertical surfaces using the symbol of a broad arrow below a horizontal line. The middle of the horizontal line represents the height at that spot with reference to a particular datum. An angle-iron could be placed in the depression of the horizontal line to form a level surfaceâ€”known as a â€˜bench'â€”on which a levelling staff could be positioned accurately.

The benchmark at the National Museum takes the form of a single, round bolt, without any inscription, screwed into a square plate. Both the benchmark and the plate are probably made of cast-iron. The relic was discovered through SLA's archival records of historical elevation values that were at times accompanied by location sketches.
With a known elevation value, this benchmark can still be used to determine the elevation of a nearby terrain. To do this, a land surveyor would place a levelling staff at the top of the bolt and thus determine the elevation value of another location using the museum's benchmark as a point of reference.
One of the oldest existing benchmarks, likely etched in 1882, is found at the northern abutment of Cavenagh Bridge, which was built in 1869. Incidentally, this bridge is the oldest one across the Singapore River and was gazetted as a national monument in 2019. Despite its age, the Cavenagh Bridge benchmark is still in use today.
The oldest existing benchmark, dating to around 1882, at the northern abutment of Cavenagh Bridge. The benchmark is depicted by the traditional chiselled broad arrow with a horizontal line above. The middle of the horizontal line represents the height at that spot with reference to a particular datum.
Benchmarks are also shown on some maps, depicted using the arrow symbol or labelled â€˜B.M.', as well as in various British Admiralty charts of Singapore. The Cavenagh Bridge benchmark, for instance, is seen in an 18813 map and an 1893 map of Singapore.
History of Benchmarks and the Levelling System in Singapore
Singapore inherited the system of levelling and benchmark design from the British, who conducted their first precise levelling in the UK between 1840â€“60 in England and Wales using the mean sea level as the datum. Specifically, the mean sea level was obtained via tidal observations carried out at the Victoria Dock in Liverpool in 1844. The term â€˜benchmark' thus began to be used in the context of levelling.
In Singapore, the former Survey Department adopted the same survey technique, with the earliest tidal observations for land surveying purposes conducted by the then Public Works Department in 1882â€“83. This set of readings was taken at the Singapore River near the northern abutment of Cavenagh Bridge where the aforementioned benchmark is located.
The Survey Department was at the time just a stone's throw away, housed in the municipal building known later as Empress Place Building and now home to the Asian Civilisations Museum.
In 1937, however, the Survey Department adopted a datum based on tidal readings taken at Victoria Dock, which was located at what is known today as Keppel Habour in Tanjong Pagar. Originally known as the Survey Department Datum, it was renamed as the Singapore Height Datum in 2015â€”the official standard that is presently used by SLA.

To avoid confusion stemming from benchmarks based on different datums, which would result in inaccurate measurements, in 1958 the chief surveyor of Singapore established a precise levelling network covering the whole of Singapore based on the Survey Department Datum. This network comprised 68 â€˜precise level benchmarks' placed in the form of a closed loop around the main island. Subsequently, five more island-wide levelling exercises were conducted to densify and upgrade this infrastructure in 1977, 1983, 1987, 1994 and 2009. These benchmarks were all based on the Survey Department Datum.
Presently, there are approximately 450 precise level benchmarks maintained by SLA. They are installed along major roads across Singapore, each spaced about one kilometre apart. These modern benchmarks are simply a bolt set in concrete or stone, not unlike the benchmark at the National Museum dating to the 1930s, albeit with more identification information surrounding the modest bolt.

Historical Relics
In spite of Singapore's profound transformation since independence, a handful of benchmarks from the previous generations has survived. With the demolition of the former tide gauge at Victoria Dock in Tanjong Pagar in 1982, these historical benchmarks provide important links between historical datums used for precise levelling in Singapore over the last 140 years.
The benchmark at Cavenagh Bridge represents a datum from late-19th-century Straits Settlements. Significantly, it was used to mark the chart datum of the British Admiralty when they were conducting hydrographical surveys in Singapore waters. Hence, this benchmark points to a record of Singapore's historical sea level from around 1882.
On the other hand, the recently discovered National Museum benchmark from the early 1930s is a relic of the pan-Malayan land surveying system during the interwar years. Interestingly, there are two other benchmarks recorded to be at the National Museum building.4 The earliest is located near the entrance stairways to the building, as depicted in an 1893 map featuring the Raffles Library and Museum which occupied the building at the time. The second is on one of the pillars outside the building, recorded in a 1954 map. With the latest discovery of the benchmark from circa 1930s, the National Museum building is the â€˜most benchmarked' structure known in Singapore to date.
At the pump house of MacRitchie Reservoir lies another benchmark dating to 1960. This benchmark, based on the former Survey Department Datum, is still in use today for precise levelling. The top of the bolt is inscribed with its elevation value, which may also be purchased online via the SLA portal. Civil contractors use this data to determine the surface elevation of the area.

Modern-day Relevance of Benchmarks
As Singapore and the world confront the climate crisis, rising sea levels due to global warming pose a major threat to Singapore's survival, being a low-lying island-state. Thirty percent of Singapore is less than five metres above the Singapore Height Datum, which means that any increase in sea level could spell disasterâ€”coastal land may very well be swallowed by the sea.
The precise level benchmarks spread across the island today allow authorities to form a detailed terrain map used to assess the impact of rising sea levels on critical infrastructure. Low-lying areas that are more vulnerable to a rise in sea level may be raised, while other potentially risky areas may require mitigation strategies for localised flash floods.

Benchmarks also serve another significant function: a well-distributed and accurately surveyed precise levelling network ensures the safety of a wide range of engineering projects, both above and underground. These include the construction of expressways, train tunnels and airport terminals, among others.
Often unnoticed, unseen, benchmarks are visually unspectacular objects that are embedded in our everyday vernacular environment.5 But belying their nondescript appearance and modest size, they, too, have a story to tell and serve a very important function as Singapore continues to transform and adapt its land use according to market conditions, government policies and the climate crisis. We simply need to pay attention to our surroundings as the city reveals its layers to us with all its marks and traces.

Place heritage is not just about the built environment, but it also includes the intangible aspectsâ€”communities, ways of life, the natural ecology. All of us have a role to play as we collectively take on the stewardship of place heritage.
MUSE SG Volume 15 Issue 02 - July 2022
Text by Dr Johannes Widodo, Associate Professor, National University of Singapore

The city is a collective memory, a result of the contributions of all of its inhabitants accumulated over time.1 Place names, tangible features such as natural elements and architecture, and intangible aspects like history, events and communitiesâ€”all of these form one's sense of place. On another, more personal level, we as the city's inhabitants ascribe meaning to a place with our memories of it. As such, decisions to keep or change a place, or even erase it, bear significant consequencesâ€”affecting one's sense of place and attachment to the locale.
Place Heritage: Beyond the Tangible

Place heritage traditionally referred to buildings and sites, while heritage properties were mainly associated with monuments and buildings, without any relationship to their surrounding landscape.2 Today, the meaning of place heritage has been expanded to include the interaction between tangible and intangible aspects rooted in the cultural landscape, referring to a symbiosis of human activity and the environment.
Place heritage conservation therefore protects and upholds a set of values that the community has maintained for decadesâ€”historical, architectural, social, cultural, timelessness, economic and contextual.3 Part of it is retaining the â€˜authenticity' of a place, which helps people understand themselves and their place in society as a whole. In the process of place conservation, people collectively figure out what identity is, what a sense of belonging means, and recognise them. The authenticity of a locale's heritage is thus one of the most crucial factors in considering how everyone, including residents and visitors, can develop a genuine appreciation and attachment to a place from the past through to the present for the benefit of future generations.

Established in 1925, Red House Bakery closed in 2003. Today, the refurbished shophouse is home to micro red | house, a modern bakery serving up sourdough loaves.
Safeguarding Singapore's Place Heritage
The priority of Singapore from its independence in 1965 to 1989 was economic development and housing. In those decades, the city-centre was radically transformed from a slum and squatter zone into a modern financial and business hub. However, understanding the importance of place heritage amid the need for development, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) launched its Conservation Plan in 1989, which focused on physical conservation and city rebranding efforts.4 Conservation policies and guidelines at the time were inclined towards the conservation of the country's multi-ethnic and colonial built heritage.

Under the Conservation Plan, conservation status was granted to historic districts like Chinatown, Little India, Kampong Gelam and areas surrounding the Singapore River. Later, secondary settlements such as Joo Chiat and Geylang were also granted conservation status. While the conservation policy was geared towards protecting built heritage to preserve a distinctly â€˜local' flavour that would resonate with the people, a component of it was to drive tourism numbers.
URA adopted a stylistic classification for shophouse architecture for various conservation areas such as Chinatown, Kampong Gelam and Little India.5 This classification is defined according to linear periodisation, with meticulous stylistic descriptions of the architectural features: Early Shophouse Style (1840â€“1900), First Transitional Shophouse Style (early 1900s), Late Shophouse Style (1900â€“40), Second Transitional Shophouse Style (late 1930s) and Art Deco Shophouse Style (1930â€“60).
According to URA's conservation guidelines, the facades of shophouses are to be retained as a priority, with some flexibility in the building's interior to support adaptive reuse. Conserving the facades of old shophouses helped create a visual identity for these places, which were in turn also rebranded accordingly as â€˜Little India' and â€˜Chinatown' to impress upon tourists the identity of these historic areas.

Alongside the conservation work of URA was the former Preservation of Monuments Board, known today as the Preservation of Sites and Monuments (PSM), under the National Heritage Board. URA's mandate is to carry out conservation albeit allowing modifications to accommodate development, while PSM is the national preservation authority whose mandate is to identify structures and places of national significance and gazette these for preservation as national monuments. One of its functions is to ensure the full authenticity of the preserved buildings and sites.6
Due to the focus on the conservation and preservation of built heritage from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, little attention was paid to preserving existing communities, their ways of life or the sociocultural fabric. Thus, much intangible heritage was lost in those decades due to gentifrication as old businesses were driven out by market forces and communities relocated due to development. But this was to change in the new millennium, when a more holistic manner of conservation became the overarching framework.
The Urban Redevelopment Authority's stylistic classification for shophouse architecture in the conservation area of Little India:
Early Shophouse Style (60 Buffalo Street)
First Transitional Shophouse Style (39 Campbell Lane)
Late Shophouse Style (47 Desker Road)
Art Deco Shophouse Style (35 Cuff Road)
Holistic Conservation
Changes in the political climate and public aspirations saw the government gradually shift from a top-down approach to a more participatory strategy for urban conservation in the early 2000s. This was partly to nurture Singaporeans' sense of ownership and stewardship of the city's architectural and place legacy. The public desired a more inclusive framework for conservation, where a balance could be struck between conservation and redevelopment. Government policy increasingly moved towards holistic conservationâ€”an integrated, synergistic approach beyond physical structures to include communities and activities that contribute to a locale.
From August 2000 to May 2001, URA held public consultations in the urban planning process for the Concept Plan 2001.7 Ideas and contributions from the public were gathered through public forums, exhibitions and dialogues before the Concept Plan was finalised at the end of 2001. A similar process was implemented in the following year when the Master Plan 2003 was being drafted. Specifically, the Ministry of National Development appointed three subject groups comprising professionals, representatives from interest organisations and laypeople to study proposals relating to: (1) Parks and Waterbodies Plans and Rustic Coast, (2) Urban Villages and Southern Ridges and Hillside Villages, and (3) Old World Charm. The ideas and recommendations were incorporated in the draft of the Master Plan 2003.

No longer were policymakers focused solely on built heritage; communities, trades, traditions and activities could all contribute to the â€˜old-world charm' of a place. Such a holistic conservation approach thus includes modern and less aesthetically significant structures. The framework is multidimensional, encompassing buildings, traffic patterns, streetscapes, open spaces, and views. Holistic conservation therefore necessitates multidisciplinary participation at both local and national levels, and it involves all conservation stakeholdersâ€”users, owners, heritage supporters and decision-makers.
Voices from the Ground: Heritage and Nature Advocacy
An impetus for the above-mentioned policy changes can be attributed to the active engagement with government bodies by heritage societies. The Singapore Heritage Society was established in 1986 as a non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving, transmitting and promoting Singapore's history, legacy and identity.8 The society advocated for the future use of the former KTMB (Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad) Rail Corridor and the Bukit Brown Cemetery, working together with the Nature Society (Singapore).
The Nature Society (Singapore) has a history that stretches back to 1921, and it is presently a nongovernmental organisation that promotes nature appreciation, the conservation of natural resources, and engagement in local, regional and global initiatives to preserve biodiversity.9 Its advocacy work has seen success in the now-conserved Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve and Chek Jawa in Pulau Ubin. In 2015, the Nature Society and the Singapore Heritage Society collaborated on Green Rail Corridor: A Guide to the Ecology and Heritage of the Former Railway Landâ€”a comprehensive map of the former rail corridor that explores its diverse ecology and cultural heritage.

Heritage advocates based online, particularly on social media, have also mushroomed organically within the last decade in Singapore. Today, we have social media groups and other online communities made up of individuals with a shared interest in place heritage: Facebook groups Tiong Bahru Heritage Trails10 and Heritage Singapore â€“ Bukit Brown Cemetery;11 blogs â€˜Bukit Brown: Living Museum of History and Heritage'12 and â€˜All Things Bukit Brown: Heritage, Habitat, History';13 websites The Green Corridor,14 Wild Singapore15 and Singapura Stories;16 and many more.
In 2014, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) Singapore was founded as a non-governmental organisation consisting of professional heritage practitioners who have worked closely on public and private projects pertaining to Singapore's heritage sites. ICOMOS is an advisory body to UNESCO which actively contributes to the implementation of the World Heritage Convention.
A more recent addition to the ground-up heritage landscape is the non-profit group Documentation and Conservation of Buildings, Sites and Neighbourhoods of Modern Movement, or Docomomo Singapore, established in 2021.18 Docomomo Singapore aims to create awareness among Singaporeans on the nation's modern built heritage. Besides research and advocacy work, it also works with partners to find creative, sustainable and inclusive ways to conserve and retrofit the modern built heritage of Singapore.
Social media's influence on the increasing interest in heritage and sense of belonging among the younger generation cannot be underestimated. It will continue to be an essential platform of engagement that can change people's perception of and their attachment to heritage places. Needless to say, the proliferation of heritage groups online and offline has greatly increased community involvement in heritage-related issues, contributing to a stronger shared ownership of Singapore's place heritage.
A Shared Responsibility
Although the National Heritage Board is the official custodian of Singapore's heritage, non- governmental organisations and other community movements are crucial in the stewardship of Singapore's heritage. It is the responsibility of everyone to preserve and celebrate the shared heritage of our diverse communities, as the integrity of the tangible and intangible heritage entrusted to us by past generations depends on us.

Under our generation's stewardship, it may be destroyed, damaged, altered or abused; on the other hand, it may also be restored, repaired, maintained, conserved or preserved. Conserving our natural and cultural legacies is an act of managing changes, extending the past to the present and the future for the current and subsequent generationsâ€”and this requires the active involvement of everyone, not only the government.
The importance of the retention of identities through the preservation and conservation of natural and cultural heritageâ€”especially place heritageâ€”will become even more crucial as the development and redevelopment of our urban areas continually expand outwards to cater to the needs of a larger population and economic growth. But we must never forget that we need to preserve the people's memories, identities and sense of place for future generations. Heritage conservation is, after all, about the people.

Watch: Meet Senior Curator Noorashikin Zulkifli 

Noorashikin Zulkifli, a veteran curator with the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) specialising in Islamic art, has been with the National Heritage Board (NHB) for more than a decade. Involved in numerous exhibitions and programmes throughout her career with various cultural institutions Noora most recently worked on the pop-up exhibition Apa Khabair? - Peranakan Museum in the Making held at ACM. 
Noora, please tell us about your path towards becoming a curator at a national heritage institution!
I'd never imagined where I would be now in terms of my career â€” looking back, it was a meandering journey with different stops along the way. I have always been interested in the arts, even back in school. My first interest was theatre. After junior college, I did not attend university right away but got involved in local theatre groups such as The Necessary Stage and Teater Ekamatra in both onstage and offstage capacities. As an 18-year-old then, these experiences were very exciting.
That sparked my interest in arts management, which I took up in university, and it was then I discovered my next love: modern contemporary art. Thus, I pursued a master's degree in interactive media and critical theory at Goldsmiths, University of London. After I returned to Singapore, I wondered if I wanted to practise as an artist; yet I was also interested in putting together a production.
I had the opportunity to join the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) as a programmer after my studies and that gave me the opportunity to put on spectacular live events, as well as understand how curating and programming complement each other. SAM was also where I tried my hand in curating for the first time. It was an eye-opening experience working with such a huge gallery, dealing with artists, and building an art exhibition. After SAM, I taught media theory at LASALLE College of the Arts for three years.

A turning point arrived when I was engaged as a researcher to work on the revamp of MHC in 2009. The work made me reflect on various historical subjects, as the questions and issues that were being addressed for the project necessitated greater examination and a deeper look into the past. I joined MHC officially the following year as a curator and worked there until 2015.
One of the things I experimented with at MHC was community co-creationâ€” setting up â€˜clinics' with community groups to discuss exhibition-making. I adopted this co-creation model for the Se-Nusantara series at MHC that highlighted different ethnic groups. It aimed to provide communities with the space to have their own voice. It was a truly enjoyable process; it challenged what I thought I or they knew, but I realised in the end that it's really all about listening.
After these â€˜detours', I joined ACM as a curator in 2015 while it was undergoing a revamp and worked on the Islamic art gallery.
What have you learnt from working on artefacts at ACM?
I came to appreciate how details of an object can be used to draw out rich stories, and I also became more acquainted with a variety of media and materials. Having the privilege of touching objects that have lasted, say, 500 years, made by people during that time â€” that never ceases to amaze me. That someone living in an environment with far less technology than we have today, was able to rely on their own skills without computer-aided design, and yet could execute intricate details so masterfully â€” it blows my mind!

I was also exposed to other aspects of curation that were less â€˜public-facing'â€” collection acquisition and development, which I found to be very meaningful.
Humans forget and our memory is fallible. Having the National Collection as a repository of works preserved from centuries ago is an incredible resource to rediscover techniques or knowhow, as well as to rediscover peoples and their stories.
Can you share with us an artefact that has left a lasting impression on you?
A calligraphic tile from the 13th century. The brilliant metallic hues that can be achieved are amazing to behold, especially in terms of how a variety of shades can be seen depending on how light hits the surface. Considering the difference in scientific knowledge and methods between now and then, I'm amazed at how the artist(s) figured out what compounds or elements to use and the innovation it took to create such a beautiful effect.
Given how long it takes to throw, mould, decorate and fire a piece of ceramic, it must have been quite a long road in terms of experimentationâ€” imagine the amount of patience, focus and dedication required!
Calligraphic tile. Iran, Kashan, 13th century Glazed fritware 1996-00190. One of the major innovations of Islamic art is the advancement of lustre painting. The technique involves the application of metallic glazes on fired surfaces. The objects are then fired a second time to produce a shiny metallic veneer over the existing glaze. It appeared on glassware in Syria and Egypt from the seventh to the ninth centuries before being applied to ceramics, initially by Egyptian potters. It reached new heights in Syria and Iran, particularly in Kashan
In your relatively long career spanning many different institutions, what changes have you perceived in terms of public consciousness relating to heritage and history?
Since my time at MHC, there is now a much greater public appreciation for heritage. At MHC, we relied a lot on the community coming forward with their stories, but sometimes they didn't, not because they didn't want to, but because they didn't know what they had.
However, that is changing. People now have a better understanding that these stories are valuable and meaningful not only to themselves but also to other people, and that sharing them publicly can be a good thing. People are more invested in their identities and cultural heritage. They realise they can take ownership of their past, and this development has been very heartening and encouraging. Hopefully the interest continues to grow.
Although NHB is the official custodian of our heritage, it shouldn't be just us; everyone needs to play a part in it. We can't cover every story. The only story you can take control of is your own.
Expanding on what you said about people taking ownership of their own stories, how do you view the role of exhibitions today in terms of plurality of voices?
In the first place, an exhibition should never be an end point â€” but the start of a journey. Ideally, people should go to exhibitions and be inspired to embark on their own journeys of exploration. This process of discovery doesn't end in the gallery.
For me, museums are incubators, forums and facilitators. We focus on the larger sweeps of art history. These are frameworks for people to situate, make sense of, or place their own personal histories. From time to time, we have the opportunity to highlight these histories. Museums ought to be a resource in that way, but not an encyclopedia.
A shift that is occurring in the cultural sector not just locally, but globally, is that it is all about relationships and engagement. I am not wedded to the idea of the museum or any institution being the â€˜supreme' authority. I believe in pluralityâ€”and that is my ideal vision of the world. Museums are just one estate. There are things that museums do well, such as having the resources to conserve materials. But ultimately, we need to recognise that museums are only one of the players among many others.
â€œAlthough [the National Heritage Board] is the official custodian of our heritage , it shouldn't be just us; everyone needs to play a part in it. We can't cover every story. The only story you can take control of is your own.â€
What is the greatest lesson for you in terms of your career path?
Right now, the perception of a curator is still very rooted in being an academic. But I would like to make the point that there isn't just a single path. I have learnt so many skills through the roles I've played in various points of my life and in different settings.
In theatre, for example, one is trained in storytelling and scene-setting, and these are skills that are transferable to other kinds of work, such as exhibition-making. Also, I marry my contemporary art sensibilities with traditional art and historical objects, turning up new ways of seeing and contextualising. There are so many different pathways!
Don't just limit yourself to one thing. Instead, seek to adopt a multidisciplinary thinking. When I was in theatre, improvisational games were often part of practice and rehearsals â€” being exposed to these experiences helped me become more agile in my perspective. I am not so upset if things do not go according to plan. We need to think laterally and have multiple solutions.
From being involved in small, independent collectives and projects in my younger years to a national institution now, there is still some of the DIY (do-it-yourself) spirit in me. For example, I don't get too fussed about who needs to be doing what, in terms of the hierarchy of roles. We just do what needs to be done to make something happen â€” including an exhibition. That, for me, is what I value. Like, I would not be averse to sweeping the floor!

The National Collection is not just a random assortment of objects and artworks. It is a lens through which Singaporeans can better understand our shared cultural heritage.
MUSE SG January 2023

Objects and artworks can hold the collective memories of a nation. These material and cultural legacies in turn provide a window into the â€˜soul' of a nation, revealing the origins and identities of its people, and the nature of its society at any given point in time. This is why the National Collection exists: to connect both present and future generations of Singaporeans to their past. It is both a reminder of our roots and shared heritage, as well as how society in Singapore has evolved over time.

The National Heritage Board (NHB) is the custodian of this sizable public collection, which today comprises over 250,000 objects and artworks. At any one time, thousands of pieces are on public display at various museums and heritage institutions, with many more being studied and cared for at the Heritage Conservation Centre. As the steward of Singapore's heritage and culture, NHB works closely with various entities in the local arts and culture ecosystem to develop, interpret and care for the National Collection.
Why a National Collection?
The genesis of the National Collection can be traced to the early 19th century when Stamford Raffles established the Raffles Library and Museum. The eponymous Raffles Collection comprised books and manuscripts; natural history specimens and a zoological collection; as well as ethnological and cultural materials. After the formation of NHB in 1993, the ethnological and cultural materials in this collection were transferred to NHB, while the first two categories of objects were transferred to the National Library Board and the National University of Singapore respectively.
In a 1988 report by the Advisory Council on Culture and the Artsâ€”which proposed the establishment of a National Heritage Trust (the precursor of today's NHB)â€”several recommendations were made with respect to a national collection.
Muhammad Noor Aliff Bin Ghani, Assistant Director (Collections & Exhibitions), Heritage Institutions, and his team look after the collections and exhibitions at the three heritage institutions: Indian Heritage Centre, Malay Heritage Centre and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall. The physical care of artefacts through regular gallery maintenance works is paramount in ensuring their longevity. A visitor walking through the Indian Heritage Centre's permanent galleries will be greeted by an elaborate 19th-century tiled facade from Multan in Pakistan. Composed of 160 tiles, each of which is unique in shape and design, erecting the monumental facade was a laborious process that required precise mounting work.
As the facade is on open display, it is subject to dust and deterioration over time. Conservators and art handlers have to meticulously dust and clean each tile regularly to prevent the accumulation of dirt.

In-gallery maintenance of the National Collection is crucial as preventive care is always better than interventive conservation. Regular inspections of the artefacts allow for any issues to be addressed immediately.
First, at least five national museums as well as better storage and conservation facilities would be established. Second, the government would strengthen heritage collection at a national level, whether by acquisition through public funds or by encouraging private collectors and corporations to donate. Third, the government would maintain an updated inventory of heritage resources. These functions were included in the National Heritage Board Act 1993, which lays out the board's statutory duties in relation to the acquisition, safeguarding and disposal of Singapore's National Collection.
Overseas institutions adopt different approaches towards collecting objects and artworks of historical, cultural and artistic merit. The privately owned and operated Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, for instance, acquire and care for their own collections.
Singapore, on the other hand, has acquired and consolidated the National Collection through NHB's network of eight national museums and heritage institutions, also referred to as the Collecting Institutions. These institutions actively collaborate with 63 private and public museums that are part of the Museum Roundtable.1 This approach ensures that Singapore's material heritage is both protected and developed without imposing unnecessary restrictions on the private art market or being subject to the changing tastes and expectations of the public.

Today, the eight Collecting Institutionsâ€”Asian Civilisations Museum, Peranakan Museum, National Museum of Singapore, National Gallery Singapore, Singapore Art Museum, Indian Heritage Centre, Malay Heritage Centre and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hallâ€”continue to build the National Collection by identifying and acquiring objects and artworks that bear significance to Singapore's history and the identity of its people.
The National Collection Strategy
Six broad principles underpin the development of the National Collection. Fundamentally, the collection reflects and represents the cultural history of Singapore. It also locates and explains Singapore's place in Southeast Asia, Asia and globally. Moreover, every object and artwork that enters the National Collection must possess artistic, social, cultural, political, historiographical and/or geographical significance. At the same time, the collection supports the study and research of subjects relating to Singapore's heritage.
The collection is coordinated across the Collecting Institutions, and it is accessible to all Singapore museums for display, research and programmes. Finally, the National Collection aims to not just resonate locally, but also be recognised globally.
As multiculturalism is a core tenet of Singapore society, the Collecting Institutions identify and acquire objects and artworks that reflect Singapore's rich material heritage. While each institution has its own focus areas, they also collectively contribute to a comprehensive and diverse National Collection.

The Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) is a good example of this. As the only museum in Asia with a pan-Asian scope, it is devoted to exploring the many historical connections and intersections between cultures and civilisations in Asia, and between Asia and the world. A visit to ACM can provide encounters ranging from the ritual objects of early Arab civilisations to Chinese ceramics exported to European markets, and even contemporary objects inspired by heritage crafts and practices.

The histories of the movement of people, ideas and objects through and to Singapore are also explored at our heritage institutions, which dive deep into various diasporas in the country. Through close engagement with community stakeholders, heritage institutions tell the multifarious stories of Singapore's many ethnic sub-communities, adding nuance and texture to the Chinese-Malay-Indian and-Others administrative framework.
As the nation's oldest museum, the National Museum of Singapore traces the country's history from the 13th century to the present. Beyond collecting and displaying archaeological and historical artefacts, it focuses on presenting narratives of life in contemporary Singapore. In 2020, the museum launched the Collecting Contemporary Singapore initiative, which seeks to document contemporary events and developments in Singapore by broadening its collecting efforts to include artefacts from recent history and even the present-day. As this initiative is largely based on public engagement, the museum is better able to strengthen its position as a â€˜people's museum'.

The nation's foremost visual arts museums, the National Gallery Singapore and the Singapore Art Museum, collect works that highlight Singapore's art historical development. These include pioneer and practising Singaporean visual artists, as well as art historical periods from the pre-colonial to the contemporary. Particularly in the visual arts, both museums have a role to play in promoting emerging artists and experimental artistic practices, even if their artistic value may be uncertain in the early stages. Collecting Institutions thus invest in the future by creating space for exploration and experimentation so that young artists can test their ideas as they develop their oeuvre.
While artworks in the National Collection are predominantly of Singaporean and Southeast Asian origins, it does not preclude the museums from showcasing international artists. In fact, international exhibitions featuring high-profile names and collections often enable deeper curatorial and research explorations of objects in the National Collection, strengthening the subject of art history as a whole, and decentring it from Euro-American-centrism.
Over the years, NHB has amassed several significant collections, including the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, the Tang Shipwreck Collection, and numerous ink paintings by artist Wu Guanzhongâ€”displayed at the National Museum, ACM, and the National Gallery Singapore respectively. The National Collection's diversity enables museums to continually present new curatorial perspectives, create new knowledge, and connect with audiences both old and new.

For Ng Wan Gui, Senior Assistant Director (Collections, Exhibitions & Estates), Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), being able to bring Singapore's National Collection to overseas audiences brings her tremendous joy and a great sense of pride. In 2017, ACM co-organised Secrets of the Sea: A Tang Shipwreck and Early Trade in Asia with Asia Society, New York. This marked the first time objects from the Tang Shipwreck Collection were presented to an American audience. The Tang Shipwreck Collection,2 which is one of the highlights of Singapore's National Collection, demonstrates the dynamic economic activities along the Maritime Silk Route in the ninth century. While the collection occupies permanent pride of place at the ground-floor galleries of ACM, the shipwreck artefacts have also travelled around the world for various exhibitions, most recently the ACM and Shanghai Museum's collaboration on The Baoli Era: Treasures from the Tang Shipwreck in September 2020.
The National Collection presents many opportunities for partnership with international organisations to further study and research. Conservation scientist Lynn Chua at the Heritage Conservation Centre, for instance, is presently involved in a research project involving ancient craftsmanship of Changsha kiln painted porcelain bowls. Using microscopy and elemental analysis, Lynn and her collaborators discovered that the coloured decorations on the Changsha kiln bowls were in fact created using an overglaze technique (ie, colour painted over a transparent glaze before firing), countering the long-held view that the Changsha kiln had pioneered the underglaze technique. Such scientific research on the National Collection complements and deepens curatorial interpretation and knowledge of Singapore's cultural heritage.
The National Collection as a Public Good
The National Collection, which is held in public trust, forms the foundation of Singapore's material heritage and showcases the evolution of the nation's cultural and social practices as well as its national identity. The national museums are not mere receptacles of objects and artworks; in consultation with the public, the museums seek to make and remake narratives that define the Singaporean identity through thematic displays and special exhibitions.
NHB's partnership with schools has also led to the incorporation of the National Collection in the curriculum. Through a structured museum-based learning programme, lessons now extend beyond the classroom. The value of actually seeing a physical object or artwork that is first encountered within the pages of a textbook cannot be overstated. Indeed, history comes alive when viewing historical artefacts and imagining how they may have been used by our forebears.
This is why NHB maintains an extensive digital database of the collection. Today, everyone can visit NHB's heritage resource portal, Roots.gov.sg, to discover and learn about the National Collection and even request in-person viewings if necessary.
Images above: Buddhist artists' manual. 19 th century. Nepal. Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
This 19th-century Nepalese manual for iconometry (the measurement of religious icons and their proportions) was one of the first objects that Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) curator Conan Cheong acquired in his work for the National Collection in December 2016. It is believed that metal craftsmen from the Buddhist Newari ethnic group of Nepal's Kathmandu Valley consulted the manual to make images of Buddha. Annotated diagrams indicate the standard proportions that large, multipart figures from Buddhist iconography must adhere to for ritual efficacy.
Just before the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019, Conan began collaborating with a scholar of the Newari language to translate the manual's Newari inscriptions into English. Newari is an endangered language used by the indigenous people of Kathmandu Valley. Translation of the manual will grant insights into how artisans interpreted and used the manual to create these images.
Currently displayed in ACM's Ancient Religions Gallery, the manual is a fascinating piece that provides insight into the practice of Buddhism in Nepal.
  Caring for the National Collection
Everything that we know ofâ€”the National Collection includedâ€”is subject to the natural process of decay and degeneration. The management and care of the collection is, unsurprisingly, a significant undertaking.
Much of the work is carried out at the Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC), established in 2000 as a purpose-built facility for the storage and conservation of the National Collection. Besides maintaining an optimal environment for the long-term storage of objects and artworks, HCC also houses conservation laboratories for the treatment of object, painting and textile artefacts; a laboratory that supports scientific analysis, material testing and research; and a photography studio to digitise artefacts.
Painted Chinese silk robe for the European market. 1770s. China and Europe. Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Chuance Chen, Conservator (Textiles), Heritage Conservation Centre, fondly refers to this painted silk dress as â€˜Cordelia'. Chuance's interest in this garment was first piqued when he was completing his master's degree in textile conservation, which happened to coincide with the Asian Civilisations Museum's acquisition of Cordelia.
Even though Chuance's postgraduate research sent him on a deep dive into the study of painted textiles, the actual work of conserving Cordelia turned out to be a huge challenge for him. There are no textbook answers when it comes to conserving textiles because every treatment has to be specifically formulated for the specific piece being restored.
While working on the conservation of Cordelia, Chuance realised the creativity and immense historic value of the garment. At times, he felt as if the weight of the material legacy of humanity was literally in his hands.
Every conservator undergoes rigorous training and often specialises in treating a particular materialâ€”objects, paintings, textiles, paper. Within each domain, there ay also be further division. For example, object conservation refers to a wide range of organic and inorganic materials, including stone, wood, metal, plastics, glass, ceramics and animal products such as feathers and leather. Increasingly, as museums explore new collection areas and materials, for example, time-based media, conservators may face different challenges and have to continually reskill themselves with the latest conservation techniques to care for the growing National Collection.
Conservators generally do not strive to return the objects they work on to their original states which are often unknown; instead, they seek to present objects in ways that are best representative of their biography, function and intent. Objects are always treated with posterity in mind to safeguard the National Collection as a legacy for future generations of Singaporeans. One can consider the National Collection as a material bridge across generations: evidence that our existence can be traced through time.

For Regina Liew, Assistant Conservator (Paintings), Heritage Conservation Centre, every project presents new challenges and new opportunities for learning. When formulating the most appropriate conservation treatments, she considers not just the paint media or the condition of the artwork, but also the artist's intent and the artwork's biography.
Regina recalled an occasion when she met with the grandchildren of Malaysian artist Yong Mun Sen. They shared that, during the Second World War, their grandfather had to fold and bury his unmounted paintings in a hill to keep them safe from Japanese soldiers. For Regina, this was an illuminating moment: here was a plausible reason for the fold lines she had observed on the works and what would otherwise have been classified as â€˜damage' took on new meaning. Details such as these could potentially inform the decisions she makes as a conservator and the interpretation of the work that curators present to visitors.
When Regina first encountered George Groslier's Le Brahmanisme, she noticed the flaking paint and some material losses across the canvas because the painting had been rolled up and stored for a long time. Together with her team, Regina spent countless hours studying the painting and related information on the artist and his work. She consolidated the flaking paint layer and stretched the painting out on a new stretcher, cleaning and flattening fold lines before in-filling areas of loss.
Conservators navigate a fine balance between principles of conservationâ€”any conservation work done has to be visible and also reversibleâ€”and the aesthetic. More importantly, any treatment done to artworks must not be out of place or jarring in the eyes of the viewer.
  In addition to keeping abreast of the latest research, materials and practices in conservation, NHB's conservators seek to make new breakthroughs in the field of conservation science. For example, Esther Ng, Senior Paper Conservator at HCC, was the first person in Singapore (and possibly the region) to explore microfadingâ€”a method of assessing the vulnerability of objects to light-fading. The feat unlocked new knowledge in terms of environmental display requirements to slow down deterioration, particularly for light-sensitive materials such as textile, paper and photographs. While nothing can last forever, cutting-edge conservation practices can help slow down the ageing process to ensure that the National Collection can be enjoyed and appreciated for just a bit longer.
Alongside conservators who safeguard the physical condition of the National Collection, museum curators assess the cultural and art historical significance of objects as well as flesh out accompanying narratives that might otherwise remain hidden. Meanwhile, collection managers are responsible for the physical care of artefacts, including storage, packing, transport, mounting and display. By working together, each specialist provides additional dimensions for interpreting and understanding artefacts, translating them into richer, more dynamic experiences for audiences.
The National Collection is not an inanimate repository of heritage materials. Instead, it is a nuanced and diverse repertoire of objects and artworks enlivened by interpretation and the daily contact of many hands involved in its care and display. But even so, the story does not end there: each individual item in the National Collection will go on to take new life and meaning through the pleasure and enjoyment it induces in its viewers.

The surviving books and manuscripts from the Malay World, particularly from the 14th century onwards, contain a captivating glimpse into the literary manifestation of cultural practices of the community. Beyond historical documentation, these literary treasures provide an insight particularly on topics such as magic, divination, and healing.

This article features a collection of selected manuscripts and rare books from our Singapore National Collection, including an in-depth view of one of the artefacts from the collection of the Malay Heritage Centre, the Jimat scroll. Together, these artefacts demonstrate the significance of magic and divination in the Malay world using religious scripture and illumination, and the ways in which science, cultural practice, and religious beliefs work together to endow objects with talismanic and protective powers.

The Influence of Islam and the Use of the Jawi Script
Malay works were traditionally experienced orally and aurally prior to and well after the adopting of manuscript practice, with early Malay manuscripts employing Indic scripts and lettering systems such as kawi , pallava and nigari . These early lettering systems were carved and inscribed on stones and palm leaves, and also engraved on monetary coins and jewellery. The arrival of Islam in the Malay Peninsula during the 12th to 13th century â€“ through religious scholars, pilgrims and also arguably through merchants and traders from India and the Persian Gulf â€“ had great influence on the existing literary tradition of the Malay world. The influence of Islam introduced the Arabic script, which was later adapted into what is known as the jawi script to include specific Malay words and phonemes.
Beyond introducing the jawi script and the culture of writing, Islam also heavily influenced the narratives that were written and shared with the community. Stories regarding key Islamic figures, such as those relating to Prophet Muhammad and his companions, and other tales relating to Islamic morals and ethics, were often localised for audiences in the archipelago.
This section showcases a series of selected literary works, all of varying content and function, that utilise the jawi script. Click here to explore other artefacts in our National Collection, from heritage objects to modern 20 th century textbooks, which feature the jawi script.

Divination Manuscripts in the Malay World
Manuscripts of the Malay world documented the blurred distinction that existed between magic and religion. Books on magic and divination, as with other respected texts and manuscripts, were referred to as kitabs and held in high regard as they were perceived to be part of the literary corpus of the religion.
One form of Malay manuscripts were manuals for divination and healing. These manuscripts contain many of the tools that â€œmagiciansâ€ used in carrying out their work, including incantations to recite, instructions for casting spells, methods to create talismans and endow them with protective powers, as well as charts, tables, and other techniques for fortune-telling and divination. There is also a close relationship with religion; Qur'anic texts and prayers were often included in these manuals and talismans, as they were believed to call on protective powers. These elements were reconciled with Islamic precepts and teachings, as it can be observed through how many of the incantations and talismans had involved the use of the Qur'an.
Malay â€œmagiciansâ€ were often engaged by members of their communities for the practice of divination. Such acts can be defined as attempts to predict future events or gain information about the â€œunseenâ€. Divination manuscripts may be used for various purposes including everyday practical concerns and tasks, such as determining what dates and timings are ideal for building houses or planting crops.
Although divination was a common practice in the region, divination manuscripts tend to differ from each other according to the magicians' preferences. Notes in their manuscripts tend to be specialised knowledge that may only be privy to the magician who owned or used them. Nonetheless, these manuscripts usually contained similar information on numerology, astrology, auspicious or inauspicious times, omens, dream interpretation, physiognomy, sortilege, and bibliomancy.
The talismanic inscriptions and designs present in these manuscripts were thought to contain great mystical power that may be utilised to affect the intended purpose of the user. The belief of divination manuscripts carrying the talismanic properties resulted in several types of divination manuals, one of which is in the form of a talismanic scroll. Talismanic scrolls were created or preferred by some practitioners as they were small and easy to transport.

This talismanic scroll, dating from around 1900, is believed to have been used to protect or benefit the owner or user. In Malay, these talismans are generally called azimat or jimat, although a protective amulet may also be referred to as a tangkal. An in-depth look at this jimat scroll is elaborated in the next section of the article.

The Protective Power of Talismans
Beyond divination manuals, the use of Qur'anic texts and verses were also evident in talismans, amulets and charms, which were also prevalent throughout the region. Small objects, most either carried or worn, were believed to be imbued with magical powers for various purposes such as protection, healing of ailments, and even attracting wealth or love interests. Their protective properties were said to be imbued by the bearing of Qur'anic inscriptions, as well as the use of names of prophets, and other imageries. Many Muslims prescribed to the idea that any object inscribed with the word or name of Allah or God will protect the owner or any individual who reads, touches, or dons the object. Thus, the individual would have the power to ward off evil by the protection of God.

The Jimat Scroll
Divination manuals in the Malay world include what is commonly called jimat scrolls â€“ talismanic scrolls believed to grant protection, healing or benefit through magic and sorcery. Small enough to be carried in one's pocket, a jimat scroll accords the owner the ability to use or recite the incantations with ease of accessibility and convenience. This section takes an in-depth look at a jimat scroll from the collection of the Malay Heritage Centre.

Jimat Scroll - Malay Manuscript

Collection of Malay Heritage Centre

As with other divination manuscripts and talismanic items, the surface of this jimat scroll is covered with prayers, signs, numbers, and decorative motifs on both the internal and external sides. Encased within a two-part wooden cover, this scroll shows signs of wear, with its dating estimated to be at the early 20th century.
Six buduh or magic squares â€“ grids that contain numbers and alphabets â€“ are inscribed across the scroll. In the Islamic tradition, these grids often contain the abjad letters ba (Ø¨), wau (Ùˆ), dal (Ø¯) and ha (Ø­) to form the word buduh. Variations of the buduh magic square in Malay manuscripts are catered to the needs of the user. Examples of day-to-day uses include providing protection for oneself, attracting customers to one's business, easing childbirth, easing ailments, ensuring safe passage of letters and packages, and protecting one's boats and during journeys and transportation. It is even used for divination purposes to determine suitable dates and timings for voyages and customary events.
Accompanying the texts are illuminations, such as frames containing scrolling foliage and floral patterns adorned with colours. These artistic features and decorative flourishes of the scroll shows a strong connection to aspects of Malay decorative and performing arts in the peninsula, such as woodwork and theatre.
Here are some close-up images of portions of the scroll, accompanied with selected Malay transliteration and explanations.
Transliteration: Inilah Mohor nubuwah pada pusat Rasullulah SAW. Barangsiapa melihat Mohor nubuwah itu pada pagi dan petang nescaya kasih kepadanya segala jinn dan segala manusia dan sementiasa ia dalam kesukaan jiwa dan tiada dapat seterusnya berbuat jahat kepadanya dimasukkan Allah Ta'ala ia ke dalam Syurga dengan tiada hisab Wallahua'lam.

Illuminations and Imageries
In general, Malay literary manuscripts lacked illuminations. However, selected manuscripts, such as devotional works of the Dala'il al kayrat of al-Jazuli and kitab maulid contained beautiful illustrations, more specifically stylized representations of the symbols of holy cities of Mecca and Medina. This is in accordance with Islamic art tradition, where figurative representations and depictions of living creatures are often excluded. Instead, geometric patterns and arabesque motifs are more prominently featured. Such decorations are typically found in title pages, although the more ornate manuscripts may have artistic features throughout the folio. The rectangular frames that bordered the texts may be embellished with arches and floral and foliage motifs in an intricate meandering pattern. Similar motifs can also be found in other Malay decorative arts, such as woodcarving, silverwork, embroidery, textiles, and sculptures.

The Making of Manuscripts â€“ Materials and Techniques
The materials and techniques used for the manuscripts often hint at their place of origin. Most extant manuscripts are only dated from the 17th century, as earlier works had degraded due to the humidity of the region. Manuscripts made from materials such as bark and bamboo were able to survive for longer. Some manuscripts were even inscribed in stone.
The paper used for manuscripts tend to be manufactured in Europe and brought over to the region, as there was limited paper-making tradition in the Malay archipelago. Italian paper was also brought over from the Middle East. For the text and writing, black ink was commonly used, while blue, red, and yellow inks were also used as decorative elements or to contrast certain texts against the black. In later manuscripts, watercolour was also used.
Most manuscripts were not bound, but are instead loose, or sewn together. Loose leaves were held together using pieces of cotton or leather covers, depending on the region. Other methods used to keep these manuscripts together were folding-book, which was mainly used in mainland Southeast Asia, or Islamic binding, which was inspired by manuscripts from other Muslim communities.

National Theatre
Address: River Valley Road, Fort Canning Park
  Designed to commemorate Singapore's attainment of self-government in 1959, the building of the National Theatre was funded substantially by public contributions until its completion in 1964. The open-air theatre, which could seat an audience of more than 3,400, became a popular venue for large-scale performances, concerts, conferences, university convocations and the annual National Day rallies (1966-1982). It was a much beloved destination for friends and family outings, many well-remembered with photographs of themselves with the iconic five-pointed frontage and the crescent-shaped bowl fountain. In film, the theatre was also a frequent backdrop for characters visiting from overseas, such as in Crazy Bumpkins in Singapore é˜¿ç‰›ä¸‹å—æ´‹ (1976), where local comedic double Wang Sha and Ye Feng, in their roles, lingered around the fountain to think of ways to feed a found baby. It had also served as a key location for films such as Kaseh Ibu (1965) and Ninaithale Inikkum (1979). The theatre was demolished in 1986 after it was deemed structurally unsafe.

Former Satay Club
Address: Connaught Drive, Esplanade
The former Satay Club at the Esplanade was named after one of Singapore's favourite dishes â€˜satay' â€“ sticks of grilled skewered meat served with spicy peanut sauce. This hawker establishment had roots in a thoroughfare near the Alhambra and Marlborough cinemas along Beach Road in the late 1940s, before it was relocated to the Esplanade in 1971. Built as an open-air food centre, the Satay Club became a famous hotspot, with locals and tourists alike, to soak in the evening sea breeze while relishing the eponymous street food and other popular hawker dishes. Filming crews from Hong Kong and Taiwan also found the waterfront venue an attractive location for films with stories of travel, such as Crazy Bumpkins in Singapore é˜¿ç‰›ä¸‹å—æ´‹ (1976) and Where The Sea Gull Flies æµ·é¸¥é£žå¤„ (1974). Key scenes from local martial arts film Ring of Fury è¡€æŒ‡çŽ¯ (1973) were also shot there. The Satay Club closed in 1994 to make way for Esplanade Theatres on the Bay and the Nicoll Highway extension.

Siong Lim Temple (Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery èŽ²å±±åŒæž—å¯º)
Address: 184, Jalan Toa Payoh
The Siong Lim Temple is a Buddhist monastery founded in 1898 and built on the land of a Hokkien merchant, Low Kim Pong with the help of his father-in-law Yeo Poon Seng. The idea to build the temple was conceived after Low and his son both dreamed of a sacred man and meeting a group of monks and nuns led by Venerable Xian Hui, who became the monastery's founding abbot. Over the decades, the temple gained renown among local worshippers, pilgrims and travellers alike, and came to be listed regularly in guidebooks of Singapore. Numerous filmmakers also paid cinematic homage to the spiritually revered place. As early as 1925, German travel film The Flight Around the World , the first fiction feature to be partly shot on location in Singapore, showed many areas of the temple complex, capturing pre-WW2 images of the architecture before a major restoration in the 1950s; these included the entrance Hall of Heavenly Kings, where local comedic double Wang Sha and Ye Feng also performed for the film Crazy Bumpkins in Singapore (1976), in their roles as fortune-tellers.

Former Cathay Building
Address: Dhoby Ghaut
When completed in 1941, the Cathay Building was Singapore and Malaya's first-ever skyscraper, featuring sixteen storeys of luxurious suites, with a double-storey penthouse that was home to Loke Wan Tho, head of the Cathay Organisation which commissioned the building. Designed by architect Frank Brewer in the Art Deco style, the flagship at Dhoby Ghaut had under its roof the Cathay Cinema, Cathay Restaurant and Cathay Hotel (converted from the suites in 1954). The classic architecture and setting inspired many filmmakers from the 1950s to â€˜60s to locate part of their narratives in and around the skyscraper, including those of the Cathay-Keris studio, the local filmmaking arm of Cathay Organisation. In Rasa Sayang Eh (1959), as star performer Wahid Satay flies into Singapore, his flight passed over the skyscraper. A travelling magician-villain falls to his death from the roof of the building in Sumpitan Rachun (1961), as did Mat Sentol in Mat Bond (1967; a spoof spy film), who magically survives the fall and even does a flying-fox descent across its faÃ§ade. The Cathay Hotel, its lobby and rooms, also received a notable location cameo in French espionage thriller Five Ashore in Singapore (1967). Fast forward to 2006, after a major redevelopment of the aging building, it reopened as The Cathay.

Singapore Cable Car, Mount Faber
Address: 109 Mount Faber Road
Conceived in 1968 as part of a tourism masterplan the Singapore Cable Car finally opened in 1974 after years of development and testing and was an immediate hit with locals and visitors. The gondola lift system initially linked a station on Mount Faber (Singapore's second highest peak after Bukit Timah Hill, originally Telok Blangah Hill) with a single station on Sentosa, on a loop made up of 43 cabins that â€“ in those days â€“ had doors that had to manually opened at either end. The Cable Car first made its appearance in feature films when it was used as a means of escape, from some heavies, by superspy Cleo (Doris Yong) in They Call Herâ€¦ Cleopatra Wong in 1978. It was only logical that when Hawaii Five-O came to Singapore that same year that they would film a daring chase and fight scene on the Cable Car, probably modelled on a set-piece from On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), starring George Lazenby as James Bond, who incidentally played a bad guy in the same episode of Hawaii Five-O. Today the Cable Car still leaves from Mount Faber but now stops at Harbourfront and at three stations on Sentosa, and the doors open and close automatically.

Chinese Garden
Address: Boon Lay Way
  In the late 1960s Jurong Town Council made plans to repurpose a mangrove swamp along the Jurong river into Jurong Park, a green belt for civic use, which was finally opened to the public in 1975. The plan was to create set of contrasting and connected â€˜gardens' (now called Jurong Lake Gardens), with the Chinese Garden as the centrepiece. Designed by Yu Yuen-Chen, a Taiwanese architect, the Chinese Garden was intended to emulate northern Chinese Imperial gardens, including a Rainbow Bridge based on the arched bridge at the Summer Palace in Beijing. This bridge was first seen on film in They Call Herâ€¦ Cleopatra Wong in 1978 during a scene where superspy Cleo (Doris Yong) escapes from an army of villains. The year that film was released it was a key location in the Singapore episodes of Hawaii Five-O , when renegade American soldier Sandover (Barry Bostwick) is supposed to be reunited with his wife (Victoria Principle), a meeting disrupted by supercop Steve McGarrett (Jack Lord). No doubt both sets of filmmakers were attracted by the bridge's dramatic and picturesque arches, although it makes little sense for any of the characters to head this far to the west of Singapore!
Raffles Hotel
Address: Beach Road
While Raffles Hotel is one of Singapore's truly iconic buildings, what's less well-known is that by the time it appeared in movies in the 1960s it was past its prime. The Golden Era, of the 1920s and 30s (whenby it was visited by luminaries like Noel Coward and Somerset Maugham) was over for the Sarkies Brothers legendary hostelry. The hotel's charms had reportedly faded, and its crumbling entrance was under reconstruction when it was a key location for the British-American film Pretty Polly (1966), an adaptation of Noel Coward's Singapore-set novella and a star vehicle for Hayley Mills, nevertheless it maintained a timeless, colonial glamour. Over a decade later the lobby area is the meeting point for the two villains of the Singapore episodes of Hawaii Five-O , played by George Lazenby and Barry Bostwick, and that same year it would be used for scenes in Saint Jack , which show the Palm Court, a tiny elevator and one of the rooms. In the 1980s it was visited by David Bowie in the documentary Ricochet and was repurposed into the office of evil capitalist Nicoll Williamson in the TV movie Passion Flower . In 2018, after years of upgrading, reconstruction and having changed hands several times, it was a meeting point between the beautiful lovers of Crazy Rich Asians. Who knows which fictional characters will meet there next?

The night darkens and the crowd gathers. Placing themselves on either side of the lit screen (kelir), excitement buzzes as they wait eagerly for the shadow puppetry (wayang kulit) to begin. Behind the kelir, the puppeteer (dalang), gamelan orchestra and female singers (pesinden) prepare for the typically night-long performance. A note is played, a tune is sung, and the dalang's voice echoes into the night. The once-still puppets now awaken and their shadows enthral the audience as the story of good versus evil begins.

Welcome to Javanese Wayang Kulit Puppetry
Wayang kulit refers to shadow puppetry, a type of traditional theatre play, that is performed in Southeast Asia using two-dimensional puppets crafted from animal hide. In Java, this term also refers to the intricately handmade puppets. Beyond the purpose of entertainment, these performances are also used as a medium to transmit values, culture, religion and even comment on current affairs. These performances were also traditionally believed to provide spiritual protection over the audience.
Wayang kulit often follows the plot of good versus evil and storylines often retell or are inspired by the Hindu epics Ramayana or Mahabharata. In these stories, the puppets used are characters ranging from gods, nobles and priests to commoners, giants (raksasa), jokers (panakawan or punakawan) and animals.
We met Mr Tumadi Patri, a 63-year-old active batik artist practitioner of Javanese descent. Mr Tumadi has been exposed to Javanese wayang kulit since the age of 6. With almost 40 years of experience, Mr Tumadi continually reflects his experience by largely incorporating Javanese wayang kulit puppets in his artworks. Let's watch a short and simple demonstration by Mr Tumadi using Javanese wayang kulit puppets. Enjoy the colours of the puppets and props! Subtitles are not verbatim. 
  Join me, as we find out more about Javanese wayang kulit puppets and props specifically found in the Ramayana epic. View Javanese and other wayang kulit puppets and props in the Singapore National Collection by scrolling through the image carousel.
Gunungan
Gunungan, also known as kayon, is a key prop in wayang kulit. Representing the cosmic order of the universe, it is used to signal the opening, ending and transitions during a wayang kulit. The motifs seen across the gunungan, such as a palace, forest, fire and wind, can also be used to set the context during the scenes. To begin the wayang kulit, the gunungan is twirled from the centre and planted firmly at the right of the kelir.
Fun fact: The opening movement of the gunungan symbolises the entrance into the mystical world!
Watch the video below as Mr Tumadi shares about the gunungan.

The Good
Enter the main characters of the Ramayana epic â€“ Rama (the prince and successor to the throne), Dewi Sinta (Rama's wife) and Lesmana (Rama's brother). Protagonists in the epic, they are known to have high moral virtues such as loyalty, humbleness, wisdom and kindness. These virtues can be seen from their facial features and posture.
Fun fact: Each facial feature has different shapes that tells of the character's virtue on the spectrum of good versus evil.
View the images below for an example of the Good character's features.

The Allies
As good and evil battle it out, characters such as the vulture Jatayu (a Garuda bird), and wanara, monkeys that display human-like behaviours, play crucial roles to guide or aid the good characters to victory. One of the most famous wanara is Hanoman, also spelled Anoman, a general who had proven himself to be the strongest and most capable.
Fun fact: In the Ramayana epic, Jatayu fought hard and used his last breath to tell Rama and Lesmana that Dewi Sinta (Rama's wife) had been abducted by Rahwana, the evil and oppressive king.
Watch the video below as Mr Tumadi shares about Hanoman.

The Evil
A formidable opponent! With their big round eyes and bulging nose, these evil characters are no small feat. Raksasa, translated as giants, demons or ogres, are typically bigger in size to symbolise their physical force while their posture and facial features dictate their lack of self-control, aggression and impatience.
Fun fact: In the Ramayana epic, Wibisana, the brother of Rahwana, eventually defected to the side of the Good due to his moral sense of justice and disagreement over Rahwana's decisions.

The Jokers
  Bringing much laughter to the scenes and yet, also much wisdom, the jokers are characters that cannot go unmentioned when talking about Javanese wayang kulit. Also known as the clowns, or in Javanese â€“ panakawan or punakawan â€“ Semar and his sons, Gareng, Petruk and Bagong are interestingly not specifically mentioned in the Ramayana epic. However, so crucial and popular are they that the dalang will typically include them in a wayang kulit to break tension, bring laughter and comment on current affairs. Each of these odd-looking characters have their own quirks and peculiarities.

Props
Besides the gunungan, there are other props used to enhance the wayang kulit scenes. These other props typically have specific purposes and can range from animals, marching armies (rampogan, rampokan, or perampogan), to utilitarian objects such as tea jugs or magical objects and weapons. Some refer to all the props as ricikan while others use the term to refer to the smaller props like the weapons and utilitarian objects.
Fun fact: The figures depicted in the rampogan depends on the kingdom they belong to. For example, the Evil kingdom will depict ogres while Rama's kingdom will depict the wanara.

The Artist and His Handicrafts
Creating traditional wayang kulit puppets involves the cleaning and preparing of animal hide which are subsequently drawn, coloured, chiselled, assembled and varnished. While Mr Tumadi's expertise is in batik art, Javanese wayang kulit puppets are his go-to motifs for his batik artwork. Mr Tumadi also makes his own Javanese wayang kulit puppets.
Watch Mr Tumadi as he gives us a peek into his work of making wayang kulit puppets without animal hide, right here in Singapore!

The vision of Singapore as a Garden City was first conceptualised by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew in May 1967 that kickstarted the greening movement of Singapore in the 1970s. Many considered Mr Lee to be Singapore's chief gardener who was inspired by the tree-lined boulevards that he had come across overseas. An intensive tree-planting programme was launched by the Parks and Trees Division that saw more than 55,000 new trees planted across the island by the end of 1970. Many of the trees planted during the period are still standing tall today.
In 1976, the Parks and Recreation Department was set up to replace the Parks and Trees Division. The National Parks Board was subsequently established in 1990 and expanded in 1996 to take the lead in managing, developing and enhancing Singapore's parks, park connectors and roadside greenery. Today, Singapore is one of the greenest cities in the world. The lush urban greenery that we have is a result of sustained and dedicated efforts to green up Singapore over the past few decades. As we transform into a City in Nature, we will further restore nature into the urban environment and bring people closer to nature. 
An important pillar of the City in Nature vision, the OneMillionTrees movement aims to plant one million more trees across Singapore by 2030. Trees help to provide shade and reduce the urban heat island effect, providing a much-needed respite for city dwellers. They are also important carbon dioxide and are part of the solution to mitigate the effects of climate change. For urban fauna, trees increase the ecological connectivity between fragmented habitats, allowing animals to move from one green space to the other. 
This photo-essay will bring you through the Civic District to explore some of the majestic trees that have witnessed our city's progress over the years.

Rain Trees (Samanea saman)
Location: Istana main gate
Lofty Rain Trees outside the Istana greet visitors from all walks of life. 
The journey begins at the grand main gate of the Istana where a row of lofty Rain Trees graces the entrance. Planted in the 1970s at the request of the late Prime Minister Lee, these Rain Trees had the honour of welcoming the different Presidents of Singapore and greeting visitors to the Istana, from foreign delegates to members of the public. Rain Trees are generally fast-growing and can reach up to 25 m in height. Their umbrella-shaped crowns provide pleasant shade to passers-by along Edinburgh Road and serve as a green lung of the Orchard area.
Originally from tropical America, Rain Trees were first reportedly introduced into Singapore in 1876 and planted extensively along major roads, expressways and parks for their shade-providing benefits. In the evenings or before rainy weather, their small leaflets will fold up to direct the rain water straight into the soil. It is also this characteristic that gives this species the common names â€œRain Treeâ€ and â€œPukul Limaâ€ (which means 5 o'clock in Malay).
Angsana Trees (Pterocarpus indicus)
Location: School of the Arts
â€œThe Seedâ€ art sculpture now stands at where the original tree once was, welcoming students into the school's compound. 
On the steps of the School of the Arts (SOTA) once stood an iconic Angsana tree known as the SOTA tree or the Tree of Knowledge. The tree was preserved during the development and building of the school and was incorporated into the design of the steps leading up to the building. Although the tree stood tall for almost 40 years, it ultimately could not stand the test of time and succumbed to structural defects. Two days before the removal of the tree, the school held a small farewell ceremony for the tree where students put up a lively performance and recounted their memories of the tree.
The legacy of the tree continues to live on in â€œThe Seedâ€, an art piece inspired by the seeds of the Angsana tree. The artwork is installed on the exact location where the tree used to stand and continues to welcome the students and visitors to the SOTA campus.
Bodhi Trees (Ficus religiosa)
Location: Singapore Management University Campus Green
The Bodhi Tree was transplanted into SMU's Campus Green and is a popular rest spot for students during their lunch breaks. 
A venerable Bodhi Tree resides in the quiet compound of the SMU Campus Green. The tree is believed to be over a hundred years old and started life as a seed planted by a prisoner of the old Bras Basah convict jail. It was uprooted in 2005 when SMU started construction of its campus on the old site of the former prison complex and replanted and integrated into the current SMU Campus Green landscape.
The Bodhi Tree is a medium fig tree that is native to the Indian subcontinent and part of China. It has naturalised in Singapore and can be found growing spontaneously. The leaves have a distinctive tail-like tip and are spirally arranged on the branches. This tree is worshipped by the Hindus and Buddhists and is usually planted around temples. It is believed that the Buddha sat under this species of tree when he achieved realisation.
Travellers Palm Trees (Ravenala madagascariensis)
Location: Raffles Hotel
The Traveller's Palm tree is an iconic feature of Bras Basah Road leading up to the entrance of the Raffles Hotel. 
The entrance of the Raffles Hotel and Bras Basah Road is dotted with towering Traveller's Palm trees, which also inspired the symbol of the Raffles Hotel. Its leaves grow in an East-West orientation and served as a natural compass for travellers in the past. They were also useful as rainwater collects at the base of the leaves, providing much-needed thirst relief.
The name â€œTraveller's Palmâ€ is a misnomer as the plant is not a true palm. While its growth form has a palm-like appearance, it is actually a closer relative of the Bird of Paradise ( Strelitzia reginae ) and the Banana plant ( Musa sp.). The paddle-shaped leaves fan out evenly in a welcoming gesture to passers-by. Similarly, as Singapore slowly eases the COVID-19 safe management measures, we hope to once again welcome visitors back to our City in Nature.
Belinjau Trees (Gnetum gnemon)
Location: Civilian War Memorial
The Belinjau trees standing at attention, almost as if saluting the lost civilian lives in World War II. 
The Civilian War Memorial, located in War Memorial Park, is a national monument that commemorates the lives of the civilian victims of World War II. The footpath leading up to the monument is lined with Belinjau trees on both sides. Native to Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Ocean islands, the Belinjau tree can grow up to 20 m tall and the kernels of the seeds can be made into delicious belinjau crackers. 
The Belinjau trees were specifically chosen to plant in the park due to their conical shape that bear resemblance to the War Memorial. Their straight and upright form looks almost as if they are standing at attention and saluting the civilians who lost their lives in the war. Similarly, the landscape around the park complements the monument and evokes feelings of solemnity.
Green tunnel lined with Rain Trees (Samanea saman)
Location: Along Connaught Drive
Connaught Drive is lined with Rain Trees on both sides, some of which are NParks Heritage Trees.
Another famous sight of Rain Trees lies before the entrance of Esplanade Park. The two rows of Rain Trees were thought to have been planted since the late 1880s, during the time when tree planting was formalised by the then Superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Nathaniel Cantley. Some of the key events witnessed by these trees include Singapore's declaration of de facto independence from British colonial rule in 1963 and the first National Day celebrations held at the Padang in 1966.
Presently, the Rain Trees' lush canopy provides a picturesque framing of the stately colonial buildings on the opposite side of the Padang and creates a cooling â€˜green tunnel' that runs through the heart of the city. In 2016, 22 of the Rain Trees were endorsed as Heritage Trees, forming the â€œAvenue of Heritage Treesâ€. Find out more about Heritage Trees here .
Cannon Ball Trees (Couroupita guianensis)
Location: Esplanade Park
The flowers of the Cannon Ball Tree are unusual and spectacular, drawing visitors to see them up close in person.
The Cannon Ball Tree in Esplanade Park is an impressive sight to behold. With a girth circumference of almost 3 m and flower stalks branching out from its main trunk, one would be drawn closer to take a closer look at this unusual tree. As its name suggests, the Cannon Ball Tree produces large, round fruits on its massive trunk that bear similarity to cannon balls. This growth form of bearing fruits on the main trunk is known as cauliflory. The fruits take 18 months to develop and will remain on the trunk for a year or more before they eventually mature and fall off. The large, showy flowers are used by Hindus in Singapore for worship while in Sri Lanka, they are often used as offerings at Buddhist shrines and temples.
Angsana Trees (Pterocarpus indicus)
Location: Esplanade Park
The five Angsana trees were transplanted into Esplanade Park to recreate the iconic â€œGor Zhang Chiu Karâ€.
Besides the Rain Trees and the Cannon Ball Tree, Esplanade Park is also home to the famous five Angsana trees near the Lim Bo Seng Memorial. This site was a popular dating spot between the 1960s and 1980s and is affectionately known as â€œGor Zhang Chiu Karâ€ in Hokkien, which translates literally to â€œunder the shade of five treesâ€. It was often a stopover for those who were heading to the Satay Club, a food centre nearby at that time.
Angsana trees are large deciduous trees that were introduced to Singapore in the early 19th century and planted widely around the island due to their fast growth and dense, dome-shaped crowns that served as excellent shade providers. Unfortunately, the original five â€˜Gor Zhang Chiu Karâ€ trees had to be removed in the 1990s due to a fungal disease outbreak and to prevent further spread of the disease. In 2015, NParks were able to recreate the nostalgic dating spot by transplanting five disease-resistant Angsana trees from Upper Serangoon Road. A piece of history is thus preserved at the very spot, inviting families and weekend picnickers to revisit fond memories.

This visual diary takes its readers on an adventure Through Nature around the Bras Basah.Bugis precinct. Join NAFA Arts Management students on a walkthrough as they document their observations and research of the many natural elements waiting to be discovered at Fort Canning, Raffles' Garden, and Artisan's Garden. Focusing on the topics of plants and archaeology in Natural Heritage, this essay will present a holistic overview of the prominent presence of natural heritage in the precinct's history.
Text by Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts

The Bras Basah.Bugis precinct is undeniably one of the oldest districts in Singapore. Since the 19th century, it has been home to many diverse communities, arts groups, and national monuments, but also to some of our commonly seen flora and fauna in Singapore. Often associated with historical landmarks such as the former St. Joseph's institution and Maghain Aboth, the precinct brings together some of the most tangible symbols of Singapore's history. A gem carefully tucked away behind the National Museum of Singapore, Fort Canning is home to Singapore's first botanical gardens, where many hidden elements of natural heritage can be discovered. This photo essay will unravel the natural heritage of Fort Canning and the many treasures that it holds. From the magnificent Tree Tunnel with a towering Samanea Saman tree hanging over it, to the Raffles and Artisan's Gardens, this photo essay will detail the natural heritage and archaeological history that BBB has to offer.
Samanea Saman, 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)
The first location of our walk takes us through the Fort Canning Tree Tunnel and up the iconic spiral staircase which leads explorers to a distinctive Samanea Saman tree that towers high above the tunnel. The Samanea Saman tree is easily recognisable by its umbrella-shaped crown that can reach 20m to 30m across! It is also known as Pukul Lima in Malay, which means â€œ5 o'clockâ€. This is a reference to how the tree's leaves fold at sunset, which used to be at 5P.M, before the Singapore Standard Time was changed.
Opened in 2007, the tree tunnel has become one of Singapore's most iconic photography spots. With the beautiful crown of the Samanea Saman reaching over the tree tunnel, sunlight filters through the leaves to illuminate the spiral staircase below. This spot reflects Singapore's relationship between man-made architecture and how our existing natural heritage adapts and complements the changes around it. The Samanea Saman tree has made this location its home before the existence of the tunnel, its strong foothold on Fort Canning being attributed to its tolerance for infertile and waterlogged soils. Despite Singapore's monsoon seasons, this tenacious tree stands tall till today, enhancing Fort Canning landscape as a symbol of Singapore's natural heritage.
Alpinia Purpurata (Red Ginger), 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)
Fort Canning is home to several historical gardens, some of which are named after symbolic figures in Singapore's history. A few minutes of walking from the Tree Tunnel will take you to spots like the Raffles Garden and the Sang Nila Utama Garden which is a hidden treasure trove of flora and fauna. Countless species of ginger, like the Red Ginger pictured above, can be found planted alongside the brick paths, accompanied with iconic flowering plants like the periwinkle.
The Red Ginger in particular, can be found planted alongside Singapore's roadsides and in other tropical areas outside of Asia such as Hawaii. Since its introduction into the Singaporean landscape, the plant has been thought to hold medicinal properties in its stem. Easily identified by its use in traditional medicine, the Alpinia Purpurata is used to treat a wide range of health conditions, including morning sickness, nausea, and cardiovascular disease.
Catharanthus Roseus (Periwinkle), 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)
In the gardens, you will find an abundance of vibrant, flowering plants. One such example is the periwinkle, a perennial plant native to Madagascar. Having been introduced into Singapore's natural landscape, the shrub shares many medicinal traits with the Red Ginger. The Red Ginger is also recognised for its many traditional medicinal properties, even outside of the continent of Asia - its leaves and flower petals are boiled to create teas referred to as â€œsolar teaâ€. It is often sipped throughout the day to help with conditions like toothaches and chest pain. Even modern medical research has shown that certain extracts from the plant can be used in anti-cancer drugs, to treat diseases such as leukaemia and Hogkins' Disease.
However, the Catharanthus Roseus, also known as the Pink Periwinkle, was initially grown as a ground cover, no doubt due to its vibrant, eye-catching pink flowers. Holding the â€œExoticâ€ status under Singapore's National Parks database, the relatively drought-tolerant plant can easily be spotted in shrubs, planted alongside neighbourhood streets and on roadsides.
â€œWildness reminds us what it means to be humanâ€œ

Pandanus Amaryllifolius (Pandan), 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)
Found amongst the leafy and forested landscape of Fort Canning are some easily recognisable plants that contribute to other facets of heritage, such as food. One favourite of Singaporeans and commonly found in most households is pandan. Often used in cooking and baking desserts and local dishes it is also most famously known for making up the bulk of kaya, a traditional spread eaten with bread.
Pandan has been found to host medicinal properties as well. Used in traditional medicine to alleviate pain symptoms, specifically that of arthritis and joint pain, it is a plant that has cemented its place in Singapore's natural heritage landscape. Like many other mainstay ingredients in Singaporean kitchens, the pandan is a plant whose nativity we share with the wider Southeast Asian region. This is not a bad thing though, because iconic heritage elements, such as the pandan, help the region foster a unified tale of history and heritage.
Artisan's Garden, 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)
Yet another treasure trove of Fort Canning is the Artisan's Garden that was said to be built around the 14th century amidst the hill's flora and fauna. Left with only its remains today, it is currently an excavation site and was formerly a craftsman's workshop and living quarters. While the garden no longer withholds as much flora and fauna as it once did, it still showcases the many natural elements that lie below the grounds of Fort Canning. With extensive research detailing the specific soil layers and brickwork found in the garden's foundations, educational panels are placed around the Artisan's Garden to help visitors uncover the rich history of this location. The Artisan's Garden has now become an integral part of the natural heritage found in Fort Canning.
Did you know that Fort Canning holds a shrine dedicated to Sultan Keramat Iskandar Shah, the last king of Singapura and the first Sultan of the Malacca Sultanate? In 1985 and 1988, excavation works near the keramat (shrine) revealed 3 soil types below the top layer. These included red laterite (which was not native to Fort Canning at the time), a dark brown soil that dated back to the 14th century, and a natural yellow soil that had formed due to the weathering of the sandstone bedrock over time. The garden even has exhibits fitted with magnifying lenses for visitors to look at the soil types in detail!
Artisan's Garden, 2022 (Source: Aleesha Rane)
The image above is one example of the type of exhibits found at the Artisan's Garden. A glass showcase holding fragments of traditional porcelain china can be seen, with the fragments laid out on the dirt. Many of the garden's exhibits feature detailed geographical samples, including preserved fragments of china, limestone collections, and sediment types from the ground beneath the garden. Despite the site having been abandoned before discovery, the presence of early 20th century artefacts reaffirmed beliefs that the area had previously been occupied. It also showed how prevalent and extensive trade was at the time, that goods from China and around the region had been found in Singaporean lives.
With your newfound knowledge of natural heritage found integrated with the rich histories of Fort Canning, can you identify other elements of Natural Heritage found around you? We encourage you to explore the natural heritage that is still present in Singapore's landscape today.
Some of the research done in this essay takes reference from traditional medicinal uses that may remain unproven by modern medicine. When exploring the natural heritage of Singapore, we would also like to encourage our readers to love and care for our flora and fauna. Please be reminded that foraging is illegal.

Singapore's pioneering wildlife park has soared across half a century! In this time, Jurong Bird Park became Asia's largest bird park, connecting millions of people to the colourful and fascinating avian world. It actively participated in protecting avian species over the decades, and today contributes as a global conservation leader.
Text by Jurong Bird Park
Singapore's pioneer wildlife park
Jurong Bird Park opened on 3 January 1971, it was considered to be Asia's largest bird park with more than 5,000 birds across 400 species. Built at a cost of S$3.5 million, the concept for Jurong Bird Park was conceived by the late Dr Goh Keng Swee in 1968 while he was in Rio De Janeiro attending a World Bank meeting. During this visit, he had visited a zoological garden and toured its impressive free flight aviary. At a time of rapid urbanisation in Singapore, he saw the bird park as an opportunity for Singaporeans to connect with nature. It was also famously reported that when asked why not build a zoo instead, Dr Goh said ""Birdseeds costs less than meat"". 
At the time of opening, the park included 78 display aviaries, an administration block, a transit and quarantine station, a nursery breeding area, as well as facilities such as a tram system, a restaurant, refreshment kiosks, footpaths, benches and shelters.
The Jurong Bird Park has played hosts to many visitors over the past five decades including several foreign dignitaries such as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, in 1972 when they visited Singapore as part of their Southeast Asian and Indian Ocean tour.

Amongst the key highlights of the Jurong Bird Park is the Waterfall Aviary which towers at a height of 35-metre (equivalent to 13 storeys). Known originally as Jurong Falls Aviary when the park opened, was introduced as an answer to the problem of what to do with the steep, hilly valley of the park grounds. The aviary would be enhanced by a waterfall that would create varying habitats within the valley for a variety of bird species. The result was an experience where free flying birds lived and one that thrilled millions of visitors. It also houses one of the world's highest man-made, indoor waterfalls. Standing at 30-metre-tall, water plunge over the top of a towering cliff at a rate of 140 litres per second. The water is then recirculated through a meandering stream that cascades down over a series of levels, creating an ideal environment for the hundreds of free-flying birds and thousands of plants.

The Jurong Bird Park reopened Jurong Falls Aviary as Waterfall Aviary in 1993 after a revamp as part of a Master Plan to upgrade itself for the changing times, as well as improve the living conditions of the birds and giving visitors a more complete experience of the park.
A monorail system was introduced to Jurong Bird Park in 1992. Dubbed the Panorail, it was a dramatic way for visitors to arrive at the revamped Waterfall Aviary in 1993. It stopped at the Waterfall Station, the world's first monorail station inside a walk-in aviary at that time. Credit: Jurong Bird Park

As the predecessor to the current Pools Amphitheatre, the old Citizen's amphitheatre which opened in 1988 catered to a capacity of only 800 pax, and was reportedly overflowed with audience during the animal presentations. On 5 Jan 1992, it made way for the existing Pools Amphitheatre which featured the new JBP All Stars Bird Show, with an increased capacity of 2,000 pax. At the time of completion, the amphitheatre had the largest canopy in the world.

In 1972, the penguin exhibit was called Penguin Pool and a crowd favourite. It then made way for a new exhibit â€“ Penguin Parade in the 1980s that gave visitors a view of the penguins above and under water. The exhibit underwent a major upgrade in 2010 to become the current exhibit today, the Penguin Coast. During that time, an outdoor exhibit was also built specially for the African penguins. where they are free to go for a swim by the pool under the sun or retreat to their air-conditioned den. Found only on the south-western coast of Africa, the African penguins are perfectly adaptable to cool or warm temperatures.

Nurturing future generations of avian advocates
Since its early days, the Jurong Bird Park sought to nurture an increased appreciation, interest, and knowledge of birds in school children and teachers through various educational activities and programmes. These include audio visual presentations, bird talks, and slide shows conducted at both bird park as well as school assemblies. The setting up of the falconry museum at the Fuji Hawk Centre all contribute to further knowledge enhancements.

Breeding and Research
Over the decades, avian care research and conservation at the park have grown from strength to strength. A Breeding and Research Centre was established in 1988 to strengthen the park's on-going efforts in the breeding and management of birds under human care, especially rare and endangered species, as well as develop research into areas such as nutrition, parasitology and environment physiology. In the same year in August, a Memorandum of Understanding was also signed between Jurong Bird Park and National University Singapore to establish a joint Avian Research Programme. The accord was arrived in the hope that it would enhance the park's breeding record further and highlight the significance of both the Bird Park and the NUS as centres for contribution of ornithological knowledge in Southeast Asia and the world.
The Breeding and Research Centre was subsequently opened to the public in 2012 to give visitors a behind-the-scenes look into how the avian care team take on the role of foster parents to care for chicks that need to be hand-raised or eggs that need to be hatched under the watchful eye of the avian caretakers to maximise their chances of survival.
Many threatened species bred in the park since include several world-first breeding accolades for species such as the Great Hornbill, Black Hornbill, Twelve-wired Bird-of-paradise and Santa Cruz Ground-dove.
Bonus Fun Fact!
Did you know â€“ two of the park's oldest residents have been here since it opened! The oldest bird is Rod the Egyptian vulture. It is estimated that he is about 60 years old as he was already an adult bird when Jurong Bird Park first opened in 1971.
The park's second oldest bird, and oldest cockatoo is Big John. He was also an adult when the park first opened and served as the inspiration for the park's first mascot in 1985. Big John captured many Singaporean hearts as star of animal presentations including the High Flyers presentation. He is now retired and makes public appearances on special occasions such as Jurong Bird Park's 50th anniversary.

As a historical monument residing up in Admiral hill, the structures of old Admiralty House is surrounded by luscious vegetation. The essay will explore the role of the old Admiralty house in not just preserving Sembawang's heritage, but also in illustrating the relationship between built environment and the natural landscape.
Text by N Brentha Shini (NTU History Programme)
Despite its modest size, Sembawang has developed into an estate renowned for its historical significance and natural heritage, especially with its early history as a town once covered in pineapple plantations and rubber estates. National Heritage Board (NHB)'s Sembawang trail recognises the town's natural heritage as a key chapter in its history. The preservation of Sembawang's natural hot spring serves as an example of how the natural landscape shaped the lived experiences of diverse communities. However, with an increasing focus on Singapore's urban landscape, the prevalence of the built environment and its interaction with the natural landscape has become an important aspect of our natural heritage.
Built environment preservation refers to the maintenance of man-made structures with strong historical importance to the environment and its people. The protection of these structures and the environment they stand on is significant to Singapore's heritage. With the aid of Ms Stella Woo from NHB's Preservation of Sites & Monuments (PSM) division, who provided me with valuable insights on monumental preservation, this essay will explore how the preservation of old Admiralty House demonstrates the relationship between Sembawang's built and natural environment.

The old Admiralty House is a magnificent colonial-style building with over 70 years of history. Dating back to the 1920s, when the British Royal Navy first started â€œsurveying work for the British naval baseâ€ in northern Singapore, the house was designed for the Commodore Superintendent of the Royal Navy Dockyard as part of the planning for residential construction in the area1. From its completion in 1939 up to 2002, the old Admiralty house witnessed various changes to its name, owners and functions. With its long history, the monument survived through the colonial era with its distinctive structure intact and was gazetted as a national monument in 20022.

Despite different changes over the years, the monument's Arts and Craft architecture - known for the usage of natural materials - has been carefully preserved by the PSM. Its original asymmetrical layout and homely appearance remain intact regardless of the constant developing urban environment.3 The iconic pitch-tiled roof, arched entrance, and timber-mullioned windows undergo maintenance to allow visitors to appreciate the full glory of the building.4 As part of Sembawang's Heritage Trail which focuses on different aspects of Sembawang's history, NHB included the old Admiralty house under the â€œCommunities of Sembawangâ€ route to allow citizens to remember and understand the town's past as a former British naval base.
The old Admiralty House resides on the top of Admiral hill, located in the midst of Sembawang's urban settlement. With countless towering palm trees alongside visibly-appealing flower bushes surrounding the perimeter of the house, Admiral hill remains a symbol of Sembawang's natural beauty. Furthermore, as a town once covered in rubber plantations, the preservation of the forested hill serves as a poignant reminder of Sembawang's once-vibrant natural environment that has now been taken over by urbanisation.

The hill's luscious greenery sets the ideal atmosphere for civilians interested in immersing themselves in the rich history of the old Admiralty house. As you walk alongside the pathways surrounded by the hill's vibrant biodiversity, you get a chance to detach yourself from the hectic urban lifestyle and revisit historical memories by imagining what the area was like in Colonial Singapore. Therefore, with the preservation of Admiral hill's natural environment enhancing the significance of the house, this serves as an example of how nature and man-made structures complement each other.

Albeit the government's decision to redevelop the area into Bukit Canberra, the architecture of old Admiralty House and its surrounding natural environment remain protected. Under the Preservation Guidelines Volume II, PSM ensures the protection of the old Admiralty house for posterity from insensitive installations that threaten the authenticity of the monument, such as removing any unnecessary additions to the infrastructure. Furthermore, the government will retain Admiral hill's natural elements by carefully preserving the hill's existing landscape.5 There will also be the planting of more trees and shrubs to further enhance the area's greenery and biodiversity.
Functioning as a place that merges the natural landscape with Sembawang's heritage area, Bukit Canberra will allow civilians to appreciate the vibrant biodiversity and also remember the historical origins of the old Admiralty House and Sembawang's heritage as a whole.

The old Admiralty House serves as an example of how man-made structures and the natural landscape can coexist, contributing to the image of Singapore as a City in Nature. The preservation of the house's architecture alongside the surrounding natural landscape come together in retaining the memory of Sembawang's former past as a British naval base.
Therefore, linking back to natural heritage, protecting the tangible memories of the house and its surrounding nature contributes to memorialising Sembawang's rich history and emphasises the importance of natural landscapes to urban society.

The orchid is commonly known by Singaporeans as our national flower - Vanda Miss Joaquim. While many countries have national flowers too, the orchid is more than a national flower in Singapore's case. It is also a tool used in Singapore's diplomatic relations. This essay explores this little-known aspect of our natural heritage.
Text by Theiswar Murali, Ng Ping Siang
2022, Theiswar Murali
What do you think of when the word â€˜orchid' comes to mind? Chances are, you might remember it as the national flower of Singapore, Vanda Miss Joaquim, which is named after Agnes Joaquim, a renowned horticulturalist. But did you know that Agnes Joaquim is not the only figure to have an orchid hybrid named after her? The naming of orchid hybrids after heads of states and equivalent VIPs, also known as orchid diplomacy, has been a longstanding effort in Singaporean natural heritage. As such, the orchid is more than just a national flower â€“ it is a flower that establishes Singapore on the international stage as well.
Orchids are unique in that viable, fertile offspring can be produced from the crossbreeding of species not only within the same genus but also from different related genera, making it possible for a great variety of hybrids to be created. By the 1950s, Singapore had established her reputation as a centre for excellence in orchid hybridisation and cultivation. Renowned orchid breeder Tan Hoon Siang's Papilionanda Tan Chay Yan - a showy, peach and salmon coloured orchid - won a First-Class Certificate at the Chelsea Flower Show in London in 1954, placing Singapore on the world map for orchid hybridisation and cultivation. This was a win that placed Singapore at the forefront of orchid breeding efforts.
Then Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Richard Eric Holttum, was inspired by Vanda Miss Joaquim, which was popularly grown in many Singaporean households then, to experiment in the field of orchid hybridisation. Holttum employed Lewis Knudson's revolutionary method of asymbiotic orchid germination (a method that accelerated the growth of seedlings in controlled conditions) in 1928 to produce his first orchid hybrid, Spathoglottis Primrose, which flowered in 1931. Holttum continued to create many more hybrids, registering a total of 28 hybrids during his 27 years of employment at the Gardens. Hybrids created by Holttum like Aranthera James Storie and Aranda Deborah were used for export and contributed to the growth of the cut flower industry in Singapore.
Aranthera Anne Black was the first orchid hybrid which was part of Singapore's orchid diplomacy initiative, named after Lady Anne Black, wife of the former Governor of Singapore, in 1956. 2022, Theiswar Murali.
Building upon the firm foundation set by Holttum, the Singapore Botanic Gardens developed a uniquely Singaporean diplomatic technology, using orchids as symbols of diplomacy with other states. With more than 200 registered hybrids named after visiting heads of states and equivalent VIPs, orchid diplomacy remains one of Singapore's unique approaches when it comes to fostering relations with other countries today.
Singapore has long employed the gifting of orchids. Looking at its history, one traces Singapore's orchid diplomacy all the way back to 1956 when the first orchid, Aranthera Anne Black, was named after Lady Anne Black, wife of Singapore's former governor Sir Robert Black. In a more contemporaneous context, the orchid hybrid, Papilionanda Kamala Harris, was named after the Vice President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris, during her official visit to Singapore on 23 August 2021.
Today, a prized collection of these VIP orchids has become an important attraction of the National Orchid Garden. Why is it such an important tool in Singapore's context?
Importance of Orchid Diplomacy
Working on this potential of the orchid, Singapore has refined it into a diplomatic tool by specialising in orchid breeding â€“ a form of diplomacy to signify her relations with other nations.
Orchid diplomacy serves as a gesture of friendship to promote goodwill and foster closer ties between Singapore and other countries. An exclusive gesture accorded to foreign dignitaries â€“ such as with the U.S. Vice President stated above â€“ it plays an important role in fostering and building Singapore's bilateral relations. To date, Singapore is the only country in the world to have such an orchid diplomacy initiative.
Now the question remains â€“ why does such a diplomatic tool matter for Singapore? As with China and panda diplomacy, orchids are in this case, Singapore's â€œpandasâ€. As a maritime hub that connects multiple countries together, Singapore's bilateral relations are of utmost importance to her identity and survival. Furthermore, the lack of natural resources often places Singapore at a disadvantaged position when dealing on the international table. Just as how the creation of NEWater has generated an alternative route of water, orchid breeding is another display of scientific effort by Singapore to improve its ties with the world.

In a world with rising globalisation and transnational movements, international relations are becoming even more pertinent in this context. As an international hub and â€œheartâ€ of such a globalising world, orchid diplomacy is thus a crucial part of our heritage and Singapore's identity.
Located within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the National Orchid Garden has the largest and most comprehensive permanent tropical orchid display in Asia, with over 1,500 orchid species and 2,000 orchid hybrids on display. It comprises thematic display areas such as the VIP Orchid Garden and Celebrity Orchid Garden. Most recently, enhancements have been undertaken to rejuvenate the National Orchid Garden, culminating in the opening of the Tropical Montane Orchidetum in April 2021. The Tropical Montane Orchidetum consists of The Sembcorp Cool House, the Yuen Peng McNeice Bromeliad Collection, and the Tan Hoon Siang Mist House, and has provided the Gardens more opportunities to hybridise orchid species from different habitats, further strengthening its capabilities in orchid hybridisation.

The Oriental Magpie Robin is a beloved songbird once known as the â€œStraits Robinâ€ by British bird-watchers. Cultural practices of bird-watching and other ways of appreciating birdsong are traced through the changing biodiversity of a rapidly urbanising Singapore.
Text by Wong Xinyuan, Loh Yi Fong/Nanyang Technological University
A bird chirps in its captivity in a Sembawang homeowner's flat. Years ago, this area used to be mangroves, ponds, mudflats, and grasslands. An early dawn's bird-watch could yield fifty distinct species in the early 1970s. Might birds in the wilderness that used to exist there, have chirped similarly - and who remembers their birdsong till today?
Senoko (Sungei Sembawang) map 1990, p.97, from the Master Plan for the Conservation of Nature in Singapore, by Malayan Nature Society (Singapore Branch), ISBN 981-00-2327-8.
Birds are a part of our natural heritage. Firstly, it is not only Nature Society (Singapore) (NSS) Bird Group, the Kebun Bahru Birdsinging Club, or specialists who know bird species by name. Many older Singaporeans still have latent knowledge about birds, harkening back to their childhoods in kampongs. Secondly, Singapore is a biodiversity hotspot where birds play key roles in the ecosystem, helping to maintain them, while also connecting us to the past.
The Oriental Magpie Robin (Copsychus saularis) is a curious native species, once so common as to be known as the â€œStraits Robinâ€ by British naturalists in the then Malayan Nature Society. The birdwatching community renamed the bird to Magpie Robin after realising that it was also found elsewhere beyond the Straits Settlement. Â¹ Among common folk, its names included the Murai-Kampung Biasa, é¹Šé¸², and kuruvi. In the process of exchanging names, communities congregated to admire its magnificent birdsong. Â²

Besides the local's immersion in nature, birdwatching trips became an important way to pay more attention to the natural world. As our interviewee, Tan Gim Cheong from NSS Bird Group, shares, present-day bird enthusiasts follow a well-trodden path in learning the ways of the birds around us. As the hobby of going on nature walks spreads to more ordinary people, curiosity and interest in making kin with the non-human leads them to eventually study naturalists' books and know the times of the year when a bird is nesting, that dawn is the best time to go bird-watching, and eventually all their names, just like how youngsters get acquainted with the game â€œPokemonâ€.

A Naturalist's Guide to the Birds of Singapore. 2013, Retrieved from https://singapore.kinokuniya.com/bw/9781912081653 .
Tan Gim Cheong is a 49-year-old Singaporean man who heads the Bird Group of NSS. Not only did he discuss how technology and the passage of time have influenced birding practices, he also shared about the role played by museums, naturalists, and illustrators in cultivating an appreciation of birdlife. NSS is one of the oldest and most reputable environmental organisations in Singapore, having split off in 1991 from its predecessors - the Malayan Nature Society (1940) and Singapore Natural History Society (1921). While digital photography tends to be taken for granted today, illustrations and drawings were an important way of getting to know the birds of Malaya, and remain important in emphasising characteristic features.
1970s was a time of rapid urbanisation. The Animals and Birds Act was passed in 1965 to regulate the bird trade. Bird trade was more strictly regulated with vaccinations and checks on diseases, as well as rigorous import-export limits. Many imported or traded pet birds that were not native to Singapore, such as parrots and macaws. This meant increased complexity in how biodiversity was managed. Imported birds that escape could potentially become invasive, harming native birds and disrupting local ecosystems.
The magpie robin declined from being common in earlier days, to requiring a re-introduction programme by NParks in the early 1980s. Gim Cheong comments that this was initially assessed to be a failure, as the re-introduced birds may have been poached, however the magpie robin is now a regular at some sites.Â³ Today, it remains a threatened species, and in many places has been replaced by the Javan mynah.â´ âµ

Today, kampongs are replaced by high-rise buildings that we associate with the Housing Development Board (HDB), while birdsong appreciation has shifted from wild birds to caged imported birds. Citizen science programmes aim to build understanding and love for biodiversity among Singaporeans, as does the calendar provided by LepakInSg provide a means of joining different environmental activities. â¶ The annual Bird Race by NSS Bird Group continues to gather competing teams to count as many birds as possible at dawn. Many of these birds remain common in natural heritage areas, like Pulau Ubin and Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve.â·
Will the cry of the magpie robin still be known and loved by children today who grow up in the urban landscape and not wilderness? Will our streets become silent?

Regarded as the national emblem for tourism and one of Singapore's most popular attractions, the Merlion statue at Merlion Park turns 50 this year. As we celebrate its golden jubilee, read on to learn more about the symbolism and lesser-known stories behind the beloved icon.
Text by Singapore Tourism Board
The Merlion is a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish, that was first created in 1964 as the corporate logo for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB). The Merlion's trademark was registered on 20 July 1966 and the logo was used for 33 years up till 1997. Although the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) changed its logo in 1997, the board retains exclusive rights to use the symbol.
The Merlion's creator was British zoologist Alec Fraser-Brunner, then curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium in Singapore. The Merlion's fish-like body is a nod to Singapore's origins as a fishing village historically known as Temasek. The lion head recalls the legend in the Malay Annals when Sang Nila Utama, a Srivijayan prince of Palembang, first landed on the shores of this island. He saw a strange beast near the mouth of the Singapore River which he later identified as a lion, leading him to rename Temasek as Singapura (lion city in Sanskrit).
The original logo of STPB featured the iconic Merlion. 1964, STPB
The first Merlion statue was constructed in 1972 by local sculptor Lim Nang Seng, based on a blueprint by artist Kwan Sai Kheong. Mr Lim was commissioned to build the statue after winning several prizes in the Singapore Handicraft and Design competition organised by STPB.
Unbeknownst to many Singaporeans, the late Mr Lim did not build the Merlion alone â€“ he had the help of all his eight children, then aged 11 to 23. The older ones would climb up the wooden scaffolding and work on the Merlion's eyes, while the younger children would carve out the fish scales and fins on the Merlion's tail. The children were happy to help their father and would go down to the site (the original Merlion Park at the mouth of the Singapore River) almost every day before or after school.
â€œTo my dad this was not just a sculpture for Singapore, it was also a lasting gift to all of us [his family].â€
- Mr Albert Lim, son of Mr Lim Nang Seng (originally quoted in The New Paper on April 22, 2002)
Before building the Merlion, Mr Lim was a pioneer of sculpture in Singapore who exhibited regularly at local arts exhibitions. He reportedly studied sculptural techniques from a young age and designed the first batch of Singapore's one-cent coins in 1967.

On 15 September 1972, then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew officiated the installation ceremony and unveiled the Merlion statue at the mouth of the Singapore River. Along with the larger 8.6m high statue, Mr Lim also constructed a smaller 2m tall statue that is commonly referred as the â€œMerlion cubâ€. The Merlion statue faced east, an auspicious feng shui (Chinese geomancy) orientation that is believed to bring prosperity. True enough, the Merlion Park became a popular tourist spot that was known far and wide.

The Merlion found worldwide fame in 1987 when Miss Universe contestants from 68 countries gathered for a famous group photo with the national landmark. That year was the first and only time when Singapore hosted the Miss Universe pageant. Organised by STPB, the event generated much buzz among Singaporeans and was televised worldwide to an estimated 600 million viewers in 56 countries.

Over the years, the statue deteriorated and stopped spouting water periodically. This was because its pump system was corroded by exposure to seawater. In 1997, the Esplanade Bridge was built to increase accessibility from the Downtown area to Nicoll Highway and Marina Centre, but this meant that views of the Merlion from the waterfront were blocked. These reasons brought about a pressing need for the Merlion to be re-located and restored. In 2002, eight locations were considered and evaluated before the decision was made to move the Merlion to One Fullerton, just 120m away from its original home. It was also important that the Merlion remained near the mouth of the Singapore River as the location was historically significant â€“ it marks the area where Sang Nila Utama had spotted what he thought was a lion.

The historic move for the Merlion and its cub was not a simple one. The operation took days and required Esplanade Drive, a two-way road across the Esplanade Bridge, to be closed. Initially, engineers had a relatively straightforward plan to transport the Merlion under the Esplanade Bridge on a hopper barge. As the statue was thought to be 8m high, it would have just managed to squeeze under the bridge.
However, an additional 0.6m of reinforced concrete under the statue was found when workers dug down to its foundations. The Merlion had no choice but to go over the bridge, and this was done in three stages. First, a crane was used to lift the Merlion from its old position onto a barge that sailed and docked beside the Esplanade Bridge. Then, two 500-tonne cranes were deployed to hoist the 70-tonne Merlion from the barge onto the bridge, and from the bridge back onto the barge that had then sailed to the other side of the bridge. This meant that the Merlion would have been airborne for about five minutes. The journey was completed after the barge transported the Merlion to its new position, where it was installed on a pedestal at One Fullerton. The public was invited to witness the big move as the national icon left its original home for the first time in 30 years.

At its new home at One Fullerton, the Merlion was placed against the backdrop of the Fullerton Hotel and the Raffles Place skyline where it remains today. The Merlion stands on reclaimed land and is once again the gatepost at the mouth of the Singapore River. In addition to the face-lift and restoration of the sculpture, the new Merlion Park also has a viewing deck for tourists to take photographs with the popular icon.

Did you know that the Merlion statue was once struck by lightning? This occurred on 28 February 2009 during a heavy downpour in the late afternoon. A piece of the statue fell from the Merlion's mane and caused a hole on the waveform at its base. Fortunately, nobody was hurt. The Merlion statue was closed for a month for workers to rectify the damage â€“ and implement lightning protection measures. 
In 2011, the Merlion statue was transformed into a month-long pop-up hotel. Dubbed the â€œMerlion Hotelâ€, it was a 100 square-metre luxury suite operated by the Fullerton Hotel that came fully-fitted with a double bed, bathroom, balcony, amenities, and a dedicated butler. This unique installation built around the statue was designed by Japanese artist Tatzu Nishi as part of the Singapore Biennale 2011. The Merlion Hotel was open during the day for public visits between 10am and 7pm, while overnight stays that were priced at S$150 a night sold out in a matter of hours.

The Merlion is not just a Singapore icon. It can be found all over the world, including Hakodate, the third-largest city in Hokkaido, Japan. An 8.6m tall Merlion â€œsiblingâ€ statue is located there, symbolising the long-time friendship between Hakodate and Singapore. This special relationship began in 1992, when STB and the Hakodate International Tourism and Convention Association (HITCA) signed an agreement to mutually promote tourism.

The Merlion has also been the inspiration behind many works by local writers, such as Ulysses by the Merlion by Edwin Thumboo, and The Merlion to Ulysses by Lee Tzu Pheng as a response to Thumboo. It was also featured with four limbs that enabled it to swim and walk in Gwee Li Sui's Myth of The Stone, Singapore's first full-length English graphic novel.

Natural heritage can be found everywhere around us here in Singapore - even in our own backyards! This article explores how HortPark, as a one-stop gardening resource hub, advances gardening and green landscaping initiatives that remain valiant efforts at the green agenda and preserving Singapore's natural heritage!
Text by Neo Yu Zhe (NTU History Programme)
When we think of some of Singapore's nature reserves and parks, we often think of popular locations like the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. With over 400 parks and four nature reserves in Singapore managed by National Parks Board (NParks), parks like HortPark remain less known to Singaporeans. For this article, I have had the pleasure of interviewing HortPark's Director, Shirley Ling, and Deputy Director, Lim Jin Hong, who provided interesting insights. While all parks and nature reserves contribute to Singapore's green agenda, this article is interested in HortPark's role in conserving and promoting Singapore's natural heritage and biodiversity.
Two of HortPark's famous Green Wall installations featuring various green wall systems developed since 2008, 2022.
Located near the Southern Ridges, HortPark first opened its gates to the public on 10th May 2008. With the ideation process that started in the early 2000s, HortPark is â€œa one-stop gardening resource hubâ€ that NParks envisioned as a space unique from all the other parks and nature reserves in Singapore had in the 2000s.1 Chiefly, HortPark provides the gardening and landscaping communities and industries space for research and design and a blank canvas for showcases. Moreover, as a destination park, HortPark is replete with amenities for the public too. Whether one has a passion for gardening or simply there to enjoy the natural environment, HortPark has it all. According to Ling and Lim, natural heritage in HortPark's eyes is synonymous with horticulture.2 One of the key ways HortPark has contributed to preserving Singapore's natural heritage is by promoting the importance of our natural environment and biodiversity.
Butterfly Garden @ HortPark. Pro-tip: Head to HortPark early in the morning to catch the butterflies in action, 2022.
HortPark's butterfly garden is an excellent example. An installation that initially started as an enclosure gradually expanded into an open concept garden. By planting plant species that attract butterflies, the butterfly garden became a prototypal garden for HortPark's butterfly outreach programmes to schools and other gardens around the island. Through outreach efforts like â€œSave The Common Bird Wingâ€, HortPark has contributed to the conservation of butterflies and, in doing so, also attracted other species that makeup Singapore's natural ecosystems. Consequently, endangered and once thought extinct butterflies have been spotted again in Singapore. Importantly, Ling and Lim stress HortPark's overall efforts culminates in its critical role in advocating for greenery as a whole â€“ understanding that whatever that is within greenery comes with it â€“ to its audience.
Closeup of one of the Green Walls installations that provide inspirations for home gardeners and industry partners alike, 2022.
As a hub for gardening and landscaping, HortPark facilitates horticulture innovation.3 As a facilitator, HortPark provides stakeholders with spaces to research, design, and innovate. The Green Walls installations were originally intended for research when HortPark first opened. In the early 2010s, Green Walls were uncommon and mostly unheard of in Singapore. As such, HortPark provided a space to showcase the uses, viability, and aesthetics of Green Walls to industry partners. Various companies used this space to research suitable plant types and systems for Singapore's environment. As Green Walls started to gain traction and became more widely used, HortPark subsequently rented out these Green Wall spaces to various landscape companies to showcase their Green Walls to the public. Of course, apart from Green Walls, HortPark also has other showcase spaces like raised gardening planter spaces (Vegepod) and aquaponics systems. Thus at HortPark, innovation brings forth urban promotion of our natural heritage. 
Allotment Garden in HortPark where enthusiasts are allotted a plot of gardening space to embark on their gardening endeavours, 2022.
The English Garden â€“ one of HortPark's many themed gardens to provide gardeners and landscapers with inspiration, 2022.
The Edible Garden â€“ another themed gardens that provide visitors with the many types of edible plants they can plant, 2022.
Apart from providing spaces for industry partners and companies, HortPark also features spaces to inspire the general public and gardening and landscape enthusiasts with creative ideas to develop their gardens at home. With over twenty small themed gardens like the edible garden and companion planting garden, each garden provides people with ideas on the endless possibilities of home-style gardening. HortPark even features a sizeable allotment garden (featured above) for gardening enthusiasts to showcase their green talents! At this juncture, I questioned if small actions like planting a few edible plants in the comfort of our homes would have any significant impacts on the preservation of greenery in Singapore. For Shirley and Jin Hong, though these may be small actions, they believe that they are necessary â€œbaby stepsâ€ that would nurture Singaporean's passion and love for greenery and green spaces.
My Backyard Kitchen Garden showcases plants suitable to transform a kitchen into a backyard kitchen, 2022.
While Shirley and Jin Hong, acknowledge that HortPark may not have a very obvious or direct impact compared to bigger spaces like nature reserves or the botanic gardens, HortPark's focus on gardening and green landscaping are valiant efforts in fighting for the green agenda. By communicating this intention in its direct engagement with its primary target audience â€“ the gardening and landscape communities and industries as well as anyone interested â€“ HortPark takes on a key role in conserving and promoting the nation's natural heritage and biodiversity. If you have a chance, head down to HortPark to enjoy its themed gardens.

Northeast Hinterland is a series of nocturnes in Punggol, when sleep and sight are paradoxical, when the land's histories, mythologies and legacies play hide-and-seek with the past, present and future of its custodianship. â€œHinterlandâ€, from the German word hinter, refers to a remote area beyond metropolitan, cultural centres, beyond the visible or known.
Text by Kevin WY Lee/June 2015 residency at Exactly Foundation

The name â€œPunggol,â€ from the Malay word pengger (â€œdead branchesâ€), is understood by some as â€œhurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring them down to the groundâ€. Punggol was initially called Tanjong Rangon, as seen in the Jackson Plan of 1822, which also known as the â€œPlan of the Town of Singaporeâ€, was devised by Sir Stamford Raffles as a blueprint for rapid urbanization and order in colonial Singapore. Devised by Philip Jackson, the colony's land surveyor, the Plan divided Singapore into ethnic, functional subdivisions, laid out in a grid pattern. 
Northeast Hinterlandis a series of nocturnes of Punggol. The night is an interesting time. A Chinese saying, jian bu de guang(è§ä¸å¾—å…‰), refers to that which cannot see the light of day. It is an intriguing expression. In the dark, we cannot see, so our eyes give way to our minds for sight. We predict and imagine. And this imagination is usually moulded either from fear or wonderment, what we know and what we don't. Our fate lies in the hands of those who have power and light, and our path is determined by where they choose to beam and illuminate. The night cloaks, and the moon, an obscure distant mirror, renders a surreal palette of hues and colours that lack the direct luminance of the sun. Specific to photography, I wanted to explore seeing in the dark through long exposures beyond the possibilities of my own eyes.

The press called it a â€œNoah's Arkâ€. Albert Einstein, was one of its first visitors in 1922 and said it was â€œa wonderful zoological gardenâ€. The zoo was eventually taken over and destroyed by the British Army to fight the Japanese invasion in 1942. The British shot the animals and freed the birds. 'Animal Man' was devastated and passed away a year later in 1943.

My maternal grandfather came to Singapore during the Sino-Japanese War (1937â€“45). My mother's memories of him are vague, almost non-existent. His name was Luo Gen Ji, but she isn't entirely sure. He apparently worked in carpentry on a wharf in Singapore. In his first few years, he sent money and letters back home. Then one day the money and letters stopped, and no word was heard from him ever since. His disappearance coincided with Japan's invasion and occupation of Singapore (1942â€“45) during the Second World War. Our family believes that he perished at the hands of the Japanese military.

Since 1965, Chan Brothers Travel has been delivering guided tour packages and other travel services to travellers from Singapore. Tracing its history allows us to understand how brick-and-mortar tour agencies had shaped the experiences of Singaporean travellers and responded to changing travel trends during the 1960s-90s.
Text by Chong Wen Xiu Trina (NTU History Programme)

Pre-COVID, Singapore ranked among the most popular tourist destinations worldwide. The Singapore Tourism Board (formerly Singapore Tourist Promotion Board) had taken deliberate efforts to attract visitors to the little red dot. But from the 1980s, Singapore was just as notable for its outbound tourism, having seen more than 500,000 tourist departures in 1986. Have you ever wondered what travelling was like for Singaporeans during the 1960s-90s?
Travel, especially for leisure, did not gain much traction in the first decade of Singapore's independence. The economic challenges of unemployment and shrinking entrepot trade meant that many Singaporeans could afford neither the time nor money to go on a holiday. Leisure tourism was thus a luxury that only a minority of Singaporeans had access to. Contrastingly, short trips to neighbouring Malaysia were popular especially during the Lunar New Year. 
For the lucky ones, securing a train or air ticket to a foreign country was just the start. A successful trip required elements such as accommodation, food and transport to places of interest. Yet in the 1960s-early 1970s, sources of information that tourists could rely on were limited and disparate. Travel guidebooks by Lonely Planet and tourist maps informed Singaporean travellers about the history, customs and attractions of various destinations. These formal resources were supplemented by word of mouth from experienced travellers with useful tips to impart to their less experienced counterparts. Nonetheless, the scarcity of such resources made it a hassle to plan trips.

It was in this context of â€˜information underload' that tour agencies rose in influence. In a modest pre-war shophouse at Cecil Street stood Chan Brothers Travel, a three-staff company that initially sold air and train tickets to nearby countries. The company was founded in 1965 by Mr Chan Liang Choy who recognised the potential for growth in the travel and tourism industry as Singapore's economy developed. Born in China's Fujian Province in 1924, Mr Chan Liang Choy had worked for several years in Myanmar and Singapore before starting a business in his family name at age 41. The business soon began selling guided tour packages. Several years and many successful tours later, Chan Brothers Travel moved to Fook Hai Building and became a household name.

Chan Brothers Travel provided a one-stop solution for travellers who lacked the know-how and/or patience to settle their travel arrangements. The direct links the company enjoyed with airlines, hotels and overseas agents enabled it to streamline the booking process while providing its customers with reliable, affordable services. A tour booking typically started with a trip to the Chan Brothers Travel office at Fook Hai Building, where one would be handed a collection of travel brochures indicating the prices and itineraries of available packages. Albums that compiled photographs taken by Chan Brothers Travel tour leaders on previous trips were also used as a sales tool to pique the potential customer's interest in destinations on offer. A week or two before the trip, mass pre-departure briefings would also be conducted in mini theatrettes in the Chan Brothers Travel office.

By the 1980s, Chan Brothers Travel tours not only covered Asian destinations like Hong Kong, Thailand and the Philippines, but also distant countries in Australia, Europe and North America. The diversity of destinations indicated Chan Brothers Travel's success, which was related to Singaporeans' growing appetite for travel.

Indeed, the 1980s saw a significant boom in the outbound travel market. Rising income levels coupled with the opening of Singapore Changi Airport in 1981 made travel easier and more affordable. Singaporeans redefined the value of travel: as a necessary respite from the monotony of work, a family bonding experience and even a retirement reward. But as travellers became more seasoned, their expectations and traveling styles also evolved. This led Chan Brothers Travel to expand and differentiate their product offerings. 
In 1983, the company introduced the â€œhotel-on-wheelsâ€ concept which brought Singaporeans on tours around Europe in double decker buses fitted with sleeping berths and a kitchen. The tours resembled a camping trip since travellers were involved in the cooking and cleaning. A Free and Easy Travel department was also set up to render travel assistance to those who preferred to travel independently. Other available itineraries included romantic trips for couples, school trips and incentive trips. Evidently, travel preferences shifted over time and tour agencies like Chan Brothers Travel had to adapt to these changes in order to remain relevant and competitive.

Tour leaders put on many hats. Ms Koh, a former tour leader at Chan Brothers Travel shared that besides managing the group and explaining sites of interest, tour leaders also needed to respond effectively to unforeseen situations like injuries or flight delays. Some travellers might even request special arrangements such as flowers or a cake for their wedding anniversaries. 
Recognising the significant role played by tour leaders, Chan Brothers Travel embarked on a consultancy project with the National Productivity Board (predecessor of the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board or SPRING Singapore) in 1990 to provide customised employee training. The first of its kind in the travel industry, the project was extended to all of its 150 employees, from tour leaders to front desk salespeople. In line with their business philosophy of â€œAlways, service with a smileâ€, in-house training on counter sales and telephone techniques were prioritised. The reigning Miss Hong Kong, Ms Pauline Yeung, was invited to officiate Chan Brothers Travel's 1988 in-house courtesy campaign which aimed to promote the importance of courtesy in the service industry.

Chan Brothers Travel's heavy emphasis on its people serves as a reminder of the irreplaceable human element of engaging brick-and-mortar travel agencies. Even if online travel agencies (OTAs) can complete the same tasks that brick-and-mortar travel agencies can, they arguably cannot replicate the personalised, real-world customer experience that the latter excels in. 
The start of post-pandemic travel spells exciting opportunities for tour agencies like Chan Brothers Travel which have been directly affected by global travel restrictions. For travellers who are unconfident about navigating the hodgepodge of COVID-19 guidelines, the services of brick-and-mortar tour agencies may prove immensely valuable.

Chek Jawa, on the eastern point of Pulau Ubin, was a kampong area and a little-known wetland of natural beauty which faced potential land reclamation. Its evolution to one of Singapore's most well-known environmental treasures is the result of a framework of collaboration and negotiation that underlies environmental conservation efforts in Singapore.

  The recent launch of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, an ambitious set of actions and targets for mainstream sustainable development across the nation, has put our natural environment firmly at the centre of Singapore's decision making and urban planning.1 Its announcement comes at a time of increased public interest and debate about the future of our environment in the face of development. National debates over the future of green spaces such as the Dover and Clementi Forest show that many members of the public are deeply invested in protecting our natural surroundings.
Intense interest in our environment is not new. In Singapore's context, this has been shaped by decades of work by nature advocates from civil society, working together with the public sector to navigate difficult trade-offs and dilemmas in land-use planning. The contours of this evolving dialogue between different environmental stakeholders in Singapore can be traced in the post-independence histories of our island's various green spaces.

Chek Jawa, on the eastern point of Pulau Ubin, is an illustrative case study. It was a kampong area and a little-known wetland of natural beauty which faced potential land reclamation. Its evolution to one of Singapore's most well-known environmental treasures is the result of a framework of collaboration and negotiation that underlies environmental conservation efforts in Singapore.

Saving Chek Jawa
The 100-hectare Chek Jawa is a rare spot along Singapore's coastline because of its biological diversity. From just one spot on the Chek Jawa boardwalk, one can see mangroves, seagrass meadows, mud flats, sand flats, coastal forest, and rainforest.
However, these rich habitats were once in danger of being destroyed. In 1992, three decades after independence, reclamation plans for Pulau Ubin's eastern coastline were drawn up with talks of future housing towns as well as a potential Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) link.2 Later, these plans were earmarked in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 1998, and announcements were made in 2001 that the reclamation would proceed.3 But on 20 December 2001, days before reclamation was due to begin, the Ministry of National Development formally announced the deferment of these plans.4 No doubt this deferment came with substantial trade-offs, as it meant giving up an area of land â€œthe equivalent of five Bishan parksâ€.5 So what transpired to cause a change in this planning decision?

Decisions changed in part because of academic and civil society efforts to highlight Chek Jawa's unique biodiversity. When news of the reclamation emerged, these groups used the opportunity to document the soon-to-be-lost biodiversity and to relocate flora and fauna to other locations.6 The fate of Chek Jawa began to receive significant public and media attention, with over 1,000 people visiting the mudflats to see its biodiversity for what was thought to be the last time.7 One of Singapore's most passionate nature advocates was Mr Subaraj Rajathurai, who was involved in the efforts to save Chek Jawa. In his 2018 oral history recollections with the National Archives of Singapore, Subaraj highlighted that the most important stakeholder was the general public, because of their passion and their support for Ubin's threatened coastline. He went as far as to say, â€œChek Jawa [was] the first nature area to be saved by the publicâ€.8
The government, however, also played an important part in protecting Chek Jawa. Then-Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan himself visited the site in October 2001 and met representatives from academia, civil society and the public.9 When the deferment of reclamation plans was announced, the National Parks Board (NParks) set up a committee comprising representatives of Nature Society (Singapore), the then-Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, and other experts, to work out how to best preserve Chek Jawa's ecosystem.10 This was especially vital given the crowds of people excited to visit the wetland, potentially damaging the very site which the public was lobbying to protect.
Tangible and Intangible Value
Recognition of Chek Jawa's importance has grown over the years. In terms of biodiversity, it is home to numerous species. These include a unique combination of mangrove and seagrass plants, including the globally rare seagrass Halophila beccarii, which is critically endangered in Singapore. A number of animals also call Chek Jawa home, including crabs, otters, and mudskippersâ€”a special type of amphibious fish that can survive both in and out of water.

But Chek Jawa is more than just a reservoir of biodiversity, as its coastal habitats help people too. They protect our shorelines, trap pollutants in their soils and suck up our greenhouse gas emissions. Cumulatively, the mangroves and seagrasses of Chek Jawa store the equivalent of 1,824 tons and 506 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare respectively.11 It is no wonder then that Chek Jawa is famous internationally as a site of immense scientific value and interest.12

Chek Jawa is also culturally important. It is a key recreation spot, offering respite to inhabitants of densely urban Singapore. Recreation improves our health and wellbeing and brings concrete economic benefits to the livelihoods of Ubin residents. Chek Jawa also has important cultural value, particularly for former residents of Kampong Chek Jawa.
Coming Together
While the benefits provided by Chek Jawa are well recognised, some challenges to securing its future still remain. The option for development still exists in the long run, as suggested by the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2019.13 Oil spills and other sources of pollution have the potential to impact Chek Jawa and its biodiversity.14 And as with many coastlines around the world, there are concerns about how our coastal ecosystems may respond to the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise.

In balance, though, the future of Chek Jawa appears to be bright, because the conditions that led to the original protection of Chek Jawa are even stronger todayâ€”which is a legacy of collaboration between diverse stakeholders.
For example, the Friends of Ubin Network comprises a passionate group of volunteers representing the nature and heritage communities, Ubin villagers and academics supported by the government; together, they help ensure the sustainable and sensitive use of the island.15 Similarly, the Restore Ubin Mangroves initiative brings together nature enthusiasts, fish farmers and academics working with NParks to advocate for mangrove restoration opportunities.16

Ultimately, natural spaces such as Chek Jawa are more than just ecological jewels. They are places for various communities and stakeholders in Singapore to come together towards a common goal. They represent a record of how our interactions with and valuing of nature have changed over the decades, and are a guide to how we can continue to create a more sustainable Singapore into the future.

The Orang Seletar are seafaring nomads who once roamed the rivers and wetlands of both Singapore's northern shore and present-day Malaysia's southern coastline. Like many indigenous communities around the world, the Orang Seletar possess a symbiotic relationship with the natural environment.

The late morning currents are in my favour as I steer my paddleboard towards Sungei Simpang, a river on Singapore's northern coast. I had started out from the sandy beaches of Sembawang Park, and Sungei Simpang offers a drastically different scenery. Its banks are lined by mangrove swamps with a biologically diverse ecosystem. A heron, a kingfisher, two wild dogs, several jellyfish, and countless crabs are some of the animals I encounter. Born and raised in post-independence Singapore's concrete jungle, I am unaccustomed to the sights, sounds and smells that make up this lush and verdant intertidal zone. It is at this point that I muse: how I wish that I possess the wisdom of the Orang Seletar, who once inhabited these waters.

For centuries, the Orang Seletar have called the Tebrau Straitâ€”the thin maritime boundary that separates mainland Singapore and Peninsular Malaysiaâ€”their home.1 As seafaring nomads, they once roamed the rivers and wetlands of both Singapore's northern shore and present-day Malaysia's southern coastline. Indeed, they are one of several indigenous Orang Laut (meaning â€˜sea people' in Malay) communities which trace their roots to Singapore's pre-colonial lands and waters, with each possessing a distinct culture and territorial occupancy. These communities include the Orang Gelam, who lived along the Singapore River, and the Orang Biduanda Kallang at the Kallang River. When Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore in 1819, he noted that the Orang Laut made up the bulk of the island's 1,000 inhabitants. This included 200 Orang Seletar.2

Like many indigenous communities around the world, the Orang Seletar possess a symbiotic relationship with the natural environment. For generations, they lived in mangrove forests and riverine zones, allowing them to acquire a robust system of knowledge about wild animals and plants, which provided them with crucial resources for their daily needs. They foraged for food such as tubers and wild yams, used handmade spears to catch fish, and hunted for wild pigs with the help of dogs.3 In the mangrove estuaries, they sourced for wood from tall timber-producing trees such as meranti and seraya to build their pau kajang, or houseboats. Designed with thatched roofs made of mengkuang (pandan) leaves, these boats were mobile homes in which Orang Seletar slept, cooked, played, and travelled.4 They were also experts in medicinal plants.

Between 2018 and 2019, I interviewed several members of the Orang Seletar community currently living in Johor Bahru as part of an oral history project. Letih, a community elder, told me that they still apply ground nyirih (a species of mangrove in the mahogany family) to the umbilical cord of newborns as a natural antiseptic, allowing the stump to fall off within three days.5 Interestingly, despite having been practised by generations of Orang Seletar, this method is not viewed favourably by hospitals today. Letih said, â€œNurse[s] [will] get angry. When we see the nurse coming, we will wash off the nyirih. We will clean it up. When the nurse walks away, we will apply it again [on the stump].â€6 This anecdote gives us food for thought about how indigenous knowledge is perceived in present-day medical settings.

While the Orang Seletar continue to depend on the environment for their survival, they remain conscious about not exploiting it. From my interactions with them, I have observed that their reverential attitude towards nature stems partly from the belief that spirits inhabit the natural world. To appease these unseen beings, they take precautions against extracting more resources than needed, opting to live within nature's bounds. For instance, even today, they will let go of animals caught if they do not intend to eat them. During another interview, Jefree, who is an Orang Seletar fisherman, tour guide, and photographer, said, â€œA fisherman will not kill a dolphin using his spear if he does not want to eat it. He will let it go. Following the Orang Seletar tradition, he will let go of the dolphin so that it will bless him [with bountiful catches].â€7 Their way of living is thus a truly sustainable one, in which nature, rather than human beings, dictates everyday rhythms of growth and decline. Nature, here, is not a force to be wrestled with, but a precarious equilibrium of which man is but one part.8

  Alongside many other communities whose lives were transformed by modern conceptions of statehood, the Orang Seletar found their nomadic lifestyle drastically altered in the 20th century. A major turning point was the separation of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965. With the establishment of borders between the two nations, the Orang Seletar were eventually no longer able to travel freely on their pau kajang across the Tebrau Strait. Interestingly, Orang Seletar who became Malaysian citizens were still given permission to cross the Strait until 1987.9 However, all access ceased after the arrest of an Orang Seletar who was caught allegedly smuggling illegal goods.10Many Orang Seletar who still inhabit coastal villages in Johor now make a living by fishing and rearing mussels, though their catches have been dwindling in recent years due to environmental degradation. Their fibre boats provide them easy access to what is left of Johor's mangrove swamps, which remain untouched by land reclamation and urban development for now.

  In Singapore, the Orang Seletar lived in various coastal settlements at the mouth of the Kranji and Kadut rivers and on Seletar Island during our early post-independence years. When these areas were slated for development, some moved up north to Johor. Others eventually assimilated into the local Malay community, leaving behind their seafaring and boat-dwelling lifestyle.11 What remains are various toponyms which contain their namesake, such as Seletar Reservoir, Seletar Aerospace Park and Seletar River.

  As I paddled away from the swamps of Sungei Simpang back to Sembawang Park, I caught sight of Seletar Island. This was one of the places where the Orang Seletar used to gather, docking their pau kajang side by side along the shores. I looked around me and saw other outdoor enthusiasts. Paddleboards, kayaks, and speedboats have replaced the sights of pau kajang that used to ply these waters. It is encouraging to observe urban dwellers still find ourselves wanting to be in nature. We may not be as intimately connected with the natural world as the Orang Seletar, but perhaps being regularly in touch with the waters that surround our island-nation could be a good start.

Until as recently as the mid-1980s, over a million pigs were raised annually in farms across Singapore, producing almost all the pork Singaporeans consumed.4 Evolving government policies, however, eventually determined that such self-sufficiency was not sustainable. The local pork industry came at the expense of other aspects of the country's development, and was thus gradually phased out.

  In bak chor mee, babi pongteh, and Korean barbecues. In restaurants, hawker centres, and kopitiams. In 2020 alone, Singapore consumed 123,625 tonnes of pork, making it the most popular red meat in the country.1 Yet none of this pork was raised locally, because there have been no pig farms in Singapore since 1989.2 The pork Singaporeans eat today comes either chilled, frozen, or fresh from over 20 different countries.3 Today, the only pigs left in Singapore are wild boars which roam the forested fringes of the island. Occasionally, these animals drift closer to human habitats, surfacing on social media and newspaper articles.

Today, the only pigs left in Singapore are wild boars which roam the forested fringes of the island. Occasionally, these animals drift closer to human habitats, surfacing on social media and newspaper articles.
Yet until as recently as the mid-1980s, over a million pigs were raised annually in farms across Singapore, producing almost all the pork Singaporeans consumed.4 Evolving government policies, however, eventually determined that such self-sufficiency was not sustainable. The local pork industry, though tremendously efficient, came at the expense of other aspects of the country's development, and was thus gradually phased out.
Over the decades, Singapore's policymakers have had to balance the varying, sometimes conflicting demands of multiple stakeholders, so as to ensure that different aspects of Singapore's socioeconomic growth could be managed. The local pork industry was one such area in which disparate concerns about economic viability and environmental impact intertwined, resulting in policy changes that markedly transformed how Singaporeans obtained and consumed this protein. This short essay thus surveys how changing sustainability considerations since the 1960s affected pig farming in Singapore, leading ultimately to the imported pork Singaporeans consume today.

The 1960s: Food Self-sufficiency
As compared to the present, Singapore in 1965 resembled a different country. Sprawling expanses of farmland supported large rural communities, and pig farms dotted the banks of the Kranji and Kallang rivers.
To help meet Singapore's growing food needs, the then-Primary Production Department (PPD) set out to improve the efficiency of existing farms with better education and equipment.5 Lectures and study trips were organised, while high-quality pig breeds and feedstock were provided to farmers.6 In 1965, Singapore's first farm school was established in Sembawang.7
Taken together, these efforts saved the country â€œmillions of dollars in foreign exchangeâ€ by minimising the need to purchase imported pork.8 But changes were on the horizon. Competing national priorities meant that even efficient, small-scale farming could not be sustained in the long run.
The 1970s: Competing Priorities
By the early 1970s, dramatic changes were occurring in Singapore's society, economy, and environment. In particular, Singapore's meteoric economic growth had begun generating tensions and trade-offs. Balanced against other national priorities, pig farming in Singapore had to be reorganised. Farmland shrank to make room for new factories, housing estates, and military training grounds.
â€œWe had about 6000 pigs before moving over here from Ang Mo Kio. But with various facilities provided to us, we have an additional 4000 pigs now, after only about half a year of resettlement.â€
-Tan Hong Chuay, owner of 3.25 â€“hectare farm with about 10,000 pigs, in a 1977 interview with New Nation9
Meanwhile, to improve Singapore's water security, large waterways like the Kranji River were dammed to create reservoirs. Large farms in water catchment areas such as Lim Chu Kang, Jurong, and Seletar were relocated to newly-created farming estates in Tampines, Punggol, and Jalan Kayu to prevent pig waste from contaminating new freshwater sources. Small-scale pig farmers were encouraged to raise less pollutive livestock, or to give up farming entirely.10 The era of intensive farming had arrived.

Punggol Pork
One of the government's most ambitious experiments in intensive farming during this period was its development of the Punggol pig-farming district. Over 1,000 hectares of land was allocated to this venture. Electric cables and water pipes were laid, new roads were built, and government flats constructed to house resettled farmers.11 The Punggol Pig Centre, a laboratory specialising in pig diseases and pig farm management, was also established in Jalan Serangoon Kechil.12
By 1977, the newly resettled pig farms in Punggol had considerably exceeded production targets despite the decrease in available farmland. The PPD declared Singapore â€œself-sufficient in pigsâ€.13 Intensifying pig farming with modern technologies had allowed for more efficient, sustainable use of resources. By September 1980, Singaporean farms were producing over 1.25 million pigs annually.14 Despite these improved efficiencies, however, changes were soon afoot again. The 1980s would bring new choices and challenges.
â€œDoes it make sense to spend some $80 million on waste treatment plants to achieve poor environmental standards? If pig farms have eventually to go, why prolong the agony?â€
-Dr Goh Keng Swee, in response to a question filed in Parliament in 198415

The 1980s: The End of Singaporean Pork
Despite the local pork industry's high production output, policymakers by the early 1980s determined that pig farming was unsustainable when balanced against other aspects of national development.
In March 1984, Dr Goh Keng Swee, First Deputy Prime Minister, announced that all local pig farms would be progressively phased out. All of Singapore's pork would henceforth be imported.16
â€œWhen they mentioned that they wanted to phase out the pig farming, everybody was furious â€¦ it really hit the farmers who are about 40, 50 years old â€¦ when they are at this stage, you know, to tell them to go out and do other business, it's not easy.
My farm? We had to accept it, unwillingly, unfortunately. But that was the government policy, so we had to stop.â€
-Hay Soo Kheng, a pig farmer, in a 1991 interview with the National Archives of Singapore17
After â€œa major review of pig policyâ€, the state had concluded that the extreme toxicity of pig waste, expensive waste treatment plants, and the resource-intensive nature of pig farming in general made it economically and environmentally unsustainable in the long run. It would be efficient, the government argued, to â€œsupply the whole of our pork requirements through imports, probably at a lower costâ€.18

The decision had been made at the highest levels of government, who brooked no protest to this difficult decision.19 Despite widespread disappointment from farmers and even some PPD officers, the reaction to this decision amongst most Singaporeans appeared to have been relatively muted.
The ambivalent response might have been a product of broader shifts in Singapore's economy. Many small farmers had already been transiting out of the pork industry for years, farming other crops, or exploring other livelihoods due to diminishing state support for pig farming.

For instance, stuck with excess pigs in his farms, Mr Lim Hock Chee turned to selling chilled pork from a rented booth in a Savewell Supermarket outlet at Ang Mo Kio in 1984, and was later able to take over the management of the entire store. The decision marked the beginning of the Sheng Siong supermarkets, which has today grown to an island wide chain of 61 outlets.20
â€œNow I'm 55. I have been farming since I was 18. What other work can I do â€¦ The happiest thing in my life is that I have raised eight children and I don't owe anybody any money â€¦ That's not bad, isn't it, considering I never learnt to read and write?â€
-Poh Ah Leck, owner of a small family-run pig farm, in a 1985 interview with The Straits Times21
After phasing out pig farms, the Government was not idle either. In addition to the monumental task of closing down local farms, PPD officials fanned out throughout the region, seeking suppliers in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia. New infrastructures were built to transport and market fresh, chilled, and frozen pork locally. Publicity campaigns encouraged Singaporeans to consume more imported pork.

â€˜It is not economical to sell them off because transportation costs for such a small lot exceed any profits to be made,' he said.
â€˜The female pigs are already old. There is no point trying to sell the piglets off because farms in Punggol, Tampines, Changi and Sembawang are being closed at the same time and the market will be flooded,' he added.â€

The era of Singaporean pork was over. Henceforth, Singaporeans (with initial reluctance) would begin consuming pork, grown in overseas farms, in increasing quantities.

Singapore, Swine, and Sustainability
The story of Singaporean pork illustrates how stark choices had to be made in Singapore's early nation-building years, as leaders and citizens alike strove to balance economic imperatives with growing concerns about environmental sustainability. Entwined with these grand narratives of national progress are hence also smaller stories of sacrifice, uncertainty, and loss.
Yet policymakers and pig farmers alike met these challenges with tireless determination and bold ingenuity, reinventing themselves to meet evolving contexts. History cannot predict the future, but perhaps this brief story of swine and sustainability shows us how we can likewise rise to meet the road ahead: with grit, daring, and imagination.

In the 1960s, Singapore embarked on a rigorous industrialisation programme to boost economic development. As public housing became located closer to industrial areas, residents complained about pollution such as smoke, dust, and fumes that came from the factories. In 1970, the Anti-Pollution Unit was established with a focus on curbing air pollution, ultimately aiming to play a preventive rather than retroactive role.

  My evening runs through Jurong take me through a network of factories. There is an oil refinery a few kilometres away, with Jurong Island located just beyond. Yet the sky here is no less blue than in any other neighbourhood, with no fewer birds or trees. This clean air, however, belies Singapore's heavy reliance on industrialisation which has powered our economy since the 1960s. In fact, it is a testament to careful planning right from the early stages of Singapore's post-independence development.

A clue to these early plans lies in the former office of Singapore's founding Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. Near his desk, a cabinet houses a series of large, detailed maps. One map, titled â€œExisting and Future Areas Subject to Pollutionâ€, dates to the early 1970s and indicates existing and expected sites of pollution in Singapore such as Jurong and Sembawang. The fact that this map was drawn up and hung in Mr Lee's office indicates that the issue mattered greatly to him, even during the initial stages of Singapore's industrialisation. What prompted this focus on pollution, and what was done about it? This article explores how Singapore approached and tackled this environmental challenge during our early nation-building years through the establishment of the Anti-Pollution Unit.

Anti-Pollution Unit: The Beginning
In the 1960s, Singapore embarked on a rigorous industrialisation programme to boost economic development. As public housing became located closer to industrial areas, residents complained about pollution such as smoke, dust, and fumes that came from the factories. At that time, the responsibility of enforcement was divided among two departments, the Public Health Engineering Branch and Environmental Health Department. However, existing guidelines to address air pollution were vague and regulation were ineffective.1
In February 1970, the government invited World Health Organisation consultant Graham Cleary to Singapore to assess the situation and recommend an action plan. His recommendations included establishing a specialised Air Pollution Unit, developing legislation for air pollution control and factoring air pollution considerations into urban planning.2
Although air pollution levels in Singapore were generally within global standards and lower than other industrialised cities, there would be problems down the road if prevailing growth rates were maintained.3 Lee Ek Tieng, the first Head of the newly established Anti-Pollution Unit (APU), recalled then-Prime Minister Lee being â€œvery concernedâ€ about the pollutive impact of industrialisation after having read Cleary's report. Within two months of Cleary setting foot in Singapore, APU was established under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) before formally gaining Parliament's stamp of approval the year after.4

With other reforms to tackle land and water pollution such as the Environmental Public Health Act, the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act, and even the â€œKeep Singapore Cleanâ€ campaign, APU focused on curbing air pollution, ultimately aiming to play a preventive rather than retroactive role. Tan Guong Ching, who started his public service career in APU as an engineer, later commented: â€œIf we had not placed our control measures right from the very beginning, Singapore would have been a totally different placeâ€”a very polluted place.â€5
â€œI was looking out of my office window at Pearl's Hill one day and I thought the rains were coming. But on taking a closer look, I realised that the murkiness was smog â€¦ I asked myself: if Singapore did not take this thing in hand now, what would happen in the future?â€
Lim Kim San, Singapore's first Minister for the Environment, as quoted in Forging a Greener Tomorrow
Finding Their Way
As tackling industrial pollution was just in its early stages worldwide, little research data was available, especially for tropical climates like Singapore's. The Unit thus had to conduct its own experiments to measure the impact of air pollution here and find its own solutions. For instance, it needed to find out whether temperature inversionsâ€”a phenomenon where cold air is trapped under warmer air, keeping pollutive particles trapped as wellâ€”occurred at night in Singapore, as in temperate climates. To measure this, the team attached temperature sensors along the chimney of the Senoko Power Station in Sembawang, day and night. They found that temperature inversions did indeed occur in Singapore, and revised the guidelines for chimney heights to ensure that any pollutive emissions would not remain trapped.7 While APU's methods were initially manual and rudimentary, Joseph Hui, who joined APU as an engineer in 1977 and eventually became Deputy CEO of the National Environment Agency, remarked that being closer to the ground gave the team â€œa sense of satisfaction for being able to protect the environmentâ€.8

The team also relied strongly on the global community to build up its expertise. As the first head of APU, Lee Ek Tieng completed a seven-month attachment in New Zealand and Australia in 1970 before returning to assume his position full-time. Subsequently, Singapore continued to engage these two nations closely, and as the three countries engaged in mutual dialogue, solutions such as new pollution control technology were jointly developed.9
Standing Their Ground
Having consulted advisors and gathered data, APU prepared to implement new anti-polluting regulations. Although these measures were unpopular with many investors and firms, the authority accorded to APU as an agency under PMO's ambit enabled it to stand its ground.
Before proper legislation was introduced, APU had sought assistance from other departments such as the Ministry of Labour and Registry of Vehicles to manage emissions; however, enforcement often seemed like a â€œcat-and-mouse gameâ€ due to polluters' evasive tactics and shortage of regulatory staff.10 The Clean Air Act and Clean Air (Standards) Regulations, passed in 1971 and 1972 respectively, subsequently gave the Unit greater power. APU would screen all factories with potentially pollutive impact before allowing them to operate, and industries whose pollutive risk was too great were turned down. For example, an attractive offer by an Australian firm to set up an iron and steel plant was rejected. Existing factories also had to comply with new regulations by installing pollution control equipment such as venturi scrubbers, or by changing practices such as inefficient combustion techniques and pollutive waste management methods.11
To keep residential neighbourhoods pollution-free, APU also developed a zoning system that sorted industries according to their pollutive impactâ€”a new strategy that was subsequently implemented by other countries.12 Industries were categorised by indices that evaluated the amount of noise generated, the pollution potentially produced and the type of equipment involved. â€œLight Industriesâ€ that did not create air, water, or noise pollution could be situated near homes, while â€œSpecial Industriesâ€â€”which ranged from the manufacture of ceramic tiles to petroleum refineriesâ€”faced pollution control measures and were situated in dedicated zones.13 Some existing factories were forced to relocate, but the advantage was that those with outdated equipment moved into newer premises with better pollution control facilities.14
On how companies reacted to APU's guidelines, Tan Guong Ching recalled in an interview with the Founders' Memorial: â€œOf course they didn't like it. It meant cost to them.â€15 Indeed, the new measures were an impediment to foreign investment and some industries moved out of Singapore altogether. Still, then-Minister for the Environment Lim Kim San understood that the costs of pollution could be even greater than the economic benefit from these investments.16

The fact that APU reported directly to the Prime Minister also gave it the authority needed for enforcement. In an interview with the National Archives of Singapore, Lee Ek Tieng recounted an incident where a large petrochemical company, upon needing to install a ground flare system for pollution control, â€œcomplained to everybody, every ministerâ€¦ they even appealed to Goh Keng Swee.â€ Lee added, â€œGoh Keng Swee was very clever, left it to the Prime Minister. That was it. And they never got away. They finally had to put a ground flare.â€17
â€œActually environmental pollution was quite a new topic â€¦ we were among the pioneers of pollution control. So we had a lot of, shall I say, experimentation â€¦ we thought through the problems and solutions ourselves.â€ 
- Tan Guong Ching, in a 2007 interview with the National Archives of Singapore18

â€œWe are here interested in prevention before the situation gets out of hand â€¦ It is therefore not pre-mature to control air pollution now as some people think it is in Singapore. Industrialists and other polluters must think and accept that air pollution control is part of their responsibility.â€

Conclusion
APU's establishment in 1970 marked the beginning of greater environmental awareness and action in Singapore. In 1972, Singapore became one of the first countries in the world to form a ministry dedicated to the environment, under which APU was eventually subsumed in 1983.20
In Singapore's early post-independence years, environmental protection was more about understanding the impact of pollutive activity and keeping these effects at bay. Recent conversations have moved towards the protection of wildlife and nature from human activity and the sustainable use of resources. While Singapore today looks to greening and reducing overall environmental impact, APU's spirit of experimentation and collaboration remains ever-relevant. The Unit's persistence in implementing anti-pollution measures paid off in the clean environment we enjoy today; similarly, one can expect the present generation's commitment to furthering environmental consciousness to have a palpable impact on our future.

  Strolling along the Singapore River, with a view of its placid waters contrasting against the lively waterside establishments, one is hard-pressed to imagine the waterway's filthy past. Indeed, the clean-up of the Singapore River has long been held up as an example of the Republic's transformation and its commitment to sustainable development. Now, the riverine scenery is a dynamic combination of old and new, with historic features being adaptively re-used in a thriving leisure and entertainment scene.

The Singapore River clean-up is inseparable from the greater plan to modernise Singapore in its post-independence years, unfolding in tandem with state planning initiatives such as the development of public housing. The clean-up's origins can be traced back to 1969, when then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew tasked the Public Works Department and Public Utilities Board to come up with a plan to clean up Singapore's major waterways.1 Following this, there were some initial studies and proposals by individual government agencies, but the ball really got rolling in 1977, after a speech Mr Lee gave at the opening ceremony of Upper Peirce Reservoir, where he gave the Ministry of Environment a 10-year target to clean up the Singapore River and Kallang Basin.2

â€œThe day we achieve that [clean river], whoever has been in charge for the last ten years or for the next ten years, if I am still around, I will give each one of themâ€”both the Minister, the Permanent Secretary and the head of departmentâ€”a real solid gold medal, one troy ounce (31.1 grams).â€

The pace of the clean-up then picked up. In and around the river, sources of pollutionâ€”contributing to garbage, sewage, and industrial wasteâ€”were removed. Over 10 years, more than 46,000 squatters in the Singapore River and Kallang Basin were relocated to public housing, and nearly 5,000 hawkers were asked to move to hawker centres.
The clean-up was officially declared complete on 2 September 1987. As part of the Clean Rivers Commemoration, a five-day carnival held at Marina Bay, Mr Lee presented gold medals to 10 people for their contributions.5

Today, the Singapore River flows through several rejuvenated precincts including the Civic District and the Central Business District. The river ends in Singapore's largest reservoir, the Marina Reservoir, with a massive dam across the Marina channel that was completed in 2008.
Transformative as the clean-up may be, there are those who have noted the human costs of this process of urban renewal. Historian Stephen Dobbs has chronicled the hardships of lighter operators who were evicted from the river to upgraded facilities at Pasir Panjang over the course of the cleanup.6 Other cultural commentators have lamentedthe loss of the Singapore River's place identity. Singaporean poet Lee Tzu Pheng wrote in her much anthologised poem, Singapore River: â€œThe operation was massive;/ designed to give new life to the old lady./ We cleaned out/ her arteries, removed/ detritus and silt,/ created a by-pass/ for the old blood./ Now you can hardly tell/ her historyâ€.7

These losses, arguably, are outweighed by gains in other quarters, such as massive improvements in sanitation and safety. There are also other positive ecological outcomes. Overall, the city-state's cleaner waterways have become attractive habitats for wildlife, attracting species previously rare in Singapore, such as otters.
Ultimately, what the Singapore River story shows is that pursuing sustainable development often involves altering the social fabric of a place. Nevertheless, the river's past is never completely cut off, as shown in the conserved buildings lining its banks. Another way the river's history can be kept alive is in the memories of those who encountered it back then. In closing, this essay ends with the accounts of those who have experienced the river at different times. Indirectly, these rich stories chart the river's evolution and reflect the myriad facets of these waters.

  From 1962 to 1963, I was attached to the Marine Police department at Clifford Pier and worked
as a police constable in a patrol boat. The river was very busy with tongkangs, sampans, lighters, and bumboats. We had to check that there were no laws broken on the boats. Sometimes, we encountered workers smoking opium in the lighters, and sometimes bumboats were caught with stolen goods of illegal alcohol and cigarettes. We were not tasked to police people dirtying the river, which had a lot of rubbish, especially food waste from hawkers and customers. The water was then very polluted and smelly.

  From the 1930s to the 1970s, my maternal great-grandfather ran an import-export business
at the junction of Hill Street and North Boat Quay called Hua Seng. The company managed the
loading and unloading of goods from the riverboats to the warehouses along the Singapore
River. The river was a very busy place, with coolies carrying goods from boat to shore, balancing on thin planks with heavy sacks on their backs.

  The smell of the river was quite bad, like a sewer. The water was murky and dirty and often one could see animal carcasses floating by. On the opposite bank were shophouses that stored foodstuff on the ground floors and provided accommodation on the second or third floor. To protect the food items from rats, the shophouse owners kept pythons as pets on the ground floor.

Kampong Pasir Panjang (1965) from the National Gallery Collection is a watercolour drawing by Idris Mohamed Ali (1944â€“). Idris began painting at the age of 10. Unable to afford formal art training, he learnt from books, observation, practice and a brief tutelage under pioneer Malay artist, S. Mahdar. Famous for his watercolour landscapes and street scenes, Idris's drawings of old Singapore serve as important historical documents. This work depicts Kampong Pasir Panjang (Pasir Panjang Village), which no longer exists today.

The watercolour drawing was found fully adhered to a piece of backing paper with glue and secured to a non-archival matboard using our favourite household repair itemâ€”the adhesive tape. This disastrous combination prevented the drawing from expanding and contracting evenly when the environmental humidity fluctuated, thus causing â€˜wrinkles' (undulation) to form. To reduce this stress and improve the overall aesthetics, the matboard was removed and the adhesive softened with moisture to carefully remove the backing paper from the drawing.

This drawing was particularly memorable because not oneâ€”but twoâ€”hidden watercolour drawings were discovered during treatment! One was found on the back of Kampong Pasir Panjang (untitled and undated) and the other on the backing paper, titled Alley Singapore and dated 1989. This brought back fond memories of the Kinder Surprise chocolateâ€”the joy of discovering the toy hidden within the chocolate shell. Moments like these are rewarding, and I feel privileged to be part of the conservation field, being able to uncover the secrets and stories behind the precious objects under our care.

This baju panjang (Indonesian for â€˜long dress') from the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) Collection dates to around 1725â€“50 from South Sumatra. The Malay baju panjang is a long, loose coat once popular with both men and women. It relates to the Indo-Arabic banyan worn by  Gujarati merchants and later became popular with Europeans. Malay popular tradition holds that the baju panjang was introduced with the arrival of Islam in the Malay World, which saw a more modest form of dress.
  After treatment, a cushion mount and collar support were customised for the garment's display. Though creases remain, they have been relaxed and the collar is now better supported. Baju Panjang, South Sumatra, Indonesia, c. 1725-50, Collection of Asian Civilisation Museum
The baju panjang shown here was fashioned from Indian trade cotton imported from the Coromandel Coast, resist-dyed and hand-painted with fine floral motifs. Though the garment appeared complete, a closer inspection revealed many stains, tears, holes and patch repairs. The repairs made using a similar fabric were likely done by the garment's owner, suggesting that this garment had been cherished and worn frequently. However, these repairs have also altered the garment's silhouette, resulting in areas with permanent creasing. To reduce stress on the creased fibres and to improve the look of the garment, creases were relaxed with a cool mist before being flattened under glass weights.
  Many small repairs were made in this area. These repairs were likely carried out by the owner, suggesting that this garment had been cherished and worn frequently. Baju Panjang, South Sumatra, Indonesia, c. 1725-50, Collection of Asian Civilisation Museum
A cushion mount was customised for the garment's display. Though its distorted silhouette proved challenging as creasing could not be avoided, modifications were made to this mount during test-fitting to minimise this. A separate support for the collar was also created.
  A larger repair can be seen in this image alongside a crease that may have been caused by itâ€”can you see it? (Lighting for the image differs here as a raking light was used to highlight the creasing.) Baju Panjang, South Sumatra, Indonesia, c. 1725-50, Collection of Asian Civilisation Museum
This garment reminded me how privileged we are as conservators, working with artefacts that have so many stories to tell. This garment was particularly memorable because its physical condition shares with us a very human experience: the care we take with the things that are precious to us. This baju panjang is currently on display at ACM's Fashion Gallery.

  In 2020, the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) received a gift of Philippine jewellery from the Montilla clan, one of the earliest settler families in Negros Occidental, Philippines. Handed down four generations, this is a significant donation as it furthers ACM's mission in promoting cross-cultural art and sheds light on centuries of goldsmithing and trade in the Philippines.
The Montilla Clan
  Josefa Jordan Ortaliz (birth and death unknown) was the daughter-in-law of the family's patriarch, Agustin Orendain Montilla (1802â€“?), a Philippine-born Spaniard who married Vicenta Locsin-Zarandin Yanson (1807â€“?), a mestiza from Iloilo.1 Ortaliz bequeathed her jewels to her eldest daughter, Lina Ortaliz Montilla (1868â€“1939), and she thence to her daughters, Lilia Montilla y Montilla (1901â€“83) and Lina Juana Montilla y Montilla (1906â€“85).
  (Fig. 2) Lina Ortaliz Montilla (1868â€“1939) and her first cousin and husband Candido Montilla (1871â€“1943). Philippines, circa 1931. Photograph. Private collection.
From the Montilla sisters, the jewels were passed down to their niece, Corazon Arroyo Montilla (1933â€“2021). Separately, a pair of diamond earrings were gifted to Corazon for her high school graduation from her grandaunt DoÃ±a Leoncia Lacson y Torres (1903â€“81). The latter had received the earrings from her father, General Aniceto Lacson y Ledesma (1857â€“1931), who served as president of the shortlived Republic of Negros in 1899.
  Agustin Orendain Montilla relocated to Negros Island from Manila to set up an agricultural settlement in Pulupandan. He grew a variety of crops, including rice, abaca and maize, and later became one of the first to produce sugar on a commercial scale in the Philippines.2 Negros Island became a dominant player in the world's sugar economy in the 19th century.

Composed of thousands of islands, the cultural fabric of the Philippines is diverse. The Negrenses from Negros Island are proud of their distinct culture and language. On the island, two main languages (different from Tagalog) are spoken: Hiligaynon in the province of Negros Occidental (northwestern Negros Island), where the Montilla family settled; and Cebuano in Negros Oriental (southeastern Negros Island).
  Beyond Manila: Multiple Centres of Commerce
  â€œFrom China come many persons able and willing to engage in all sorts of trades and they are skilful, quick and economical. They areâ€¦ tailors, the shoemakers, and the silversmiths, the sculptorsâ€¦ and they take over all classes of work in the city.â€
â€”Fr. Pedro Chirino3
  Historically, the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean served as natural conduits for cross-cultural interaction between individuals of various faiths, cultures and occupations.4 Even before the 1521 arrival of Spanish conquistadors in the Philippines, multiple centres, such as Cebu and Iloilo (on either side of Negros Island), had been flourishing ports with developed settlements. Under Spanish rule, these centres continued to evolve due to intensified global interaction.
  From 1571 to 1815, the galleon trade made Manila's walled city, Intramuros, one of the main entrepots of the world.5 From nutmeg from the Moluccas to coral from the Mediterranean Sea, the world's luxury goods converged in Manila's multicultural trading hub, where pidgin Hokkien or pidgin Spanish with Tagalog elements developed in the course of daily encounters.6
  (Fig. 4) The Montilla ancestral home known as Balay Daku (â€˜big house' in Hiligaynon), built in 1853. Negros Island, Philippines. Photograph. Private collection.
It was against this backdrop of mercantile activity that the exchange of goods and ideas occurred. The racial hierarchy imposed under Spain's colonial rule placed Peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain) on top and Indios (indigenous inhabitants of the Philippines) at the bottom.
  However, this did not impede interactions between people of different classes and ethnic backgrounds. It was in the Parian, a Chinese-designated area outside the walled city of Manila, where the Spanish made their orders, and where itinerant artisans produced objects according to the varied tastes of customers, further fuelling artistic exchange and creativity.7
  From the 16th century, Spanish accounts have noted the impressive command of techniques by local goldsmiths. Multiple centres for jewellery production soon developed, drawing large numbers of local and foreign goldsmiths to areas beyond Manila, including Luzon Island, Damortis in the province of La Union, and Vigan and Bantay in the Ilocos Region.8
  The influx of local and itinerant smiths contributed to the hybrid nature of Philippine jewellery. The abundance of silver due to the galleon trade attracted Chinese silver artisans from Guangzhou and Fujian, where the famed Chinese silver export market had been established in the latter half of the 17th century.9
  By the 19th century, descendants of these immigrant artisans had assimilated into Philippine society, and were working in a style heavily influenced by European demand and the varying tastes of local communities.10
  Practical Liaisons: Mixed-race Marriages and Hybrid Tastes
  In the 17th to 19th centuries, travellers to Asia often recorded observations of racially hybrid communities in port cities.11 Mixed marriages such as that between Montilla and Yanson, were practical: they allowed foreign businessmen to access Asian networks and grow commercial opportunities, as the local wives could speak several languages and understand two or more cultures.12
  As â€˜cross-cultural brokers', mixed communities became indispensable in trade and politics.13 It was against this backdrop of cultural and religious mixing that indigenous communities, Christian Chinese, and mestizos of mixed Spanish, Chinese and Indios origin, developed hybrid forms of art and manners of dress.14
  (Fig. 5) Portrait of Josefa Jordan Ortaliz Montilla based on a photograph from the 1890s. Fernando Amorsolo (1892â€“1972). Philippines, 1950s. Oil on canvas. Private collection.
Josefa Jordan Ortaliz married Montilla and Yanson's oldest son, Bonifacio Yanson Montilla (birth and death unknown), in 1867.15 A portrait of Josefa based on a photograph from the 1890s shows the hybrid dress of a wealthy mestiza (Fig. 5). Notably, a large gold peineta (comb) holds her chignon in place.
  Peinetas were used until the mid-20th century, and were eventually made obsolete as shorter hairstyles became de rigueur. While tortoiseshell combs were popular in Spain by the 19th century, crescent-shaped combs are Chinese in origin, and the Spanish vogue for tortoiseshell combs was likely due to the Manila galleon trade through Spain's colonies.16 Two peinetas (see Figs. 1 and 6) worn by Ortaliz are made of gold, silver, tortoiseshell and seed pearls from the Sulu archipelago. These lavish materials reflect the resource-rich bounty of the Philippines.
  (Fig. 6) These peineta and veil hairpins illustrate the accomplished work of local goldsmiths. Peineta, Manila, Philippines, c. 1870s, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Historically, the Philippines was rich in natural resources beyond gold. Valuable sea products like tortoiseshell and pearls are indigenous to the Philippines. The hawksbill tortoise, now sadly endangered, enabled workshops in Manila to become major producers of luxury products made from tortoiseshell. The trade of pearls is likewise centuries old. As early as 1349, the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan had observed that â€œpearls from the Sulu archipelago were prized for their lasting blue-ish white colour, and traded for gold, silver and iron barsâ€.17
  The gold and silver peineta and veil hairpins (Fig. 6) illustrate the accomplished work of local goldsmiths. The undulating outlines of golden flowers and leaves reveal the remarkable ability of local craftsmen to go beyond imitating European jewellery styles, to create objects of great naturalism. During this time, botanical drawings inspired a Victorian fondness for floral and vegetal motifs. In these ornaments, the flowers and leaves capture the essence of life and movement in nature.
  (Fig. 6) These peineta and veil hairpins illustrate the accomplished work of local goldsmiths. Veil Hairpins, Manila, Philippines, c. 1870s, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Centuries of goldsmithing knowledge enabled local smiths to work in a wide range of techniques and forms, their skills and inspiration garnered from a myriad of cultures. Oblong criollas (earrings) derived their name from hoop earrings worn by Mexicans of mixed race.18
  The form of these earrings has an equally hybrid origin as they take after Spanish ear ornaments, though they originate from styles introduced to Spain by Muslim rulers (the Umayyad Caliphate was in Spain by the 10th century)â€”hoop earrings appear frequently in medieval Islamic jewellery.19 In Figure 7, we see the rare example of criollas that are each decorated with a bird holding a rice stalk in its beak (criollas embellished with floral and vegetal motifs are more common).

European Religion and Superstition in Philippine Jewellery
  In accordance with the Montilla family tradition, Ortaliz passed down her jewellery to her eldest daughter, Lina Ortaliz Montilla. The popularity of veil hairpins in the Philippines is in large part credited to the adoption of Spanish dress. They were used to secure prestige accessories like the lace paÃ±uelo (veil), which wealthy native and mestiza women wore to church as an indication of modesty, religious devotion and upper-class status.20
  Devotional jewellery played a central role in Philippine dress. Beyond religious piety, Christian ornaments indicated an allegiance to Spanish rule and luxurious ones conveyed social status. Religious jewellery from the Philippines, though taking after Spanish examples, have their own distinctive character and gradually evolved to adopt a native style.

Undoubtedly, other influencesâ€”from the Chinese, for instanceâ€”also played a key role in trade and goldsmithing in Manila.21 The centuries-long Chineseâ€“Philippine interactions are evident in how natives in the Philippines used Chinese terms for gold weight, tools and techniques long before Spanish arrival.22
  In Figure 9, we see a gold bead on the coral rosary which is decorated with stylised Chinese character å¯¿ (shou), which refers to â€˜longevity'. Jewellery with highly prized coral beads (see criollas with coral beads in Fig. 1) were a marker of luxury, and they reflect the trading port status of the Philippines. Because Manila was a doorway to the global trading world, luxury commodities like coral were made available to its wealthy residents.23

The use of llaveros (keychains) was also common throughout the Philippines, Java and the Straits Settlements. In the later decades of the 19th century, ringed key hooks modelled after European examples became fashionable.
  A popular form involves a key ring suspended from a clenched fist, referred to as figa (derived from the Latin ficum facere). It is symbolically linked with the fig and signifies life. The figa is known in various cultures throughout antiquity, among them the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Etruscans, who used this symbol as an amulet. In Spain, the figa functioned as an amulet against the evil eye and was worn by children. For grown women, the phallic shape of the figa alludes to ideas of fertility.24

A large quantity of Chinese jewellery found in the 1638 wreck of the Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la ConcepciÃ³n (a Manila galleon bound for Acapulco) includes several jewels with this clenched-fist motif. This attests to the widespread circulation of the figa motif and its global use spanning centuries. In the same way that the crescent-shaped peinetas were likely brought to Spain from China through its colonies, it is possible that the Portuguese and Spaniards introduced the figa symbol to their colonies in Southeast Asia.25
  From China to the Philippines and from Mexico to the Iberian Peninsula, networks of conquest, trade and migration impacted the cross-cultural and hybrid characteristics of Philippine jewelleryâ€”and this set of jewellery from the Montilla clan is a gleaming example of that. Unearthing the provenance of these historical gems allows us to understand the culturally fluid reality of the Philippines during the 19th and mid-20th centuries, and, no doubt, their donation to ACM will contribute greatly to the study of Philippine history and material culture.
  This article is dedicated to the memory of Corazon Arroyo Montilla who passed away on 11 June 2021.

With 80 years now behind us since the Fall of Singapore, it is timely to examine the gaps in war memory, and perhaps to look further towards postmemory to enrich current narratives.
MUSESG Volume 15 Issue 1 â€“ January 2022
Text by Iskander Mydin

  This year is the 80th anniversary of the British surrender to the Japanese army in Singapore on 15 February 1942, also known as the Fall of Singapore. Much has since been written about the Fall, though with the hindsight of 80 years, much can now also be said about what is lacking in the corpus of literature relating to war memory. Besides paying attention to the missing voices, an examination of postmemory would enrich the discourse on war memory, which is especially timely as the generation of war survivors gradually passes on.
  Transmission of Postmemory in Families
While the spotlight is often trained on the primary accounts of war survivors, there is in fact a great deal to unearth from the memories of war inherited by subsequent generations. These second-hand memories are referred to as postmemory, a term popularised by scholar Marianne Hirsch. Postmemory originally refers to the inheritance of war memories by the children of war survivors. It is applied in this article broadly to also include grandchildren of survivors. Succeeding generations negotiate with the narratives, images and behaviours of the survivors who are now gone; in turn, their own retelling of the event adds another dimension to the wealth of stories about the war, and enables them to avoid losing contact with the past.
  The transmission of war memory across generations in the family is most likely carried out through anecdotal storytellingâ€”in dialogue with another or as a cautionary tale from elder to younger. The latter then interprets and reconstructs the stories, and this provides a new layer to primary accounts. Additionally, how the stories were shared, received and treated as either meaningful or not is important in understanding how war memory is formed and sustained across time.
  A section of the Surviving Syonan permanent exhibition on the Japanese Occupation, held at the National Museum of Singapore.
The following are some examples of postmemory encounters within the family. These experiences were shared by current and past National Museum of Singapore colleagues. First, a granddaughter has a vivid memory of her grandfather revealing his ill-treatment at the hands of Japanese soldiers and forbidding his family to purchase any Japanese-made goods for use at home.
  Second, a son recalls that his father, born in the early 1950s and a football fan, would support any team playing against Japan or Germany, although he would also have some sympathy for Japan as an Asian country. He owned a Japanese-made car and the family bought Japanese household goods consistently. On the other hand, the maternal grandfather did not express any overt anti-Japanese sentiment, perhaps because he had worked for the Japanese as a driver during the war.
  Third, a grandson did not inherit any memories of the war since both his parents and grandparents did not talk about it at all. And, finally, a granddaughter has only murky recollections from her grandfather.
  Where there is little to no family transmission of war memories, the next generations are kept in the dark about what their elders might have gone through. The reasons for such exclusion may not be clearâ€”the trauma was perhaps too painful to be revisitedâ€”but the end result is a lack of awareness of the impact of war on the families. Each of these examples highlights how transmission of memories may occur (or not) and thus how they are woven into a family's biography of memories, which in turn enrich the overall tapestry of war memory in Singapore.
  After the opening of the revamped Changi Chapel and Museum and Reflections at Bukit Chandu in 2021, there were enquiries addressed to the National Museum from descendants of former wartime officers. One was from the grandson of an Indian Army officer who fought in the Battle for Singapore and later won a Military Cross for his efforts in saving the lives of other wounded officers, and another from the grandson of a Malay non-commissioned officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. With only fragmented memories to start with, both individuals were searching for more details and the personal artefacts of their grandparents' war service. Thus, the museum is drawn into the realm of postmemory.

Within the National Museum's collection are some war medals donated in the 1980s which the museum hopes to reconnect with the awardees' descendants. In this way, the museum plays a role in expanding the postmemory of families. This can be especially meaningful for those who had little to no such encounters within their household. It is hoped that continued conversations on the war would spur younger generations to dig deeper into their family history and uncover the trove of (post)memories held by their grandparents or parents.
  Contradictions of War Memory and Consumption
In the decades that followed the war, Singapore embarked on rapid industrialisation, and one of its strategies was to tap on the strengths and success of Japan's industries. This saw the entry of Japanese-made goods such as rice cookers, electric fans and transistor radios into the local market, and these products became popular in many Singaporean households.
  From the 1960s, as Singapore ramped up its economic development, Japanese-made products entered the local market. Many of these goods, such as rice cookers and cassette players, became popular household items. National brand rice cooker with original box, 1960s. NMS 2008-01550

Interestingly, a survey conducted by the Singapore Standard newspaper in 1950 on the sentiments of local residents regarding a possible return of Japanese businesses to Singapore revealed a negative reaction. It appeared that the scars of the war remained fresh and the memory of the war was still too painful to be comfortable with Japanese businesses operating in Singapore.
  Some of these commodities are now in the National Museum's collection. With the above context in mind, the contradictions that exist within the self, as well as between the people's war memory and the state's pragmatic approach to postwar economic development and international relations, are laid bare. As such, the objects gain a new interpretive layer to their biographies as museum artefacts.

  Overlooked War Memory
Under imprisonment in Changi, some prisoners of war and civilian internees documented their prison memories in the form of notebooks, sketches, diaries and so on, many of which have not been fully explored as war memory. One example comes from the surviving notebook of prisoner of war Sergeant John Ritchie Johnston, who wrote his recollections in the hope that a â€œhistory of the last days of Singaporeâ€ would come to be written.

Another example is a sketch drawn like a plaque illustrating the battle trajectory of the Royal Artillery's 122nd Field Regiment, from the regiment's opening shots in December 1941 right up to the British surrender.

These forms of war memory-from-below deserve to have their place alongside the well-known war memoirs of generals, such as Why Singapore Fell (1944) by Australian commander General Gordon Bennett and The Road to Malaya (1949) by General Arthur Percival, as well as the latter's earlier despatch published in British newspapers and in the local Straits Times in 1948.

Another category of war memory that merits greater attention is the journalism of foreign war correspondents and newspaper columnists. These include war correspondent Ian Morrison's coverage in his book Malayan Postscript (1942) written three months after the surrender; and columnist Dorothy Crisp's wartime book, Why We Lost Singapore (1943), based on interviews with serving soldiers. Reading them now is to follow their narratives of the impending collapse and to re-enact in our minds those â€œlast daysâ€, in the words of Sergeant Johnston.

  Missing Voices
Although there is a seemingly vast amount of literature on war memory, compared to the volume of published accounts by European combatants, those of non-European combatants and local volunteers are still not on the same scale. In particular, notwithstanding some historians' efforts to highlight the contributions of Indian Army contingents to the British war effort,1 the war memory of Indian Army soldiers in Singapore, who formed the largest contingent of Allied troops, has not been adequately covered.
  The surrender of the British resulted in 45,000 captured Indian Army soldiers, who were assembled on the field at Farrer Park on 17 February 1942 by the British commander on Japanese orders. It was here that the soldiers had to decide whether to remain as prisoners of war, or to join the Japanese-sponsored Indian National Army (INA) at the urging of officers who had earlier gone over to the Japanese side. One soldier recounted his mental struggle the night before he decided to join INA and took a personal vow to free India.2 In his searing memory, Farrer Park was the birthplace of INA.3
  Photography of INA Soldiers, Singapore/Malaya, c. 1940s, Collection of Indian Heritage Centre
This phase of INA's history was subsumed by the re-emergence of an INA led by Subhas Chandra Bose in Japanese-occupied Singapore in 1943, which became the dominant postmemory of INA. It is perhaps timely to have a divergent reading of the overlooked Farrer Park assembly as a turning point in subaltern self-awakening for the mass of prisoners who chose to join INA, in contrast to the sense of loss and betrayal as expressed in much of British and Australian war memory.
  Other perspectives that would also be worthwhile looking into are those of the descendants of local volunteer units including the Singapore Volunteer Corps, Dalforce and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve; and of civilians like the air-raid precaution wardens, nurses, firefighters and labourers who removed debris and retrieved corpses after Japanese aerial bombings. These war memories (or postmemories from their descendants) are necessboary to balance British and Australian war memory, and for the Asian subaltern to move from a peripheral position in war histories to a more nuanced one with some agency.
  A Continued Resonance
Today, the Singapore Civil Defence Force sounds the public-warning siren throughout Singapore every 15 February at 6.20 pm (local time), marking the nation's postmemory reminder of the surrender. Everyone in the city-state, young and old, is reminded of this dark period in Singapore's history.
  One cannot ignore the impact of the Fall of Singapore upon new generations. As we look back 80 years to the surrender, narratives big or small emerge, embedded within our family, the community and the nation. Commemoration, after all, is about retelling and remembering, and the act of doing so can be generative and meaningful. As long as succeeding generations are willing to engage with their postmemories, commemorative anniversaries can resonate even with the passage of time.

This grindstone and roller set is part of the Tang dynasty (618â€“907) cargo found in 1998 in a shipwreck off Belitung Island, Indonesia. The artefact was possibly from the Dvaravati culture (6â€“11th century) in central Thailand. This indicates that the ship likely made landfall at ports in this region during its voyage. It also suggests that some of the crew might be Southeast Asian in origin.
  After spending more than a millennium underwater, a lot of salt had accumulated on the items. The Tang Cargo Collection, as it is known now, was desalinated in 2003 before being donated to the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2013.

Despite the previous desalination treatment, however, soluble salts continued to crystallise, forming a distinctive white residue that was attached strongly to the stone surface. As the salts were visually distracting and the recurring salt crystallisation might lead to the disintegration of the stone, desalination was repeated in early 2021. Much like receiving a clay mask treatment, a wet paste was applied to the stone surface. As the paste dried, it absorbed the soluble salts close to the surfaceâ€”a technique known as poulticing.

Desalination is a major topic of study for me, so I was very excited to work on the Tang Cargo Collection. The practical experience has been enlightening, continually challenging me to improve the desalination treatment of these artefacts.

Formerly home to the British Naval Base, Sembawang used to be central to the military defence of the British Empire, with thriving communities that sprang up around the base.

Today a modern suburban town housing some 100,000 residents in mainly high-rise flats, Sembawang is not unlike most housing estates in Singapore. However, there is more than meets the eye when one digs deeper into its history: Sembawang used to play a central role in the military defence of the British Empireâ€”HM Naval Base, built to protect British territories in Asia-Pacific, was located here.
  For more than half a century since the 1920s, the naval base brought sailors and dockyard workers from around the world to this part of Singapore. The communities here were an international mix, and included people from Britain, Australia, India, Malaya and Hong Kong. The naval base also led to the establishment of satellite villages such as Chong Pang and Sembawang Village, which started out catering to dockyard workers and later matured into thriving socioeconomic centres.
  Establishing a Naval Base
  As early as 1919, Britain had identified Japan to be a serious threat to its empire in the Pacific. However, the First World War had exposed Britain's limitations in protecting its overseas territories if it were to be engaged in a concurrent war in Europe. A naval fleet based in Asia was therefore deemed necessary to counter this threat.
  At the time, the Royal Navy's base in Hong Kong was too close to Japanâ€” and thus vulnerable to attackâ€”and its anchorage was too small for modern warships. The British government hence decided to build a naval base that was large enough to house its main naval fleet. Singapore was chosen as it was relatively far from Japan and strategically located among key trading routes between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.

  Four potential sites north of Singapore were considered for their proximity to the narrow Johor Strait, which would have sheltered the base from an open sea attack. In 1922, Sembawang was selected as the site, and plans for the base were approved the following year, including accommodation and facilities for thousands of sailors.
  The decision to site the naval base in Sembawang permanently changed the physical and social landscape of the area. Like most of rural Singapore, the land in Sembawang had been used for the farming of cash crops since the early 1800s. By the 20th century, much of Sembawang was covered by rubber plantations, with most owned by Bukit Sembawang Rubber Company, which was set up by some of Singapore's early pioneers including merchant Tan Chay Yan and Straits Chinese community leader Lim Boon Keng.

  Rubber tappers working for Bukit Sembawang lived in houses built on land rented from the company, forming some of the earliest communities in the area. Lim Hoo Hong, who worked on the rubber plantations in the 1910s, shared in an oral history interview with the National Archives of Singapore:
  â€œI was nine years old then, my mother went with me to tap the rubber. The two of usâ€”mother and sonâ€”tapped two lots together, we made 80 cents a day. We built our home on the land that belonged to the Bukit Sembawang Rubber Company. They charged us a rent of only 50 cents a month.â€
  There was also the Orang Seletar, a boat-dwelling people who resided along the Johor Strait, as well as villagers who inhabited kampongs near the coast, which included Kampong Sembawang, Kampong Wak Tuang and Kampong Wak Hassan. These early communities were affected when the British took over swathes of land in Sembawang for the building of the naval base in the 1920s.

  Sections of rubber plantations were cleared, and some villages as well as most of the Orang Seletar were relocated, while other settlements dispersed after the land was acquired by the British.
  Besides local communities, some of the earlier establishments in Sembawang included seaside bungalows built by wealthy individuals who were drawn to the area for its scenic coastal location. These holiday getaways were located along the northern coast. One of them is Red House, which was built in 1919 by tycoon Joseph Aaron Elias, and another, Beaulieu House, was erected in the 1910s by businessman Joseph Brooke David. Both of these are still standing today. Such picturesque seaside houses were later also acquired by the British and adapted for new uses as part of the naval base.

  A Base Without a Fleet
  Delays plagued the construction of the naval base, which dragged on for more than a decade due to vacillating directions from the UK government. Finally, in 1938, HM Naval Base, Singapore, also known as Sembawang Naval Base, was officially declared open by Governor Shenton Thomas. The centrepiece of the base was the 305-metre-long King George VI Dry Dock, which was then the world's largest dry dock and could fit the Royal Navy's biggest battleships.

  Britain's defence plan was to dispatch its fleet of battleships from Europe to the naval base in Singapore in the event of a seaborne attack by the Japanese. In the approximately five to six weeks before the fleet arrived, it was expected that Singapore would be defended by its artillery guns.
  This defence plan fell apart quickly when the Second World War broke out in Europe in 1939. Despite its top-of-the-line facilities, the naval base never hosted the fleet it had been designed to accommodate. Britain was unable to send its fleet to Singapore as it was needed in naval confrontations with Germany. Instead, they dispatched a small squadron known as Force Z to deter the Japanese on 2 December 1941, but the Force's capital ships were swiftly attacked by Japanese planes and sunk.

  Without a fleet, the naval base was indefensible. As the Japanese army gathered across the Johor Strait, the British decided to damage the docks and destroy their equipment to prevent enemy use, before evacuating the base by the end of January 1942.

  Postwar Life at the Base 
  Despite the swift end to the role of the naval base in the theatre of war, the base continued to be used in the subsequent decades after the Second World War. It was returned to the British following the Japanese Occupation, and was involved in the Malayan Emergency (1948â€“60), the Korean War (1950â€“53) and Indonesia's Konfrontasi against the Federation of Malaysia (1963â€“66).

  During this postwar period, Royal Navy sailors who disembarked at the naval base resided at the Royal Navy Barracks, or HMS Terror. For sailors, docking at the base was a respite from the uncomfortable and stuffy quarters on board ships. Alan Tait, whose aircraft carrier HMS Centaur docked at the base in 1958, recalled:
  â€œThe accommodation at HMS Terror was on several levels with each having lovely cool balconies. We spent hours there writing letters home, chatting and playing cards. A short walk was a swimming pool. Tiger Beer flowed like water. After life on board, this was just about paradise.â€
  The thousands of workers at the naval base lived in quarters segregated by race and nationality. Europeans and Asian staff lived separately, with the former residing in the numerous black-and-white houses along Admiralty Road East. Asian workers lived in an area known as the Canberra Asian Quarters (or Canberra Lines), which comprised around 90 residential blocks along Canberra Road and three former side roads: Kowloon, Madras and Delhi Roads. These quarters were set aside not just for the workers, but also for their families.

  Former residents of Canberra Lines described the community to be closeknit. Subhas Anandan, who had lived there in the 1960s, remembered it as such:
  â€œPeople knew each other, the community was really united, we had no problems, racial problems, nothing. And we had Chinese, Malays, Malayalees, Tamils all living together.â€
  He also fondly recalled the community spirit among the workers:
  â€œWhen the big ships come in, they open up the dry dock. The ship will come in and they will close it back. The water will go off but the fish that come in cannot go out. So the whole dock is full of fish and people are just going down and collecting the fish. People were very good in the sense that not everybody worked in the dry dock, you see. So those who were there would take [fish] and share with all the workers. So when the big ships come, it's like a party, a carnival in the base, everybody having fresh fish.â€

  Most of the Chinese dockyard workers came from Hong Kong, which perhaps explains why Cantonese was the predominant Chinese dialect used by the workers. Leung Yew Kwong, who lived in Block 8 of Kowloon Road, described:
  â€œMy father, together with others from the Hong Kong dockyard, were transferred to the Singapore Naval Base in the 1930s. The naval ships in the dockyard, their cooks are usually Cantonese. So when they docked, he would invite them to our house and play mahjong.â€
  While the Asian dockyard workers were made up of people from Hong Kong, Malaya and Tamil Nadu, the majority were Malayalees who came from Keralain southwestern India. In 1960, there were around 5,000 Malayalee workers employed at the dockyard, leading some to nickname the naval base â€˜Little Kerala'. Poravankara Balji, who lived on Delhi Road with his family, shared:
  â€œThe naval base was unusual as it was a little island and a secure place. One thing I valued being in the naval base was that it was a Little Keralaâ€”the Keralan people were tightly knit. They even organised lessons in Malayalam. Even today I can still read and write Malayalam.â€

  Indeed, many of these naval base communities took charge to set up amenities and religious institutions to cater to their needs. For example, the Malayalees established a Naval Base Kerala Library in 1954 which housed thousands of Malayalam, Tamil and English books. The library also organised performances for the annual Onan festival celebrated by Malayalees of all faiths. Responding to the need for a proper place of worship for Muslim workers, Syed Amran Shah and his colleagues from the Naval Police Force raised funds to build Masjid Naval Base on Delhi Road.

  While the living quarters were segregated, one social activity that transcended ethnic lines was football. Work at the naval base ended at 4pm, leaving workers and sailors with plenty of daylight for a game of football at the empty field on Deptford Road. The matches were exciting events that attracted thousands of spectators who cheered for the different dockyard teams.
  The football culture in the naval base even honed homegrown talents including Quah Kim Song, who later became part of Singapore's national football team. Quah's father, Quah Heck Hock, worked in the dockyard and resided at Block 80, Delhi Road. Another national player with roots in the naval base is V. Sundramoorthy, popularly known as the â€˜Dazzler', whose family lived at Block 75, Madras Road.

  Chong Pang and Sembawang Village 
  While the naval base had enough basic amenities for daily needs, there was a demand for more food options and other types of services. Locals saw the demand and jumped on this economic opportunity by establishing businesses and communities at the fringes of the naval base.
  To the east of the naval base was the former Sembawang Village, which had been established in the late 1920s. Sembawang Village was also a transportation hub: Not only did it have buses that connected the village to Beach Road in the city, it was also a base for taxis, which brought residents to other parts of Singapore. By the 1960s, Sembawang Village had expanded to around 1,200 residents living in some 150 houses.

  Alan Tait recalled the diverse array of products sold at Sembawang Village:
  ""Sembawang Village was close by with its duty-free shops and bars. Cameras, watches, binoculars and all the usual were on offer at good prices. However, we were more fascinated with the toy shops. There were toys for sale that you couldn't find in the United Kingdomâ€¦ While we made our selections, we would be given a glass of Tiger Beer. The shopkeepers knew how to keep a customer happy.""
  The village was perhaps best known for its drinking holes and eateries that opened in the evening. The most famous stretch of bars was located in a row of shophouses at the junction of Admiralty Road East and Sembawang Road. Built in 1965 and known as the Sembawang Strip, it housed bars including Melbourne Bar Golden Hind, Ship Cabin and Nelson Bar. Former Royal Navy sailor David Ayres described the nightspot in its heyday in the 1960s:
  ""When I left Singapore in May 1964, there were about eight bars in Sembawang. Sembawang Bar was nearest to the naval base entrance. When I returned to Singapore in May 1966, there were more like 20 bars in Sembawang.""

  A much larger neighbourhood with a wider range of shops was Chong Pang Village, which was located to the south of the naval base. Chong Pang Village was established on land owned by Lim Chong Pang, the second son of landowner and early pioneer Lim Nee Soon. The younger Lim saw an economic opportunity in the naval base and proceeded to convert a former rubber plantation into a residential area. The proximity of the village to the base attracted dockyard workers such as clerks, mechanics, cooks, laundrymen and domestic help.
  By 1957, the population of Chong Pang Village had grown to around 11,000 residents. Chong Pang Village's town centre was known for being a community hub where people gathered, shopped and went about their daily lives, or sought entertainment at the Sultan Theatre, which screened Hindi, Tamil, Chinese and English films.

  End of a Chapter
  On 8 December 1968, a year after Britain had announced that it would withdraw its military forces from Singapore, HM Naval Base was transferred to the Singapore government. The dockyard was converted into a commercial shipyard under a new company, Sembawang Shipyard. Many of the base's workers continued to live at Canberra Lines until the 1980s and 1990s when the quarters were cleared for the construction of new public housing flats.
  Some of the former naval base workers still maintain close contact with each other via social media, and most of the stories in this article were uncovered through the active networks of former naval base residents.
  Remembering Sembawang's Pasts
  In July 2021, the National Heritage Board launched the Sembawang Heritage Trail to explore the colourful history of the area as well as the diverse communities that had sprung up around the naval base. In this self-guided trail, participants can visit some of the former landmarks associated with the naval base and imagine what life might have been like for some of these communities.
  Although some of the sites mentioned may no longer exist, the legacy of the naval base communities still persists in the community and religious institutions that have their roots in the base, and these serve as important tangible markers of social memory, reminding us of Sembawang's varied, past lives.

A silver flask from the Tang dynasty (618â€“907) was one of many luxurious metalware recovered from a shipwreck that had occurred over 1,100 years ago off Sumatra. Besides their opulent appeal, gold and silver vessels were also popular among the Tang elite because it was believed that drinking and eating from them would enhance one's longevity.
  This particular flask is notable for its large size and intricate workmanship. It is fully gilded, covered with the lush decoration of leaves and petals, and the handle is shaped like a snake. The pair of mandarin ducks on either side symbolise marital fidelity and harmony in traditional Chinese culture, as they are believed to mate with a single partner for life.

During conservation, the flask was observed to have foreign material deposits on its surface. Scientific analysis was thus carried out to identify the deposits in order to determine what conservation work was neededâ€”for example, whether the deposits should be removed or retained.

A glossy light-coloured deposit found on the underside of the flask was identified as aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate found in the marine environment. Another dull brown substance found atop the flask's base was identified to be an acrylic polymer. Since acrylic was only invented after the Tang dynasty, it was likely from later alterations. It is not uncommon to find non-original material on artefacts, as these could have accumulated from the environment or from previous repairs. They are reminders that artefacts require consistent conservation to withstand the test of time.

Being a conservation scientist, I am privy to the intricacies of artefacts up-close and can uncover their secretsâ€”a very fortunate position, indeed. Information gleaned from analysis helps to tell the  story behind an artefact, and as the writer Maya Angelou puts it: â€œThere is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.â€

Painting after conservation treatment in the custom-made frame. Murugan Surrounded by Planetary Deities, Sri Lanka, c. 19th Century, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum
The painting Murugan Surrounded by Planetary Deities from the Asian Civilisations Museum Collection is a rare 19th-century painted representation of a three-headed standing Muruganâ€”a Hindu and Tamil deityâ€”with a peacock vehicle. Often found in Buddhist monasteries all over Sri Lanka, this depiction demonstrates the absorption of Hindu deities into Buddhism. This painting also provides an insight into the provincial Kandyan style that diffused in the 19th century as the kingdom lost its power and the artists disbanded.

Created in a water-based technique, the painting was made on two wooden planks originally held together by a tongue-and-groove joint and natural glue. The main conservation issues were the separation of the panel at the joint as well as the development of splits and spiral distortion caused by the contraction of the wooden material. The paint layer was also covered with surface dirt, and it had several cracks resulting from the unstable wooden support. It was decided to reduce the planks' spiral distortion and rejoin them using the traditional glueing technique.

Meticulous cleaning of the paint layer gradually revealed the original vivid colours. However, the most challenging part of the conservation process was the linear stabilisation of the panel, which consisted of pulling and gluing distorted surfaces back into the panel. The success of these complex treatments required risk assessment and good planning, combined with knowledge and skills. Since the painting was going to be displayed permanently, it was important to frame it in such a way as to improve its integrity and display conditions. Thus, a wooden frame was designed and fabricated to compensate for some minor panel distortions and to enhance the look of the painting.

Rekindling Memories is a project aimed to capture the memories of seniors, aged 65 and above, about their past association with objects collected in the Singapore National Collection (NC). The NC images on Roots.sg are used as a conversation starter and a cognitive stimulation tool to encourage seniors to talk and share their stories which are part of Singapore's social history. These stories also give personal context to the objects.
The seniors are shown images of the NCs on a laptop, and they select a few to share their stories. They are given time to reminisce and prepare their sharing. Some begin shy but become natural and confident as they continue to share the wealth of their stories. Some looked through their albums to share their personal photographs. The story-sharing sessions were happy and cheerful moments. Majority prefer to share their stories in person, while a few, via email.
These sharing are audio-recorded and put into a five-minute video each, together with their personal photographs, videos, and the NC images they selected, as well as other related ones. Subtitles are included for those who spoke in their mother tongue. While clarifications are made for accuracies, their memories of how events or things were in the past are respected.

Cream crackers was said to be light and easily digestable, and the packaging was presentable. This tin (2018-00664) was reused as a container. Have fun interacting with the 3D model!

Dongnan Zheng (Dayneson), a former sound technician at the 1990s Haw Par Villa Dragon World theme park, ignited our interest and imagination and gave us a window into a long-gone world held together by an ensemble of dancers, actors, painters, and other crew members, through his soundscape of memories.
Text by Kitson Yap, Lee Si Ping, Nurfalah Sha'aban & Joshua Ong (Singapore Heritage Society)
Dongnan Zheng (Dayneson) was a sound technician at Haw Par Villa from 1991 to 1994. In this time, Haw Par Villa was a key tourist attraction, Dragon World theme park, one of the most popular tourists attractions in Singapore in the 90s. It was such a sensation that 20,000 advance tickets were sold before its opening day. Dragon World was impressive in scale: it could hold a capacity of 12,000 visitors on each day.
""Eager beavers snapped up 20,000 tickets for the new Haw Par Villa theme park even before the park made any announcement.
- The New Paper, 18 September 1990""
During his time there, Dongnan forged many good, long-standing friendships. He even created a photo montage to help his Dragon World buddies reminisce about the good ol' days. We chanced upon his montage on YouTube and got curious about what it was like to work at Dragon World. We asked him for an interview and he agreed, jovially taking us on a site walkthrough and a journey down memory lane one evening on 18 February 2022.

Our day with Dongnan started with music. The sound technician had brought along a small, portable speaker in his satchel, treating us to a whimsical playlist of music composed by the Cultural Medallion recipient, the late Iskandar Ismail. He explained to us that this was the music for the dramatic daily opening ceremony that would happen at Dragon World at the start of each working day, which Dongnan had helped to choreograph. Dongnan's workday used to start at 8am. His first duty was to turn on the music for the park's opening ceremony via a control room. Then, at 8.30am, an ensemble of performers dressed like celestial warriors would station themselves at the entrance, under the park's main signboard. At 9am, the celestial warriors actors would sound a gong. Staff on standby would then swing open the park's gates to welcome the day's eager visitors.

After the opening ceremony, Dongnan would go to the South China Sea Amphitheatre 30mins before the first scheduled show at 10am. Dongnan would be manning the control room, setting up the sound effects keyboard and checking on the music cassette tapes needed for the show. Through these experiences in this amphitheatre, he honed the craft of executing choreographed, dramatic sound work. A fire's crackling, the burst of a thunderstorm, the woosh of an arrow - these were the sounds that Dongnan played on cue, to generate an electrifying experience that would leave a mark on the audience. On stage, performers were busy wow-ing the audience with acrobatics, mascot performances, Chinese opera, and traditional Chinese music. These performances at the 2,000-seat amphitheatre were part of the tourist attraction offering at Dragon World.

After completing work at the amphitheatre, Dongnan would take a walk around Haw Par Villa where he lapped up the sometimes off-the-cuff performances at Dragon World's five other theatres. One of his favourites was the Four Seasons Theatre located at the site of the Aw brothers' former mansion (if you're visiting today it is the area with the red terrazzo steps). Performances at the Four Season Theatre typically involved a skit with four characters dressed as the Four Seasons, but visitors were sometimes also given costumes and invited to join the actors. Dongnan's day was filled with other enjoyable and memorable moments including break time where he'd retire to a rehearsal room at the back of Haw Par Villa, where Zehnder Road is. Here, he fondly recalled playing video games with cast member Gurmit Singh, and growing deep ties with the rest of the Dragon World community.

Sometimes, like in the movie 'Night at the Museum', after the park shuts its gates to the visitors at 6pm, the Dragon World cast members would stay behind to revel in after-hour parties, where they would unwind and enjoy themselves after a long day. According to Dongnan, ""We work[ed] hard. We play[ed] hard."" Apart from music concerts, there were also memorable themed parties.

Dongnan worked at Dragon World from 1991 to 1994. Haw Par Villa continues to have a special place in the memories of Dongnan and numerous other former cast members. They have often met to reminisce about those days. One way they continue to relive the past is via the music of the late Iskandar Ismail which was salvaged by Dongnan. It became a tradition for them to play this music during gatherings. 
Dongnan himself returns to Haw Par Villa from time to time. Each time he does so, he brings along a portable speaker to play the soundtrack of Dragon World, matching each tune to their former performance venue. Although the theme park no longer exists, he is relieved that Haw Par Villa still stand, for it represents a season in his life where he forged close relationships with those he worked, danced, joked, and sang with. ""[If they] tear down this place, I will be sad,"" Dongnan said.

About Partner
Kitson Yap, Lee Si Ping, Nurfalah Sha'aban and Joshua Ong are a group of students from various universities and disciplines that have an interest in helping others to appreciate Haw Par Villa after interning at Singapore Heritage Society (SHS). During the stint, they worked on a social media campaign for Haw Par Villa on SHS' Instagram and Facebook, #myhawparvilla, in the hopes of increasing public awareness of the site's heritage. After which, they had decided to continue our efforts in making Haw Par Villa more accessible so that others could appreciate Haw Par Villa.

Penjagaan Perubatan untuk Semua Manusia: Eu Yan Sang
Kisah Eu Yan Sang bermula pada tahun 1873 apabila Eu Kong, seorang pendatang dari Guangdong, China, tiba di Perak, Tanah Melayu.  Beliau membuat pemerhatian bahawa golongan pekerja lombong bijih timah sering menggunakan candu untuk mengurangkan kesakitan mereka.
Dengan keyakinan bahawa perubatan tradisional Cina boleh memberikan pengurusan kesakitan dan rawatan penyakit yang lebih baik, Eu membuka dewan perubatan di Gopeng pada tahun 1879, dengan menamakannya sebagai ""Yan Sang"", yang bermaksud ""menjaga semua manusia"" dalam bahasa Kantonis.
Apabila Eu Kong meninggal dunia, anak lelakinya, Eu Tong Sen, mengambil alih perniagaan pada usia 21 tahun. Berbekalkan kepintaran berniaga yang mendalam, Tong Sen mengembangkan perniagaan keluarganya daripada perubatan tradisional kepada perlombongan bijih timah, perladangan getah dan pembangunan hartanah. Berazam untuk membebaskan pelombong bijih timah daripada ketagihan candu mereka, beliau menubuhkan dewan perubatan berhampiran lombong bijih timahnya untuk menyediakan rawatan perubatan kepada golongan pelombong.
Menjelang tahun 1910-an, perniagaan perubatan tradisional Cina keluarga itu, yang dijenamakan semula sebagai ""Eu Yan Sang"", telah berkembang ke Singapura, Hong Kong dan selatan China. Dewan perubatan Eu Yan Sang pertama di Singapura dibuka di alamat 265-271 South Bridge Road pada tahun 1910. Selain menyediakan penjagaan kesihatan dan bekalan perubatan dengan harga yang berpatutan, dewan perubatan Eu Yan Sang juga menyediakan perkhidmatan pengiriman wang dan pembantu kedainya akan membantu para pendatang yang buta huruf membaca dan menulis surat.
Hari ini, Eu Yan Sang meneruskan misi pengasasnya untuk menjaga semua manusia melalui perubatan tradisional, dan mengendalikan lebih 200 cawangan dan klinik di rantau ini.
Pisau ini telah digunakan pada masa lalu oleh pakar herba Eu Yan Sang untuk menghiris dan memotong herba yang digunakan dalam preskripsi.
Rasa Tradisional Bak Kwa: Lim Chee Guan
Terkenal dengan orang ramai beratur panjang semasa musim perayaan, Lim Chee Guan ditubuhkan oleh Lim Kay Eng yang tiba dari Fujian, China pada tahun 1920-an. Dengan tidak menuruti hasrat ibu bapanya untuk menjadi seorang doktor, Lim bekerja keras di ladang dan kedai sebelum menyimpan wang yang cukup untuk memulakan perniagaan kereta sorong menjual bak kwa (hirisan daging barbeku) di sepanjang Chin Chew Road pada tahun 1938.
Lim menamakan perniagaan itu ""Chee Guan"" yang diterjemahkan sebagai ""cita-cita dan kewibawaan"" dalam bahasa Mandarin. Beliau membuat bak kwa menggunakan resipi neneknya dan mengubah suai perapan daging itu mengikut cita rasa tempatan. Lim turut berujikaji dalam proses penyediaan, seperti mengeringkan daging di bawah sinar matahari dan membakarnya di atas arang untuk memberikan rasa berasap yang tersendiri.
Pada tahun 1956, Lim berpindah ke rumah kedai yang disewa di sepanjang New Bridge Road di mana separuh daripada kedai itu digunakan untuk pengeluaran bak kwa dan yang separuh lagi untuk jualan runcit. Lim dan keluarganya kemudian menghabiskan sebahagian besar masa lapang mereka di kedai itu dan tradisi keluarga yang membantu dalam perniagaan ini masih diamalkan oleh generasi kedua dan ketiga keluarga Lim, yang menjalankan perniagaan itu sekarang.
Sehingga hari ini, jenama Lim Chee Guan berada dekat di hati para pelanggan lamanya, yang ramai daripada mereka tidak kisah beratur panjang malah menganggap beratur untuk membeli bak kwa di kedai itu sebagai tradisi Tahun Baru Cina.
Sepasang penyepit ini digunakan untuk membalik-balikkan hirisan daging semasa proses barbeku kerana ia lebih mudah digunakan berbanding penyepit kayu yang digunakan pada zaman dahulu.
Daripada Barang Kemas Perak kepada Barang Kemas Peranakan: Tukang Emas Kim Poh Hong
Selama lebih 80 tahun, Tukang Emas Kim Poh Hong telah membuat dan menjual barang kemas kepada generasi demi generasi pelanggan. Perniagaan ini diasaskan di 58 China Street pada tahun 1938 oleh Tan Eng Geok, seorang tukang perak yang datang ke Singapura dari Kinmen, China.
Semasa tahun awalnya, Kim Poh Hong menjual barang kemas perak daripada pemborong tempatan, serta barangan buatan tangan oleh Tan. Para pelanggannya, yang kebanyakannya masyarakat Hokkien, akan sering datang ke kedai itu untuk membeli barangan istimewa seperti pemegang azimat perak untuk bayi baru lahir dan barang kemas pengebumian untuk si mati. Kedai itu juga menjual barang kemas emas, terutamanya kepingan emas kemerah-merahan yang menjadi pilihan pelanggan Hokkien.
Pada tahun 1943, Tan menubuhkan kedai emas Poh Huat di North Bridge Road bersama rakan-rakan dan menjelang 1950-an, kedua-dua kedai itu telah terkenal dengan mutu kerja dan barang kemas yang dibuat khas. Poh Huat lebih kerap dikunjungi pelanggan Melayu, India dan Nyonya berdasarkan komposisi masyarakat di kawasan itu.
Pada tahun 1971, keluarga Tan membeli Poh Huat apabila para pengasasnya bersara, dan kemudian menggabungkannya dengan Kim Poh Hong. Apabila China Street menjalani pembangunan semula pada tahun 1990-an, Kim Poh Hong berpindah dan akhirnya menetap di Pickering Street pada tahun 2002.
Hari ini, Kim Poh Hong dikendalikan oleh generasi ketiga keluarga Tan dan terkenal dalam bentuk barang kemas enamel dan Peranakan.
Baucar hadiah perkahwinan yang dikeluarkan pada tahun 1950-an oleh Kim Poh Hong ini biasanya dibeli oleh ahli keluarga sebagai hadiah kepada pengantin baru.
Masakan Kantonis untuk Selera Tempatan: Restoran Spring Court
Salah satu restoran tertua di Singapura, Spring Court telah ditubuhkan di Great World Amusement Park pada tahun 1929 oleh Ho Loke Yee, bekas pemandu lori yang bertukar menjadi pengusaha restoran.
Pada asalnya dinamakan â€œWing Choon Yuenâ€ (â€œmenyanyi di taman musim bungaâ€ dalam bahasa Kantonis), restoran ini terkenal dengan hidangan Kantonis tempatan yang menggabungkan bahan-bahan daripada masakan Melayu, India, Hokkien dan Teochew, seperti cili dan serbuk kari, serta menampilkan perisa yang lebih kuat berbanding masakan tradisional Kantonis.
Sepanjang tahun 1930-an hingga 1960-an, Wing Choon Yuen adalah tempat di mana golongan elit, orang kenamaan, persatuan dan pengantin baru berduyun-duyun datang untuk menganjurkan majlis perayaan. Dengan kapasiti 100 meja, restoran itu sering menganjurkan tiga atau empat jamuan perkahwinan dalam satu malam. Malah, perniagaan begitu rancak sehingga Ho sering terpaksa tidur di restoran di atas katil yang diperbuat daripada meja makan.
Walau bagaimanapun, menjelang tahun 1970-an, perniagaan merosot apabila bilangan pengunjung ke Great World semakin berkurangan. Wing Choon Yuen kemudian berpindah ke New Bridge Road pada tahun 1978, memberi nama baru, â€œSpring Court"", sambil mengekalkan nama Cinanya, sebelum menduduki Upper Cross Street pada tahun 2004.
Bagi kebanyakan keluarga Cina Singapura, menyambut Tahun Baru Cina di Spring Court telah menjadi tradisi tahunan. Hari ini, restoran itu dikendalikan oleh generasi ketiga keluarga Ho yang kekal komited untuk memelihara warisan makanan Cina tempatan dan menawarkan tafsiran masakan Kantonis Singapura kepada generasi muda.
Gambar ini menunjukkan jamuan perkahwinan yang diadakan di Wing Choon Yuen semasa ia terletak di Great World Amusement Park, dan dianggap sebagai tempat yang unggul untuk mengadakan majlis perkahwinan.
Daripada Kedai Teh Tradisional kepada Pastri Lazat: Tong Heng
Diiktiraf hari ini kerana tart telurnya yang berbentuk berlian, Tong Heng bermula sebagai perniagaan pra-perang yang dikenali sebagai Huang Hou Teahouse.
Pengasasnya, Fong Chee Heng, yang tiba pada tahun 1910-an dari Guangdong, China, bermula sebagai penjaja jalanan yang menjaja minuman di pelbagai kedai teh. Dengan wang simpanan terkumpul selama bertahun-tahun, Fong membeli kedai teh di Smith Street pada tahun 1934, yang kemudian dinamakan semula sebagai ""Tong Heng"".
Kedai teh seperti Tong Heng merupakan asas budaya Kantonis di Chinatown di mana para pelanggannya akan bertemu  untuk minum teh, menikmati kuih-muih dan bersembang. Terletak di seberang teater opera Lai Chun Yuen, Tong Heng juga merupakan tempat peminat membeli makanan manis untuk bintang kegemaran mereka.
Selepas Perang Dunia Kedua apabila banyak kedai teh Chinatown berubah menjadi rumah makan, Tong Heng bertahan dengan membuat kuih-muih. Pada tahun 1960-an, keluarga itu memasang perabot yang memaparkan tart telur yang dibakar dalam pelbagai bentuk untuk menarik lebih ramai pelanggan. Strategi ini ternyata sangat berjaya, dan Tong Heng menjadi terkenal sebagai kedai konfeksi yang menawarkan tart telur dan pastri perkahwinan tradisional Kantonis.
Tong Heng terpaksa meninggalkan pekarangannya di Smith Street pada 1980-an kerana pembangunan semula kawasan itu dan berpindah ke lokasinya sekarang ini, di South Bridge Road. Hari ini, Tong Heng dikendalikan oleh keturunan generasi keempat dan terus kekal sebagai ikon Chinatown.
Kotak hadiah yang diperbuat khas ini digunakan untuk memuatkan barang kemas perkahwinan dan dihantar sebagai sebahagian daripada pakej apabila pelanggan menempah kuih-muih perkahwinan.
Daging Barbeku yang Cantik dan Beraroma: Bee Cheng Hiang
Bee Cheng Hiang bermula pada tahun 1930-an sebagai gerai tepi jalan yang menjual bak kwa (hirisan daging barbeku) berhampiran bekas Majestic Theatre di Chinatown. Perniagaan ini diasaskan oleh Teo Swee Ee, yang kemudian membuka kedai pertamanya di Rochor Road.
Keluarga itu menamakan perniagaan tersebut ""Bee Cheng Hiang"" dan setiap huruf Cina dalam namanya terdiri daripada sembilan strok untuk menandakan umur panjang dalam budaya Cina. Ia juga melambangkan pengalaman Bee Cheng Hiang, di mana bak kwa disebut-sebut sebagai ""makanan beraroma yang cantik"".
Teo adalah seorang ahli perniagaan yang bijak dengan naluri pemasaran yang kuat. Dari tahun 1950-an, Bee Cheng Hiang, ketika itu dieja sebagai ""Bee Chun Heng"", kerap mengeluarkan iklan, menaja program radio dan mengambil bahagian dalam pameran perdagangan.
Menjelang tahun 1970-an, Bee Cheng Hiang telah berkembang dan menubuhkan beberapa cawangan di kawasan bandar. Cawangan di New Bridge Road dengan cepat menjadi ikon di Chinatown di mana orang ramai akan beratur panjang di sekeliling blok semasa musim perayaan.
Walaupun Bee Cheng Hiang telah berkembang menjadi sebuah syarikat berbilang negara, ia terus menggunakan kaedah pengeluaran tradisional seberapa boleh, seperti menggunakan tangan untuk meletakkan hirisan daging pada dulang buluh. Penekanan pada tradisi inilah yang menjelaskan mengapa pelanggan lama kembali lagi â€“ untuk menikmati bak kwa yang terus mengekalkan rasa yang mereka nikmati sejak kecil lagi.
Resit ini dikeluarkan pada tahun 1972 oleh pemerintah Singapura bagi permohonan lesen makanan Bee Cheng Hiang untuk mengendalikan cawangan di New Bridge Road.
Ikon Teh Bermutu: Pek Sin Choon
Salah satu perniagaan teh tertua di Singapura, Pek Sin Choon, diasaskan pada tahun 1925 oleh Bai-Zhuang Dan Niang dan anaknya, Pek Kim Aw.
Bai-Zhuang berpindah ke Singapura pada tahun 1910 dari Anxi, China selepas kematian bapa Pek supaya Pek boleh menjadi perantis di kedai teh bapa saudaranya di sini dan belajar tentang perdagangan. Pek meninggalkan kedai bapa saudaranya selepas mendapat sedikit pengalaman untuk bekerja di Indonesia sebagai buruh, sebelum kembali ke Singapura untuk membuka perniagaan tehnya sendiri.
Untuk membina rangkaian pelanggannya sendiri, Pek akan membawa teh di atas palang bahu dari pintu ke pintu, menjualnya kepada peniaga dan penduduk di kawasan bandar. Menjelang 1925, Pek mempunyai wang simpanan yang cukup untuk menubuhkan kedainya sendiri di George Street. Beliau memilih kerbau sebagai maskot jenama tersebut kerana beliau digelar ""Kepala Kerbau"" oleh rakan-rakannya kerana sikapnya yang keras kepala. Lama-kelamaan Pek Sin Choon membina reputasi bagi campuran teh bermutunya.
Memandangkan teh bermutu menjadi ciri istimewa Pek Sin Choon, Pek menerapkan budaya di mana setiap ahli keluarga dan kakitangan mesti memperoleh ilmu mendalam mengenai penyediaan dan pembuatan teh.
Dikendalikan oleh generasi keempat sekarang ini, Pek Sin Choon terus dikenali sebagai pemborong dan peruncit terkemuka teh Cina premium, dan menjadi buruan pelanggan yang mencari adunan teh yang ditempah.
Ini ialah gambar pengasas Pek Kim Aw, diambil pada tahun 1960-an, dengan set teh yang digunakan untuk merasa minum teh.
Nama Yang Dikenali Umum untuk Emas Bermutu: Tukang Emas Tin Sing
Ditubuhkan pada tahun 1937 oleh keluarga Wong, Wan dan Chow, Tin Sing ialah kedai emas pra-perang terakhir yang terletak di sepanjang South Bridge Road.
Sehingga tahun 1970-an, emas dianggap sebagai wadah simpanan tradisional dan tukang emas seperti Tin Sing sering melihat pelanggan beratur untuk membeli emas pada hari gaji. Tin Sing amat popular kerana ia menjamin pembelian balik barang kemasnya sedang tidak ramai tukang emas menawarkan jaminan sedemikian.
Terkenal dengan mutu emas dan ketukangannya, Tin Sing menggajikan kira-kira 20 tukang mahir pada musim kemuncaknya dari tahun 1950-an hingga 1970-an. Tertarik dengan ketukangan Tin Sing, pelanggan seperti ahli politik, isteri hartawan, ratu cantik dan selebriti antarabangsa termasuk Fung Bo-bo, Jenny Tseng dan Li Li-hua kerap mengunjungi kedainya.
Tin Sing juga merupakan tukang emas yang dicari untuk kerja tempahan, yang sering menjadi liputan berita. Contohnya, pingat emas yang menggambarkan dua ekor burung layang-layang kembali ke sarang, dihadiahkan oleh peminat pada tahun 1952 kepada bintang opera Kantonis Hong Kong Sek Yin-Tsi; dan pingat emas yang ditempah oleh Dewan Perniagaan dan Perusahaan Cina Singapura, disampaikan sebagai tanda penghargaan kepada Perdana Menteri ketika itu, Encik Lee Kuan Yew, pada upacara pembukaan rasmi bangunan dewan itu pada tahun 1964.
Diuruskan oleh generasi kedua keluarga pengasas sekarang ini, Tin Sing kekal sebagai tukang emas tempatan yang dipercayai dan terus melayani pelanggan lama yang kembali membeli barang kemas untuk majlis khas atau reka bentuk tempahan tertentu.
Pembaris ini, yang digunakan oleh Tin Sin pada masa lalu, mengukur dalam inci tradisional Cina, yang berbeza daripada standard British.
Minyak dan Balsam Ubat yang Dipercayai: Chop Wah On
Diasaskan oleh Tong Chee Leong pada tahun 1916 di alamat 67 Pagoda Street, Chop Wah On ialah salah satu syarikat minyak dan balsam ubat tertua di Singapura.
Dikenali sebagai produk bermutu tetapi dijual pada harga yang berpatutan, Chop Wah On merupakan tempat persinggahan popular bagi kuli Cina dan wanita samsui yang kembali ke China untuk membeli hadiah, khususnya Red Flower Oil (â€˜Minyak Bunga Merah'). Anak lelaki sulung Tong, Tong Seng Mun, mengambil alih perniagaan pada tahun 1940-an dan terus mengekalkan harga murah untuk pelanggan kelas pekerjanya.
Kedai itu bukan sahaja melayani pelanggan tempatan, malah juga pelanggan dari China, di mana Chop Wah On telah membina reputasi yang kukuh hasil daripada generasi pendatang yang balik ke tanah air dengan membawa pulang produknya sebagai hadiah untuk keluarga dan rakan.
Selaku peminat haiwan, Tong mengendalikan perdagangan haiwan eksotik dari belakang rumah kedai Pagoda Street sehingga tahun 1960-an, membekalkan haiwan kepada institut penyelidikan dan zoo di luar negara. Keluarga itu turut mengimbau kedatangan Sultan Ismail dari Johor, seorang rakan Tong dan rakan peminat haiwan, yang mengunjungi rumah kedai itu untuk melihat haiwan di situ beberapa kali. Pada tahun 1957, Tong juga membuka zoo di Pasir Panjang, lengkap dengan seekor singa laut dari Belanda.
Chop Wah On berpindah ke Upper Cross Street pada tahun 2000 dan kini dikendalikan oleh generasi ketiga keluarga Tong yang terus berkembang berdasarkan kepercayaan dan kesetiaan daripada generasi pelanggan yang mempercayai kemujaraban ubat-ubatannya.
Ini adalah pembungkusan yang pernah digunakan untuk produk pengasas Chop Wah On, dan ia mengandungi alamat lama kedai itu di 67 Pagoda Street dan 7 Smith Street.
Daripada Barang Kemas Tradisional kepada Barang Kemas Halus: Mengenai Cheong Jewellery Barang Kemas On Cheong
Terkenal dengan ketukangan dan reka bentuk barang kemas yang unik, On Cheong diasaskan pada 1936 oleh Ho Yew Ping yang berhijrah dari Guangdong, China pada 1925 dan menjadi perantis di pelbagai tukang emas di Malaya sebelum berpindah ke Singapura.
Ho menubuhkan kedai pertamanya bersama rakan di North Bridge Road menjual aksesori perak dan emas, dan menamakan perniagaan itu â€œOn Cheongâ€ yang diterjemahkan kepada â€œkeamanan dan kemakmuranâ€ dalam bahasa Kantonis, yang mencerminkan keinginan pendatang pada masa yang tidak menentu itu.
Pada tahun 1941, Ho memindahkan On Cheong ke alamat 251 South Bridge Road kerana beliau berharap kepadatan penduduk Chinatown yang lebih tinggi akan menghasilkan lebih ramai pelanggan dan, sebagai orang Kantonis sendiri, berpendapat adalah lebih mudah menjalankan perniagaan dengan pelanggan yang kebanyakannya Kantonis.
Sehingga tahun 1990-an, On Cheong adalah tukang emas yang dipercayai oleh para pelanggan yang membeli emas untuk dijadikan  simpanan. Walau bagaimanapun, apabila lebih ramai rakyat Singapura mula membeli barang kemas untuk kegunaan peribadi, Ho Nai Chuen, anak bongsu pengasas, memutuskan untuk memodenkan jenama itu, dan mula mengkhususkan syarikat dalam penghasilan kepingan jed yang jarang didapati dan reka bentuk barang kemas yang ditempah.
Kini sebagai pembekal barang kemas halus, On Cheong telah berjaya beralih kepada menawarkan reka bentuk barang kemas yang unik dan karya agung yang direka oleh pakar kepada para pelanggannya yang amat berpuas hati.
Papan tanda perniagaan ini mengandungi nama Tukang Emas On Cheong dan anak syarikatnya Sin Thong Sin Keok yang menyediakan perkhidmatan pengiriman wang untuk pendatang Cina.
Daripada Kacang Tanah kepada Pencuci Mulut Tradisional: Mei Heong Yuen
Terkenal dengan pencuci mulut tradisionalnya hari ini, tidak ramai yang mungkin menyedari bahawa Mei Heong Yuen (â€œtaman wangiâ€ dalam bahasa Kantonis) mula beroperasi sebagai pengeluar kacang tanah panggang.
Perniagaan itu diasaskan oleh Lee Chit Heng, yang bekerja dalam industri kacang panggang di Menglembu, Ipoh, sebelum berpindah ke Singapura pada 1940-an. Lee menubuhkan Mei Heong Yuen, yang menjual kacang Menglembu di Pagoda Street sebelum berpindah ke alamat 39 Temple Street.
Dipasarkan di bawah nama â€œFarmer Brandâ€, Mei Heong Yuen membekalkan kacang tanah kepada peruncit dan restoran tempatan, manakala kacang tanah yang baru dipanggang dijual mengikut berat di Temple Street. Menjelang 1970-an, kacang tanahnya telah dieksport ke rantau ini, Hong Kong, Eropah dan Amerika Syarikat. Walaupun eksport terus berkembang pada tahun 1990-an, perniagaan di Temple Street menghadapi persaingan sengit dengan pengenalan lebih banyak makanan ringan baru di pasaran.
Dalam usaha mempelbagaikan perniagaan dan mengekalkan keterampilan Mei Heong Yuen di Chinatown, anak perempuan Lee, Clara dan Connie, menghasilkan idea untuk menjual pencuci mulut tradisional Kantonis di kedai keluarga mereka di 67 Temple Street.
Usaha itu terbukti berjaya dan Mei Heong Yuen telah berkembang ke beberapa cawangan di seluruh pulau, dan sebagai tanda hormat kepada warisan mereka, kacang tanah di bawah jenama Farmer Brand terus dijual di beberapa kedai pencuci mulut mereka hari ini.
Gambar James Lee, anak  pengasas Lee Chit Heng, ini diambil di kilang kacang tanah panggang keluarga di Malaysia, di mana produk Farmer Brand masih dihasilkan hari ini.

Medical Care for Mankind: Eu Yan Sang
The story of Eu Yan Sang started in 1873 when Eu Kong, an immigrant from Guangdong, China, arrived in Perak, Malaya where he observed that tin miners often turned to opium to ease their pains.
Convinced that traditional Chinese medicine could provide better pain management and treat ailments, Eu opened a medical hall in Gopeng, Perak in 1879, naming it â€œYan Sangâ€, which translates to â€œcaring for mankindâ€ in Cantonese.
When Eu Kong passed away, his son, Eu Tong Sen, took over the business at the age of 21. Armed with an astute business acumen, Tong Sen expanded the family's business from traditional medicine to tin mines, rubber plantations and properties. Determined to free tin miners from their opium addiction, he set up medical halls near his tin mines to provide medical care for miners.
By the 1910s, the family's traditional Chinese medicine business, rebranded as â€œEu Yan Sangâ€, had extended to Singapore, Hong Kong, and southern China. In 1910, the first Eu Yan Sang medical hall in Singapore opened at 265-271 South Bridge Road. Besides providing affordable healthcare and medical supplies, Eu Yan Sang medical halls also provided remittance services and its shop assistants would help illiterate migrants read and pen letters.
Today, Eu Yan Sang continues the founder's mission of caring for mankind through traditional medicine, operating over 200 retail outlets and clinics in the region.
This knife was used in the past by Eu Yan Sang's herbalists to slice and trim herbs used in prescriptions.
Traditional Taste of Bak Kwa: Lim Chee Guan
Famed for its snaking queues during festive periods, Lim Chee Guan was established by Lim Kay Eng who arrived from Fujian, China in the 1920s. Defying his parents' wishes for him to be a doctor, Lim toiled in plantations and shops before saving enough to start a pushcart business selling bak kwa (barbecued meat slices) along Chin Chew Road in 1938.
Lim named the business â€œLim Chee Guanâ€,  which translates to â€œambition and integrityâ€ in Mandarin. He made bak kwa using his mother's recipe and adapted the marinade of the meat to suit local tastes. Lim also experimented on the preparation process, such as sun-drying the meat and barbecuing it over charcoal to give it a distinctive smoky taste.
In 1956, Lim relocated to a rented shophouse along New Bridge Road where half the shop was used for bak kwa production and the other half for retail. Lim and his family would spend most of their free time at the shop and this family tradition of helping out in the business is still practised by the second and third generations of the Lim family, who currently run the business.
To this day, Lim Chee Guan holds a special place in the hearts of its long-time customers, many of whom do not mind the long queues and in fact, regard queuing for the shop's bak kwa as a Lunar New Year tradition.
This pair of tongs was used to flip slices of meat during the barbecuing process as it was easier to wield compared to wooden chopsticks, which were used in the past.
From Silver to Peranakan Jewellery: Kim Poh Hong Goldsmith
For more than 80 years, Kim Poh Hong Goldsmith has been crafting and selling jewellery to generations of customers. The business was founded at 58 China Street in 1938 by Tan Eng Geok, a silversmith who came to Singapore from Kinmen, China.
During its early years, Kim Poh Hong sold silver jewellery from local wholesalers, as well as handcrafted pieces by Tan. Its customers, who were mainly Hokkiens, would frequent the shop to purchase special items such as silver amulet holders for newborns and burial jewellery for the deceased. The shop also traded gold jewellery, notably reddish gold pieces preferred by Hokkien customers.
In 1943, Tan established Poh Huat Goldsmiths at North Bridge Road with friends and by the 1950s, both shops had become known for their workmanship and custom-made jewellery. Poh Huat was frequented more by Malay, Indian and Nonya customers due to the make-up of the community in the area.
The Tan family bought over Poh Huat Goldsmiths in 1971 when the founders retired and subsequently merged it with Kim Poh Hong. When China Street underwent redevelopment in the 1990s, Kim Poh Hong relocated and eventually settled at Pickering Street in 2002. 
Today, Kim Poh Hong is run by the third generation of the Tan family and has carved a niche in designing enamel and Peranakan jewellery.
This wedding gift voucher issued in the 1950s by Kim Poh Hong was commonly purchased by family members as gifts to newlyweds.
Cantonese Cuisine for Local Palates: Spring Court Restaurant
One of the oldest restaurants in Singapore, Spring Court was established at Great World Amusement Park in 1929 by lorry driver turned restaurateur, Ho Loke Yee.
Originally named â€œWing Choon Yuenâ€ (â€œsinging in a spring gardenâ€ in Cantonese), the restaurant was reputed for its localised Cantonese fare, which incorporated ingredients from Malay, Indian, Hokkien and Teochew cuisines, such as chilli and curry powder, and featured stronger flavours than traditional Cantonese cuisine. 
During the 1930s to 1960s, Wing Choon Yuen was where elite, dignitaries, associations and newlyweds would flock to for celebratory feasts. With its capacity of 100 tables, the restaurant often hosted three or four wedding banquets per night. In fact, business was so brisk that Ho often had to sleep over at the restaurant on a makeshift bed of dining tables.
However, by the 1970s, business declined as the number of visitors to Great World dwindled. Wing Choon Yuen then relocated to New Bridge Road in 1978, renaming itself â€œSpring Courtâ€ while retaining its Chinese name, before settling at Upper Cross Street in 2004.
For many Singaporean Chinese families, celebrating Lunar New Year at Spring Court has become an annual tradition. Today, the restaurant is run by the third generation of the Ho family who remains committed to preserving local Chinese food heritage and offering a Singaporean interpretation of Cantonese cuisine to the younger generation.
This photograph shows a wedding banquet held at Wing Choon Yuen when it was located at Great World Amusement Park and regarded as a grand venue to hold weddings.
From Traditional Teahouse to Delicious Pastries: Tong Heng
Recognised for its diamond-shaped egg tarts today, Tong Heng has its roots as a pre-war establishment known as Huang Hou Teahouse.
Its founder, Fong Chee Heng, who arrived in the 1910s from Guangdong, China, started out as an itinerant hawker peddling drinks in various teahouses. With savings accumulated over the years, Fong bought over the teahouse on Smith Street in 1934, which was later renamed â€œTong Hengâ€.
Teahouses like Tong Heng were a cornerstone of Cantonese culture in pre-war Chinatown where patrons would gather to drink tea, enjoy confectioneries and chat. Located across opera theatre Lai Chun Yuen, Tong Heng was also where fans would purchase sweet treats for their favourite stars.
After World War II, many of Chinatown's teahouses transformed themselves into eating houses, but Tong Heng persevered with the making of confectioneries. In the 1960s, the family installed a showcase displaying egg tarts baked in different shapes to attract more customers. This strategy proved to be highly successful, and Tong Heng became well-known as a confectionery store offering egg tarts and traditional Cantonese wedding pastries.
Tong Heng had to vacate its premises on Smith Street in the 1980s due to the redevelopment of the area and relocated to its current location on South Bridge Road. Today, Tong Heng is run by fourth generation descendants and continues to be an icon of Chinatown.
This custom-made gift box was used to contain wedding jewellery and delivered as part of the package when customers ordered wedding confectioneries.
Beautiful and Aromatic Barbecued Meat: Bee Cheng Hiang
Bee Cheng Hiang started in the 1930s as a roadside stall selling bak kwa (barbecued meat slices) near the former Majestic Theatre in Chinatown. The business was founded by Teo Swee Ee, who subsequently opened his first shop at Rochor Road.
The family named the business â€œBee Cheng Hiangâ€ and each Chinese character of its name is composed of nine strokes to signify longevity in Chinese culture. It was also a representation of the Bee Cheng Hiang experience, where the bak kwa is touted as â€œbeautiful, aromatic delicaciesâ€.
Teo was an astute businessman with strong marketing instincts. From the 1950s, Bee Cheng Hiang, then spelled as â€œBee Chun Hengâ€, advertised regularly, sponsored radio programmes and participated in trade expositions.
By the 1970s, Bee Cheng Hiang had expanded and set up several branches in the city area. This New Bridge Road branch quickly became an icon in Chinatown where queues would form round the block during festive seasons.
Though Bee Cheng Hiang has grown into a multinational company, it continues to employ traditional production methods where possible, such as spreading meat slices on bamboo trays by hand. It is this emphasis on tradition that explains why long-time customers return again and again â€“ for bak kwa which remains true to the taste they grew up with.
This receipt was issued in 1972 by the Singapore government for Bee Cheng Hiang's food licence application to operate the branch at New Bridge Road.
Hallmark of Quality Tea: Pek Sin Choon
One of the oldest tea merchants in Singapore, Pek Sin Choon was founded in 1925 by Bai-Zhuang Dan Niang and her son Pek Kim Aw.
Bai-Zhuang moved to Singapore in 1910 from Anxi, China after the death of Pek's father so that Pek could apprentice at his uncle's tea shop here and learn the trade. Pek left his uncle's shop after gaining some experience to work in Indonesia as a labourer, before returning to Singapore to set up his own tea business.
To build his own clientele, Pek would carry tea on a shoulder pole, selling it door-to-door to businesses and residents in the city area. By 1925, Pek saved enough to set up his own shop on George Street. He chose the buffalo as the brand's mascot because he was nicknamed â€œBuffalo Headâ€ by his associates due to his strongheaded character. Pek Sin Choon gradually gained a reputation for its quality tea blends over the years.
As quality teas became the hallmark of Pek Sin Choon, Pek instilled a culture where every family and staff member must acquire deep knowledge in the preparation and brewing of tea.
Run by the fourth generation today, Pek Sin Choon continues to be known as a leading wholesaler and retailer of premium Chinese tea, and is sought after by clients looking for its bespoke tea blends.
This is a photograph of founder Pek Kim Aw, taken in the 1960s, with the tea set used for sampling tea.
Household Name for Quality Gold: Tin Sing Goldsmiths
Founded in 1937 by the Wong, Wan and Chow families, Tin Sing is one of the last pre-war goldsmiths located along South Bridge Road.
Until the 1970s, gold was regarded as a traditional means of savings and goldsmiths such as Tin Sing often saw customers queueing to purchase gold on pay days. Tin Sing was particularly popular as it guaranteed buyback of its jewellery during a time when few goldsmiths offered such an assurance.
Renowned for the quality of its gold and craftsmanship, Tin Sing employed some 20 master craftsmen at its peak from the 1950s to 1970s. Drawn by Tin Sing's craftsmanship, patrons like politicians, tycoons' wives, pageant queens and international celebrities such as Fung Bo-bo, Jenny Tseng and Li Li-hua regularly graced its shop floor.
Tin Sing was also the go-to jeweller for commissioned works, which often made headlines. Examples include a gold medallion depicting two swallows returning to a nest, gifted by a fan in 1952 to Hong Kong Cantonese opera star Sek Yin-Tsi; and a gold medallion commissioned by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, presented as a token of appreciation to then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew at the official opening of the chamber's building in 1964.
Managed by the second generation of the founding families today, Tin Sing remains a trusted local jeweller and continues to serve long-time customers who return to purchase pieces for special occasions or commission custom designs.
This ruler, used by Tin Sing in the past, measures in traditional Chinese inches, which differ from the imperial standard.
Trusted Medicated Oils and Balms: Chop Wah On
Founded by Tong Chee Leong in 1916 at 67 Pagoda Street, Chop Wah On is one of the oldest medicated oil and balm companies in Singapore.
Reputed for its quality yet affordable products, Chop Wah On was a popular stop for Chinese coolies and Samsui women returning to China to stock up on gifts, in particular its Red Flower Oil. Tong's eldest son, Tong Seng Mun, took over the business in the 1940s and continued to keep prices low for its working-class customers.
The shop not only serves local customers, but also customers from China, where Chop Wah On has built a strong reputation thanks to generations of returning immigrants bringing its products home as gifts for family and friends.
An animal enthusiast, Tong operated an exotic animal trade from the back of the Pagoda Street shophouse up to the 1960s, supplying animals to research institutes and zoos overseas. The family recalled the Sultan Ismail of Johor, a friend of Tong and fellow animal enthusiast, visiting the shophouse incognito to view the animals a number of times. In 1957, Tong also opened a zoo in Pasir Panjang, complete with a sea lion from the Netherlands.
Chop Wah On relocated to Upper Cross Street in 2000 and is now run by the third generation of the Tong family who continues to build upon the trust and loyalty from generations of customers who swear by its remedies.
These are former packaging used for Chop Wah On's founding products, and they bear the shop's former addresses at 67 Pagoda Street and 7 Smith Street.
From Traditional to Fine Jewellery: On Cheong Jewellery
Known for its craftsmanship and unique jewellery designs, On Cheong was founded in 1936 by Ho Yew Ping who immigrated from Guangdong, China in 1925 and apprenticed at various goldsmiths in Malaya before moving to Singapore.
Ho set up his first shop with friends at North Bridge Road selling silver and gold accessories, and named the business â€œOn Cheongâ€, which translates to â€œpeace and prosperityâ€ in Cantonese, reflecting the desires of immigrants in those uncertain times.
In 1941, Ho relocated On Cheong to 251 South Bridge Road as he hoped that Chinatown's higher population density would result in more customers and, as a Cantonese person himself, felt that it would be easier doing business with a predominantly Cantonese clientele. 
Up till the 1990s, On Cheong was primarily a trusted goldsmith for customers who bought gold as a means of savings. However, as more Singaporeans began buying jewellery for personal use, Ho Nai Chuen, the founder's youngest son, decided to modernise the brand, and started specialising in rare jade pieces and customised jewellery designs.
Now an established purveyor of fine jewellery, On Cheong has successfully pivoted to offering unique jewellery designs and expertly crafted masterpieces to appreciative customers.
This business sign bears the names of On Cheong Goldsmiths and its subsidiary Sin Thong Sin Keok, which provided remittance services for Chinese immigrants.
From Peanuts to Traditional Desserts: Mei Heong Yuen
Known for its traditional desserts today, few might be aware that Mei Heong Yuen (â€œfragrant gardenâ€ in Cantonese) first began operations as a producer of roasted peanuts.
The business was founded by Lee Chit Heng, who worked in the roasted peanut industry in Menglembu, Ipoh, before relocating to Singapore in the 1940s. Lee established Mei Heong Yuen, which sold Menglembu peanuts on Pagoda Street before relocating to 39 Temple Street.
Marketed under the name â€œFarmer Brandâ€, Mei Heong Yuen supplied peanuts to local retailers and restaurants, while freshly roasted peanuts were sold by weight at Temple Street. By the 1970s, its peanuts were exported to Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Europe, and the United States. While exports continued to flourish in the 1990s, business on Temple Street faced stiff competition with the introduction of more novel snacks in the market. 
In an attempt to diversify the business and retain Mei Heong Yuen's presence in Chinatown, Lee's daughters, Clara and Connie, came up with the idea of selling traditional Cantonese desserts at the family's shop at 67 Temple Street.
The venture proved successful and Mei Heong Yuen has expanded to several outlets across the island, and as a nod to their heritage, Farmer Brand peanuts continue to be sold at some of their dessert shops today.
This photograph of James Lee, son of founder Lee Chit Heng, was taken at the family's roasted peanuts factory in Malaysia, where Farmer Brand products are still manufactured today.

A 2021 discovery of a pair of boundary markers uncovered the true extent of prominent philanthropist Tan Kim Seng's sweeping estate, as well as the little-known story of merchant Sim Liang Whang and his business, Teck Kee, after which a road on the fringe of Serangoon Gardens is named after.
History In Plain Sight
For more than a century, Dover Forest hid a secret. Partially buried under a soft pile of leaves was a boundary marker linked to one of the largest swathes of land likely ever owned by a single person in modern Singapore's history.
In January 2021, while out on a site visit with some members of the nature community, National Development Minister Desmond Lee stumbled upon the artefact. On closer inspection, it was clear that the moss-covered granite marker belonged to prominent merchant Tan Kim Seng for it bore his English initials, as well as the name of his family's business in Chinese â€œè±Šèˆˆâ€ (Hong Hin).

One of the oldest surviving personalised boundary markers likely to exist in Singapore was discovered in Dover Forest in January 2021. The 90cm long slab was covered in moss with about two-thirds of it buried. It weighs 62kg, the average weight of an adult. Its discovery serves as a tangible reminder of Tan Kim Seng's larger-than-life presence and spirit of enterprise. It now lies in the National Heritage Board's care.
Boundary markers demarcate the perimeters of land owned. Its discovery thus provides concrete evidence of the scale of Tan's estate, depicted on a 1885 map.
Likely purchased by Tan as an investment in 18621, researchers ascertained that the estate stretched from present-day Clementi Avenue 2 in the west to Dawson Road in the east, and also encompassed the area beginning at the School of Science and Technology â€” a specialised independent secondary school in the north, all the way down to Southern Kent Ridge Park in the south.
To put it simply, Tan's estate ran the length of more than four MRT stations beginning at Queenstown, passing through Commonwealth and Buona Vista, and ending after Dover, en-route to Clementi.

Vivienne Tan, who published a book about Tan Kim Seng, her husband's ancestor, shares about the family's delight upon learning about the existence of the boundary marker. Meanwhile, map research consultant Mok Ly Yng weighs in on its significance.

The substantial area Tan Kim Seng owned in southwestern Singapore during the 19th century which is now home to educational campuses such as the National University of Singapore and Singapore Polytechnic, as well as a part of the Southern Ridges, one-north, and Queensway. The marker, depicted by the cross above, delineates the northernmost frontier of Tan's estate which was once planted with rubber and coconut trees. Source: OneMap
The marker lends credence to the oft-repeated refrain â€” at least among his descendants â€” that the family had once owned â€œthe whole of Queenstownâ€2.

The estate, much of which was uncultivated, was handed over to the colonial government in 1947 by Tan's great-great grandson Eng Chiang.
A Surprise Find
During the excavation of Tan's marker in October 2021, a second marker, engraved with just the words â€œå¾·è¨˜ç•Œâ€ (Teck Kee's Boundary in Chinese), was found. This time, some sleuthing was required to unearth its owner and his backstory.

The Chinese characters å¾·è¨˜ç•Œ, which mean Teck Kee's Boundary, were painted in red â€” an auspicious and eye-catching colour.
Researchers eventually learnt that the land lot where Tan's marker had been found, shared a boundary with land owned by Sim Liang Whang (1856-8 March 1921) â€” a merchant who ran a business called Chop Teck Kee3 at 15 and 16 Kling Street (present-day Chulia Street in downtown Singapore).

Senior Conservator (Objects) Berta MaÃ±as Alcaide shares the steps involved in the conservation of the granite markers while map research consultant Mok Ly Yng discusses the significance of Sim Liang Whang's marker with Winston Lim, General Manager of Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.
Land records show that Sim purchased two lots in the area for a combined total of four acres â€” the size of about two football fields â€” where he ran a modest rubber plantation. He owned it for 11 years after buying it from another merchant.
Sim, who also traded pepper and gambier4, became synonymous with the name Teck Kee, likely because of the success it saw.
In October 2021, both markers were carefully extracted and sent to the Heritage Conservation Centre for cleaning, conservation treatment, and further research.

Delving deeper into Sim's story, researchers learnt that Jalan Teck Kee â€” an existing road on the fringe of Serangoon Gardens which he owned â€” was named after his business. A village named after the road also sprouted up in the area before it was redeveloped in the 1980s. It was likely that Chop Teck Kee was one of Sim's most important or significant enterprises.

Together with the road, the marker represents the life and legacy of Sim, and offers Singaporeans of today a unique opportunity to learn more about the merchant class of yesteryear.
Both unearthed artefacts will be in good company for they join a pair of boundary markers used by businessman and philanthropist Cheang Hong Lim (1825â€“1893) and his son to demarcate the limits of the land they owned near present-day Pasir Panjang. These were added to the National Collection in 2015.

Boundary Markers
In 1881, Sir Henry Edward McCallum, the Acting Colonial Engineer and Surveyor-General of the Straits Settlements, introduced the practice of marking boundaries permanently with granite stones. On 12 May 1882, the Landmarks Ordinance which required landowners to install appropriate markers, came into effect.
Today, boundary markers come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are cylindrical and made out of concrete, others might be made out of iron spikes. The least obtrusive ones are cut marks on tiles. These days, only land surveyors are permitted to install boundary markers in Singapore.
Tan Kim Seng
A road, bridge and fountain are named after Tan (8 November 1806-14 March 1864), a prominent Peranakan businessman and philanthropist who is known for his contributions to waterworks in the colony, as well as his charisma and large parties7.
His ability to converse in Chinese, Malay and English gave him a leg-up over his business rivals,8 paving the way for him to ink deals with both British and Chinese merchants.9
Originally based in Malacca, but prompted to move because the Dutch were taxing businessmen like him heavily, Tan left for British-run Singapore.10
He started out trading spices before moving into estate management, making the conscious effort to avoid getting involved in the highly profitable opium trade.
His company Hong Hin has roots in Malacca. It was started by his grandfather who moved from China to Malaya in the hopes of carving out a new life. Tan grew Hong Hin and continued to make a success of it.
With the goal of raising educational standards, Tan started Chong Wen Ge, Singapore's first Chinese school in 1849 along Telok Ayer Street. Although the school is now defunct, the pavilion in which it was housed still stands today, having been gazetted as a national monument in 1973 alongside the neighbouring Thian Hock Keng temple. Tan also founded the Chui Eng Free School in 1854.
Sim Liang Whang
While Sim is less famous than Tan, his story is similarly riveting, especially since it offers a snapshot into another strata of society â€” the upper middle class of yesteryear who poured their hearts into succeeding in the colony.
Sim was a first-generation immigrant to Singapore, having moved to the island as a teenager from the Chao'an District of Guangdong, China.
To get an edge over his competitors, he adopted the name Sim Choon Kee which was presumably simpler for English-speaking clients and businessmen to remember. He also went by the name Sim Teck Kee, after his most successful business. This was possibly great for brand recall.
Over time, Sim became a relatively successful businessman. For instance, his involvement in the rubber trade extended to Johore. According to an advertisement in August 1923, he owned almost 300 acres of rubber estate in Muar and another 85 or so acres in Kota Tinggi.11
Sim also grew to become a prominent Teochew community leader, doing well enough to co-found Tuan Mong School in 1906;12 and contribute to the establishment of one of Singapore's earliest banks â€” the Sze Hai Tong Banking & Insurance Company Limited which later merged with the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited or OCBC.13

Sim Liang Whang was a Teochew community leader who, among other things, co-founded Tuan Mong School (above) in 1906. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
To further integrate into the colony, Sim enrolled his sons in English language schools. The oldest, Boon Kwang, became a member of the Singapore Volunteer Infantry and rose to the rank of corporal before leaving the local militia unit in 1907. His second son Boon Eng was a shipping clerk. His youngest, Boon Teck, was a lawyer.
Records show that Sim threw his weight behind important political causes. For instance, both he and his son Boon Kwang (æ²ˆæ–‡å…‰) were members of the Tong Meng Hui (åŒç›Ÿä¼š) Singapore Branch â€” an underground resistance movement founded by Dr Sun Yat Sen who was involved in overthrowing the Qing dynasty and securing China's future as a modern republic.

Record on the Tongmenghui Singapore Branch by Lim Nee Soon (1928) Reproduced with Permission from Xiamen University
While both Tan and Sim's trajectories differed somewhat, the paths of their descendants would one day converge serendipitously.
An entry in the book One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore notes that Boon Kwang and Tan's great-grandson Tan Soo Bin, both members of the Chinese Company of the Singapore Volunteer Infantry, participated in the same meeting in 1905.

Tan Kim Seng's great-grandson Soo Bin and Sim Liang Whang's son Boon Kwang likely crossed paths while serving as members of the Singapore Volunteer Infantry according to this excerpt from the book One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore (above) which notes that they attended the same meeting in 1905.14
Sim also owned a shop at 71 North Boat Quay called Chop Huat Seng which was likely his final business venture. It was also the site of his wake in 1921. Upon his passing, revolutionary leader Dr Sun conveyed his condolences to Sim's family through prominent local revolutionary leaders.

Watch: Meet the Expert: Phyllis Koh
  What was a typical day in the life of a paper conservator like before the pandemic?
There is usually a myriad of different activities in the day, like when we are in the paper lab, we could be carrying out photo-documentation and treatment on the collection such as documents, drawings, maps, prints, etc. We could also be supervising framers on the mounting and framing of paper works that will be displayed at the exhibitions. At times, we may have impromptu gatherings around the lab table to quickly discuss on a difficult treatment or to distribute exhibition work. Besides exhibition projects, a few of us might be involved in research projects or at the museums to carry out installation work onsite.
How has the pandemic changed the way you work, given how hands-on your work is?
I think now we all must be even more conscious of how we plan and spend our time, to balance the administrative needs and bench work. For example, I tend to focus more on the critical hands-on work on the designated days that I'm at the Heritage Conservation Centre and try to clear as much administrative work when I work from home. I think the pandemic is also a good opportunity for my colleagues and I to examine if there are areas in which we could be more efficient and still be able to meet the exhibition deadlines.
Have there been any significant changes in the paper medium over time that have also fundamentally altered the way paper conservation is done?
In the collection, I have come across the earlier handmade rag (cotton) papers that are of very good quality; later on, modern papers were mostly machine-made with wood pulp which produced lower quality papers. However, even with changes in the paper medium over time, the agents of deterioration or factors that cause damage to paper collections are largely still the same. 
People and non-ideal environments are still the major factors causing damage, such as rough handling, folding, gluing, high humidity, etc. By and large, I would say that we still use similar techniques in conserving these paper items from different periods of time. However, I have also noticed that there is a lot more awareness on sustainability, health and safety concerns on the materials used in paper conservation techniques. I think with the growing contemporary paper works in the collection, we also need to look outwards, be more creative and open about conserving paper works and see what new techniques could be adopted.
What is one of the most memorable items you've worked on?
Nine years ago, I treated a Thai manuscript (2012-00734) from the late 19th to early 20th centuries which had extensive insect damage. It left a deep impression on me because I had never seen such extensive damage by silverfish. Besides the major losses on many pages of the manuscript, it came with a lot of insect frass (insect faeces) and flattened silverfish carcass in between the pages.
While there was a lot of work involved in stabilising the manuscript for an exhibition, I had a deep sense of satisfaction treating this artefact. I removed the insect frass via vacuuming and scraping, including the dry silverfish carcass. I enjoyed in-filling the losses as well, including repairing the cover, so that the work could be safely handled and displayed in the museum thereafter.
Having been in the field for 14 years, is there a philosophy in conservation work that you might have found yourself inadvertently applying to life in general?
I think there are so many things in conservation work that can be applied to life! In the treatment process, we would usually examine the work in detail, consider the treatment aims, options, and plan our time to carry out treatments, especially for major ones. I think the greatest takeaway from that would be not to lose the big picture while looking at the finer details, to weigh the options we have, planning well ahead and not to assume things. I think being a conservator has also made me a better person as compared to 14 years agoâ€”I am more organised and have a better sense of order, which is also important for housekeeping at home!

What do you think is the biggest challenge in the field of (paper) conservation today?
I think one of the biggest challenges today is that, increasingly, conservators have to find ways to stay relevant and adapt to the changing landscape. Traditionally, the conservation profession is very hands-on, but now we have to get used to being more front-facing, especially with the rise in digital offerings, increased demand for public access and outreach programmesâ€”for example, the use of social media in the cultural sector.
Besides having conservation skills and knowledge, I think we will also need to influence and communicate more effectively with the various stakeholders. Hopefully, having an openness to acquiring new skills, a broader view and a better understanding of our organisational context will help conservators find creative ways to rise to the challenge in this brave new world!
Please share with us some tips for protecting our books in Singapore's climate!
Unfortunately, the climate in Singapore is really humid and many of the books nowadays contain wood pulp, which would easily allow acids to form in the paper. As such, our books tend to discolour easily or have foxing (yellow spots). As much as possible, keep your books far away from food sources or areas with high moisture. If possible, make sure that there is enough ventilation and that they are not closely packed.
If you intend to store them in boxes, consider archival materials that are acid-free. It is recommended to have a good dusting regimen if they are kept in open storage areas. Lastly, one can consider a digital dry box if they have precious books that they wish to keep at a lower and stable relative humidity.

Dr Michael Flecker, Visiting Fellow,
ISEAS â€“ Yusof Ishak Institute
The Empress of Asia was originally a luxury ocean liner. She was launched in 1912, one year after the Titanic. Both ships were similarly fitted out, from portholes to toilets to glistening silverware. She was requisitioned as a troop carrier during WWI, and then again in WWII.
The Empress of Asia was attacked by Japanese bombers on 5th of February 1942, on the final leg of her voyage from Bombay to Singapore. She was carrying a large contingent of British troops who were desperately needed to bolster Singapore's defences. Remarkably, the troops and crew all made it to shore, having abandoned their sinking ship off Sultan Shoal Lighthouse. Just ten days later, most were declared Prisoners of War when Singapore surrendered to Japan.
The fire ravaged capsized hull was partially salvaged after the War. The remnants were removed in 2020 to ensure navigational safety at Tuas Port. The wreck structure was documented by the National Heritage Board and a fascinating array of artefacts was recovered for research, conservation and display.

The Attack
The Japanese invasion of Singapore commenced on the 8th of February 1942. Just three days earlier, the final elements of the British Army's 18th Infantry Division arrived from Bombay in five troop carriers traveling in convoy. Not all troops disembarked in an orderly manner.
At 11 a.m. on the 5th of February the convoy came under attack as it entered Singapore Strait from the west. Japanese planes swooped in from all directions and altitudes, focusing their attention on the largest ship, the RMS Empress of Asia. She endured an hour of bombardment, taking three direct hits. Fire engulfed the entire superstructure, from the bridge to the aft funnel. Chunks of burning debris dropped into the smoke-filled engine room, forcing the engineers and firemen to retreat.
Taking advantage of the ship's dwindling momentum, Captain A B Smith swung the Empress of Asia towards the Sultan Shoal Lighthouse. Smoke and heat forced the officers to evacuate the bridge by sliding down a rope to the foredeck. The Captain was the last to leave, after throwing a steel box containing confidential documents into the sea. On reaching the deck, he gave the instruction to let go the anchor, for the last time.
Abandon Ship
Only the bow and stern remained undamaged and clear of smoke. The 2,235 troops who were mostly sheltering below deck joined the 415i ship's crew at the crowded extremities. The lifeboats were either ablaze or enveloped in smoke. Japanese planes were still flying overhead, but shortly past noon, they dispersed and small craft began coming alongside to rescue the personnel. A large number landed on the Sultan Shoal, only 500 metres away, with boats returning to the ship to pick up the next batch. The sloop Yarra rescued over 1,000 troops and crew from the stern. By 1 p.m., all personnel had been evacuated. In Captain Smith's words, â€œEveryone behaved very well indeed. There was no panic, the troops were splendid, and everyone did their job.â€ii
While not mentioned by the Captain, many personnel jumped into the sea before the rescue boats appeared. Singapore police boat commander Pestana reported picking up dozens of people, with â€œthose who could swim declining to get into the launch to make way for non-swimmersâ€.iii Machine-gunner, Bill Moylon, related how he had to jump from a great height to avoid being overwhelmed by acrid smoke, in an interview recorded in his 98th year.iv From a compilation of stories from the 125th Anti-Tank Regiment, â€œOne A.A. team from the Regiment actually jumped from their gun position on the 'fiddley-deck' into the sea after they were cut off. All men forward had to leave the ship down a 60 ft rope into the water.â€v  Sam Purvis, a military nurse with an injured knee, squeezed out of a porthole and shinned down a rope that was suspended from the rail above. He could not swim but managed to grab the handle of an inflatable raft.vi

Mopping Up
After the evacuation was completed, Captain Smith boarded HMS Sutlej and made a wide sweep round the burning hulk to make sure that no one had been overlooked by the rescue craft. If the newspaper reports were correct, he missed three. Pestana plucked them from the water while continuing his search that night. 
The Captain proceeded to Keppel Harbour, finally stepping ashore at 8 p.m. The following day, Friday the 6th of February, 127 firemen and one steward from the Empress of Asia joined two transport ships that were leaving Singapore. They were the lucky ones. The remainder of the crew were taken to a military camp. Captain Smith attempted to ascertain casualties:
â€œOn Saturday, 7th, I learned from OC [Officer Commanding] Troops that a check had been made and only 15 of his men were not accounted for but he pointed out that some of these men might have got adrift in the town after landing and might yet turn up. The only known casualty to my crew was D Ellsworthy, a Canadian Pantryman, who died in hospital from injuries and was buried in Singapore.â€
At least seven military personnel eventually succumbed to injuries sustained during the bombardment.vii These soldiers are commemorated at the Kranji War Memorial. Crewman Ellsworthy is buried there. At least eleven other crew members, and many of the transported troops, lost their lives during the course of the War. Remarkably, not one of the 2,650 people on board went down with the ship. The Empress of Asia is not a war grave.

Prisoners-of-War (POWs)
Some 133 members of the Empress of Asia's catering and medical crew continued to contribute to the war effort by serving at the General and Miyako Hospitals in Singaporeviii, where they looked after their injured shipmates, amongst the many others. With the surrender on the 15th of February, they were all interned as Prisoners of War at the Changi and Sime Road camps. Other personnel from the Empress of Asia were captured while attempting to flee Singapore for areas still under Allied control. Those captured outside Singapore were held at various locations, including Sumatra, Java, Thailand, and Malaya.
One extraordinary Empress of Asia survivor is Corporal Ras Pagani. After the Allies surrendered, he escaped from Singapore to Sumatra in a small boat and â€˜eventually fetched up at Padang'. While repairing a steam tug to make a bid for Ceylon, he and some mates were taken prisoner by the Japanese. After two months, he was shipped to Mergui with 500 others where he was put to work offloading ships and constructing airfields. He was then shifted to the dreaded Burma-Siam railway near Moulmein. He escaped and made his way in a roundabout fashion towards distant Arakan where British forces were stationed. Although he was much assisted by Karen and Burmese groups, he was finally betrayed while crossing the Irrawaddy River, shot and handed over to the Japanese. To avoid certain execution as an escapee, Pagani claimed to be a downed American airman. He was believed and saw out the war as a POW in Rangoon.ix
History of the Ship
The Empress of Asia was built by Scottish company Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering at Govan, on the River Clyde, just downstream from Glasgow. She was launched in 1912 and fully fitted out by May 1913. At 180m long and 20 m widex, she was a mid-sized liner typical of others in the fleet of the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company (CPS). CPS was fully owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and therefore could offer a through service for passengers and mail from Britain to Asia, via railway across Canada.
The Empress of Asia was requisitioned by the British Admiralty at the outbreak of WWI, just over a year after commencing scheduled voyages between Victoria in western Canada and various Asian ports.  In August of 1914, she was converted into an auxiliary cruiser with the installation of eight 4.7-inch guns. She was assigned blockade and convoy escort duties from the South China Sea to the western Indian Ocean. The liner returned to commercial service for two years, but in April 1918 she was again requisitioned, this time by the Canadian government to transport American troops to Europe. After the Armistice she carried Canadian troops home. The Empress of Asia resumed the trans-Pacific mercantile trade in February 1919 after a quick refit.xi 
Over 20 years later, the Empress of Asia was again requisitioned by the British Admiralty, this time for WWII service. She sailed from Vancouver for Britain on February 13th, 1941, via the Panama Canal. The onward voyage was by way of Jamaica and Bermuda, reaching the Firth of Clyde in Scotland in late March.xii After a brief interlude she sailed for Liverpool where modifications for troop carrying duties were undertaken.  Accommodation and cooking facilities were expanded, and armaments added, including one 6-inch gun, a 3-inch AA gun, 6 Oerlikons, 8 Hotchkiss, 4 PAC rockets, and a rack of depth charges. The refit was completed by the end of April.xiii
Her first task was to transport 2,000 soldiers of the Green Howards to Suez via the Cape of Good Hope to participate in the North Africa Campaign. From the Red Sea, she took Italian prisoners of war to Durban. In September 1941, the Empress of Asia sailed with the first convoy from North America to England, escorted by ships of the United States Navy.xiv
Her Final Voyage
After embarking troops, the Empress of Asia sailed from Liverpool for Africa on November 12th, 1941, reaching Freetown on November 26th. While enroute to Capetown, Pearl Harbour was attacked, escalating the war into Asia and the Pacific. Christmas Day was spent at Durban where orders were received to disembark the troops on board and to proceed directly to Bombay. She reached Bombay on January 15th, 1942, embarked a new complement of troops and set sail for Singapore in convoy a week later.xv
The convoy proceeded across the Indian Ocean to the Sunda Strait, where some ships broke off for Batavia (Jakarta). The rest steamed north towards Bangka Strait. While passing through this narrow waterway, a formation of Japanese planes bombed the convoy from high altitude.
The Empress of Asia recorded five near misses, with one bomb exploding only 3 m from the hull. Shrapnel pierced two of the lifeboats and white-water cascaded down onto the decks. On the afternoon of 4th February, two of the faster ships left the convoy in order to reach Singapore first thing the next morning. The remaining ships, including the Empress of Asia reached the western reaches of Singapore Strait later in the morning of the 5th. That's when the next fatal wave of bombers struck.xvi

Salvage
When inspecting his command two days after the attack, Captain Smith observed, â€œI do not think there is much chance of the Japanese salvaging the ship.â€xvii  The fire had by then spread to the coal bunkers and intensified. While extensively ravaged, the Empress of Asia had not yet sunk. The First Officer of the SS Kedah, Lieutenant Commander Allen, noted that on reaching Singapore on the morning of February 11th, they passed the â€œburned-out shell of the Empress of Asiaâ€, suggesting that she was still afloat six days after the attack.xviii  Soon afterwards, however, the hulk must have capsized and sank with her port-side down. The starboard side remained awash in 18 m of water. Red lights were later affixed as she was deemed to be a navigation hazard.
The Japanese didn't salvage the Empress of Asia during the War, but, just eight years after surrendering, they were back in Singapore offering to raise the ship. Mr Kuwabara, president of one of the biggest salvage companies in Japan, Matsukura and Company, told the Straits Times in December 1953 â€œit could be raised easilyâ€, along with other wrecks in the harbour and the wrecks of the HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales off the east coast of Malaysia.xix  The Singapore licensed salvor, the International Salvage Company, signed a contract with Matsukura in February 1954, pending the arrival of 160 Japanese salvage experts.xx  Matsukura also offered to buy all of the scrap for shipment to Tokyo. But local outrage at Japanese participation scuttled their efforts.
The Straits Times first announced that the salvage of the Empress of Asia and various other wrecks would commence in February 1952.xxi   The newly established International Salvage Company (Malaya) Ltd. erected a wooden platform on the partly exposed hull for the deployment of a generator and other equipment. In September, three men were arrested for stealing the generator.xxii 
A light-hearted piece in the Straits Times of the same month describes the camp built by the salvage crew on Pulau Sakra.xxiii  â€œThese men have come from Hongkong and a tougher and yet more personable set of men would be hard to find. Obviously, they take great pride in their skill and know the meaning of teamwork. They have built themselves a jovial camp, each hut in the shade of its own site with little paths neatly bordered in places with a patch of flowers or vegetables. But ask before you land.â€
Apart from the abortive Japanese foray into the Singapore salvage business, there is no more reporting on the Empress of Asia until January 1957. In the preceding years, the International Salvage Company had successfully cut up and removed six wrecks, along with â€œthousands of tons of metalâ€ from the Empress of Asia.xxiv  Now divers were continuing the work. In October of 1957, the Straits Times announced that blasting operations had begun. Indeed, a series of Singapore Notices to Mariners every year through to 1961, warned passing shipping that blasting and salvage operations would be taking place at the wreck site.
Recent Recoveries
In July 1998, a private diving group calling themselves Technical Diving International â€“ Asia recovered a range of artefacts from the Empress of Asia, including a 4-tonne anchor, a rusted machine-gun, porcelain, and a candlestick holder. The artefacts were donated to the then Singapore History Museum.
In 2015, a seabed debris survey, undertaken as part of preliminary works for the Tuas Mega-Port development, reconfirmed the charted wreck location off Sultan Shoal for subsequent salvage works. The position corresponded to that recorded for the Empress of Asia on 19th March 1946 in an Admiralty Notice to Mariners: 01â° 14' 09â€ N, 103â° 39' 09â€ E. The 1966 edition of Admiralty Chart 3836 depicts the wreck in the same location, to the southeast of Sultan Shoal with her bow heading west-northwest. 
This Admiralty Chart indicates that the wreck dries 6 feet (1.8 m) at low tide and lies in 10 fathoms (18.3 m) of water. However, by 1966 the wreck didn't dry at all due to the extensive salvage works. The shallowest depth of the wreck was updated regularly and charted over the years. The 2015 multi-beam sonar image clearly showed that the shallowest point was around 11 m deep with a series of parallel lines punctuating a long mound of sediment. During an archaeological diving survey carried out in early 2016 by the ISEAS â€“ Yusof Ishak Institute (ISEAS), on behalf of the National Heritage Board, it was confirmed that the lines were the edges of decks fully exposed after the removal of the starboard hull plating. Furthermore, some 50 metres of the bow, almost all the superstructure, all the boilers and turbines, and much of the keel were now missing. Well over half of the ship had been salvaged, and the exposed remnants were severely corroded.
The wreckage lay within the navigation channel for the upcoming Tuas Port. Wreck removal proceeded with NHB and ISEAS personnel documenting identifiable structural elements and recovering historically significant objects for research and conservation.
These include structural fittings such as portholes, valves and davits, and cabin fixtures such as taps, wall lamps and doorknob assemblies. There are the accoutrements of fine dining such as silverware cutlery and trays, along with porcelain cups and dishes. These artefacts are linked to the ship and her colourful history since she was launched in 1912.
Artefacts Tell The Story
The NHB engaged in discussions with the UK Foreign Commonwealth Office and the Department for Transport, in recognition of the UK Government's ownership of the vessel and its artefacts. Selected artefacts were loaned for an exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore. 
The Empress of Asia was one of many luxury ocean liners traversing the oceans during a period regarded as the golden age of travel, at least by first-class travellers.  The Titanic was launched only a year earlier than the Empress of Asia. She was built in Belfast, Ireland, a short hop across the Irish Channel from the Govan shipyards. Many companies supplied the same components for the fitout of both ships. Several artefacts from the Empress of Asia are identical to those recovered from the Titanic lying 3,800 metres deep in the tempestuous Atlantic.
Military artefacts recovered from the Empress of Asia include a paraffin blow lamp embossed with a broad arrow, brass webbing and the remnants of Lee Enfield rifles. Stores include glass bottles for beer, wine and condiments. Personal effects such as a pocket watch perhaps belonged to one of the ship's officers. Military hardware and stores could have been loaded at various ports during the final deployment, from Liverpool to Durban to Bombay. Non-perishables may have remained on board from as far back as the requisition in Vancouver.
These artefacts along with photographs of identifiable hull remains tell the stories of the last journey of the Empress of Asia. The Empress of Asia will not be forgotten.

About the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme
The Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme is a collaborative effort between NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries, and local shop owners in their respective precincts to strengthen partnerships with communities and raise awareness of and foster deeper appreciation for heritage in everyday spaces.
The scheme allows NHB to work closely with local shop owners with at least 30 years of history in selected precincts to co-create â€œmini museumsâ€ that showcase the history and heritage of their respective businesses and trades. Located on site, these galleries will display historical documents, photographs, and artefacts that tell the stories of these shops.
On top of providing funding, curatorial support and assistance in fabricating the showcases, NHB will also work with local shop owners to develop programmes such as talks, tours, and workshops, and provide opportunities to participate in key NHB events such as the Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective CultureFests of the heritage institutions within their precincts.

Legacy of a Tekka Butchery: SIS Premium Meats
For more than 60 years, SIS Premium Meats has been supplying quality meat to customers at Little India. The business was founded by Sinnasamy Irudayasamy, who arrived in Singapore from Tamil Nadu in 1949 to work in a coffee shop and subsequently at a mutton stall. Sinnasamy opened his own mutton stall, named S I Samy, in 1953 in the old Tekka Market. 
S I Samy's customer base and reputation grew further when the stall moved in 1982, along with the rest of the market, across the road to the present Tekka Centre. As S I Samy's clients are mainly Hindu and Muslim, the business refrained from stocking beef or pork to respect the dietary requirements of its customers. 
In 1983, S I Samy was registered as S I Samy Trading Company Pte Ltd as it expanded into the wholesale distribution of mutton to other wet markets, restaurants and caterers. The company's mutton supplies also diversified and imports arrived from Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America and Brazil via ship and air freight. 
In 2018, S I Samy was rebranded as SIS Premium Meats. Today, this family-owned business is managed by Sinnasamy's daughter, Joyce Kingsly. As a child, Joyce often accompanied her father at his market stall and watched him interact with customers. When Joyce took over the business in 1995, she broadened the types of products to include chicken and seafood, and offered more services including home delivery.
This photograph from the 1970s shows the stall's old sign board at Tekka Centre, which carries the founder's name in English and Tamil.
From Street Stall to Textile Empire: Haniffa Textiles
Noted for its large collection of intricate saris, few might know that Haniffa Textiles first began operations as a small roadside stall along Campbell Lane. The textile business was founded by O. K. Mohammed Haniffa, who arrived in Singapore in 1957 and worked various odd jobs, before starting his own textile business. Within a decade, the business moved from the pavements into a shophouse unit, before finally settling in a building on the same street.  
In the beginning, Haniffa sold the lighter Japan-made nylex sari that was popular for everyday use. He also developed a partnership with several major Japanese sari producers and became their sole distributor in Singapore and India. However, as the taste, preferences, and spending habits of Singapore Indian women changed, many preferred pattu (silk) saris for festive occasions. In response, Haniffa established contacts with distributors across India to meet rising consumer demand.
Over the decades, Haniffa Textiles diversified and expanded its business to keep up with customer needs. It acquired units on Serangoon Road and Dunlop Street, and sold men's garments, dry provisions and kitchenware to cater to the domestic market, as well as luggage bags and gift items for those travelling or returning to South Asia.
Today, Haniffa Textiles has branches in Malaysia and offices in India run by the second generation of the Haniffa family, including the founder's son, Abdul Samad Haniffa, and daughter, Razinah Begum Haniffa. Even as the company grows, the Haniffa name remains synonymous with quality saris for many Singaporean Indian households.
This photograph taken in 1962 shows founder O. K. Mohammed Haniffa (pictured in the centre) standing by his roadside stall at Campbell Lane.
A Century-Old Vegetarian Tradition: Ananda Bhavan
Ananda Bhavan is one of the oldest Indian vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. The restaurant was founded by Kulanthaivelu Muthusamy Kaunder, who, with his brothers, set up the eatery when they came to Singapore in the 1920s. 
In the early years, Kulanthaivelu and his family lived on the second floor above the restaurant, and family members took on various roles such as cleaning tables and handling accounts. From its inception, Ananda Bhavan had always served vegetarian cuisine, starting with rice scooped onto a banana leaf and accompanied with vegetable sides, which made for an affordable meal for labourers in the early decades. 
In the 1950-60s after Kulanthaivelu's demise, his brother-in-law Ramasamy took over the restaurant before handing the reins to Kulanthaivelu's wife, Kaliammal. The establishment later came under the management of Kulanthaivelu's sons, M. K. Ramachandra and K. Nadarajan, who introduced automation in the kitchen to improve productivity. Under their management, the restaurant was one of the first in Little India to introduce a self-service ordering model, where customers ordered food at the cashier counter. 
Today, Ananda Bhavan is managed by Kulanthaivelu's grandson Viren Ettikan, who took over in 2011. In recent times, Ananda Bhavan opened more outlets and introduced Jain- and vegan-friendly dishes, as well as novel fusion cuisine. Although Ananda Bhavan is quick to embrace technology and innovation, it remains rooted to its tradition of serving quality vegetarian food to its customers.
This photograph from the 1970s shows Ananda Bhavan when it was at Ellison Building, and includes second generation proprietors, K. Nadarajan (third from left) and M. K. Ramachandra behind the cashier's counter on the right.
Household Name for Traditional Essentials: Jothi Store and Flower Shop
Often described as a one-stop shop for everything related to Indian culture and tradition, Jothi Store and Flower Shop is a familiar name to the Indian community in Singapore. The store was established in 1960 as an ottukadai (hole in the wall shop) by former compositor and librarian, Murugaia Ramachandra. Named after the founder's daughter, the store started out by selling sundry goods and everyday necessities to the Indian labouring class residing in Little India. 
Given the store's proximity to Hindu temples on Serangoon Road, Ramachandra noticed a demand for flower garlands used in religious offerings. A family friend was thus engaged as a garland maker, and with the help of his brother, Ramachandra worked to meet an ever-growing demand for flowers and religious paraphernalia, and for domestic necessities. 
Over time, Jothi Store and Flower Shop gained a reputation for its wide selection of items used in Indian religious ceremonies and rituals. The store also organises its array of prayer and decorative items according to the calendar of religious and cultural festivals observed by the local Indian community. In addition, Jothi Store actively procures new products to expand the range of everyday items that are sought after by the Indian community.
In 1981, Jothi Store and Flower Shop relocated into part of its present location at 1 Campbell Lane, before expanding and eventually occupying the entire building by 1992. Today, the store is managed by Ramachandra's son, Rajakumar Chandra, who continues to personally serve the throngs of customers who patronise this bustling five-storey emporium in Little India.
This is Jothi Store's iconic blue carrier bag and it features a printed design that has been used since the 1970s.
Keeping it Spicy: Thandapani Co Pte Ltd
From turmeric and nutmeg to sadhakuppai (a type of cumin seed) and sajeera (caraway seeds), spices are common ingredients used to enhance flavour in Asian cooking. Since the 1960s, Thandapani Co has been stocking a wide variety of spices, including those rarely found in local supermarkets, as well as signature house mixes for popular Indian dishes.
Thandapani Co was founded by Sanmugam, who came to Singapore in 1946 and worked at his uncle's shop in Little India, before starting a spice business in Little India Arcade in the 1960s. Named after Sanmugam's favourite Hindu deity, Thandapani Co focused on selling spices until the 1970s, when it relocated to Campbell Lane and bought over Valli Flour Mills. This enabled Sanmugam to offer spice grinding and spice mixes based on his own recipes, and these recipes have remained popular with home chefs and restaurants in Little India.
Over the years, Thandapani Co's customer base has expanded to include Chinese restaurants and Malay families, as spices are widely used across different types of Asian cuisines. The business also supplies spices to Hindu and Buddhist temples, Sikh gurdwaras (temples), mosques and welfare homes, which often prepare meals for underserved communities.
Today, Thandapani Co is managed by the second-generation descendants of Sanmugam's family, who have retained the traditional look-and-feel of the shop and continues to offer quality spices to the diverse communities of Little India and beyond.
This photograph taken in 1986 shows Thandapani Co's storefront at its former location at 16 Campbell Lane.
Family Food Legacy: Komala Vilas
Founded in 1947, generations of patrons have been flocking to Komala Vilas to enjoy its Indian vegetarian food. The restaurant was established by Murugiah Rajoo, who worked at Sri Karuna Vilas, the former restaurant that occupied this unit. When the owners decided to return to India after World War II, Murugiah bought over the business and renamed the eatery in honour of his boss' wife.
Operating as a family business, Murugiah's family members took on various roles to ensure that the restaurant ran smoothly. Affectionately known as â€œthe lieutenantâ€, his brother Sinnakannu kept the business running, while Murugiah's children and grandchildren learned the trade by working the restaurant floor from an early age. More staff were hired as the business expanded, and Komala Vilas is known to be amongst the first eateries in Little India to employ women in a customer-facing role as cashiers.
In the 1950s, Komala Vilas took over the neighbouring two-storied unit at 78 Serangoon Road, and in the 1970s, it became the first restaurant in Little India to offer an air-conditioned dining area on the second floor. The restaurant also diversified its South Indian menu and in the 1970s, introduced bhatura (a Punjabi dish) for the first time.
From the 1990s, Komala Vilas came under the charge of the founder's son, Rajoo Gunasekaran, until 2015, when Murugiah's grandson, Rajakumar Gunasekaran, took over. Since then, the third-generation proprietor has introduced North Indian vegetarian favourites to Komala Vilas' menu, and started Fennel, a modern Indian vegetarian restaurant at 413 River Valley Road.
This photograph from the 1960s shows a group posing in front of Komala Vilas, which had by then expanded to two units with seating on both the lower and upper floors.
Jeweller to Brides and Businessmen: Ani Mani
Ani Mani, which means â€œto adorn with jewelsâ€ in Tamil, has been decking its clientele with traditional Indian ornaments, gold jewellery and gems since 1948. Founders Rathnavelu and his brothers established the porchalai(jewellery shop) as they saw potential in the gold trade in Little India. For its customers, Ani Mani is the go-to goldsmith for traditional jewellery such as the thali(wedding pendant).
Ani Mani's customers purchase gold jewellery for a myriad of reasons, such as for investment, for use in religious ceremonies, and/or as family heirlooms. For the Indian community, the practice of buying gold during the spring festival of Akshaya Tritiya has become more popular as it is believed to be an auspicious day that would bring about increased wealth and prosperity.
Since its inception, Ani Mani has been renowned for casting the thali, a symbolic ornament worn by a bride to mark her marriage. According to South Asian tradition, each thali is customised according to the families' regional and religious specifications. The commissioning of a thali is so significant that families typically consult the almanac for auspicious dates and times to order and collect the thali. Ani Mani also routinely conducts a prayer session at their in-store altar when Hindu families come to collect their commissioned thali.
Besides gold jewellery, Ani Mani is also a purveyor of gemstones, which are traditionally worn among South Asians for luck in business and life. Ani Mani's in-house gemologists pair their customers with the right gemstones based on their birth chart, as every gem is believed to correspond to one of the nine cosmic bodies according to Vedic astrology. Today, Ani Mani is managed by the third-generation descendants of Rathnavelu's family, who continue to craft customised jewellery that hold personal significance to their customers.
This goldsmith torch is used to melt gold fragments held in this ceramic melting dish. The gold is then remoulded and shaped into the desired jewellery design.


Delicacies on Leaves: The Banana Leaf Apolo
As its name suggests, The Banana Leaf Apolo is well known for upholding the South Indian tradition of serving food on banana leaves since its establishment in 1974. The restaurant's founder, S. Chellappan, picked up cooking from his father, who was a chef for businessman and philanthropist P. Govindasamy Pillai. Wanting to put his culinary skills to use, Chellappan dipped his hands into the food business with a small thosai stall, before establishing his own restaurant at 24 Cuff Road.
From its inception, The Banana Leaf Apolo was known for its fish head curry, a locally invented dish that was fast gaining popularity amongst diners. Using an undisclosed recipe comprising a secret blend of spices and pineapple, the fruity and savoury curry dish quickly became a signature dish for the restaurant and attracted both local and international patrons.
The Banana Leaf Apolo relocated to Race Course Road in 1983, and with its growing popularity, quickly expanded from a one-unit restaurant to one that encompasses three units. The restaurant also increased its menu items and introduced North Indian dishes. Riding on its success, it opened another branch at Little India Arcade, and three more in 2020 at Sixth Avenue, Rivervale Mall and Downtown East.
Today, The Banana Leaf Apolo is under the management of Chellappan's son, C. Sankaranathan, who, with his wife S. Rajeswari, also oversees Apollo Sellappas, the departmental store founded by the family in 2008. Despite its growing chain of eateries, the food business remains a family affair, with Rajeswari personally checking on the quality of the eateries' masala mix, and their son, S. Nirmal Raj overseeing the newest branches.

Built: 1907
Restored: 2001â€“03
Located on Dunlop Street in the heart of Little India, Abdul Gafoor Mosque was built in 1907 to serve the Tamil Muslim community working and living in the area. It was established by Shaik Abdul Gafoor bin Shaik Hyder, a Tamil Muslim chief clerk at a law firm. Today, the mosque is one of six mosques in Singapore that mainly offer Tamil sermons.
Masjid Abdul Gafoor at Dunlop Street, early 20th century
National Museum of Singapore Collection
The architecture of the mosque is an eclectic mix of neoclassical and Saracenic elements. During the 1990s, the mosque committee planned to add a single-storey extension to increase the capacity of the prayer hall. In the process, the structural integrity of the mosque was found to be compromised, and this spurred a major restoration project completed in 2003. 
To reinforce the foundation, micro-piles were used to underpin the structure. At the same time, an underground vault that had been thought to be a storage areaâ€”later revealed to be a spacious basement according to the original blueprint of the mosqueâ€”was deepened and expanded to become a proper basement.
The newly air-conditioned basement was refurbished with its interior sensitively designed to align with the existing architecture of the mosque. For instance, a void was built between the basement and the main prayer hall above to allow visual and physical continuity. In addition to the basement, which provided more space for worshippers, a new single-storey prayer hall was constructed in the same style beside the main prayer hall. Following the expansion, the mosque can now accommodate 3,000 worshippers.
The main prayer hall features a void that looks down into the basement.
The restoration process also reinstated formerly lost architectural features, such as the minarets, the boundary wall and plaster details. Four minarets that were in the original blueprint but had been lost over time were rebuilt, each located at a corner of the roof. The exquisite Saracenic cinquefoil arches were restored, while finer details such as the decorative plasterworks of intricate calligraphy on pillars were skilfully recreated by artisans and craftsmen. During restoration, coloured-glass decoration on the columns was uncovered, and this elegant feature now sees the light of day.
Intricate plaster details, including the calligraphy, were repaired and replicated.

On the mosque's exterior, its off-white walls were given fresh coats of eye-catching yellow and green paint, revitalising the facade. The mosque was repainted white and green in 2021. One of the iconic features of the mosque is the sunburst pattern above the entrance, with the Arabic inscription of the names of 25 major Islamic prophets.
Minarets that had been removed over the years were reinstated, restoring the Abdul Gaffoor Mosque to its original glory.
Today, the Abdul Gafoor Mosque stands as a monument of pride for the Tamil Muslim community in Singapore. Visitors stream in from all corners of the world to marvel at the unique architecture with its fine, exquisite details. The remarkable restoration of the Abdul Gafoor Mosque, which saw its expansion carried out with meticulous care, earned it the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Architectural Heritage Award in 2003.

Tucked away in the leafy, quiet neighbourhood of Oxley Rise, the Chesed-El Synagogue is one of two synagogues in Singapore, the other being the Maghain Aboth Synagogue, that cater to the small Jewish community numbering around 2,500. The Chesed-El was established by Manesseh Mayer in 1905, a prominent Jewish merchant and philanthropist in Singapore, to accommodate worshippers after the Maghain Aboth had become overcrowded as the local Jewish population had ballooned over the decades since the latter opened in 1878. Meyer, who came to Singapore in the mid-1800s, had also been involved in the construction of the Maghain Aboth.

The neoclassical Chesed-El was designed by R.A.J. Bidwell of eminent colonial architectural firm Swan and Maclaren. The building's facade boasts elaborate floral plasterwork, continuous cornices and heavy embellishments. Adding to the majesty of the edifice is a three-arched carriage porch at the entrance with Corinthian columns as well as tall arched windows found all throughout the building. Directly opposite the entrance is the ark, where Torah scrolls are stored, facing westward towards Jerusalem.
In 2016, with grants from the National Monuments Fund, the Chesed-El embarked on a major restoration project. It carried out structural strengthening works on its historical cantilever reinforced-concrete canopies to prevent them from collapsing. After engaging experts to carry out studies on the issue, the synagogue decided to respond to age-old structural issues with innovative engineering solutionsâ€”such as the insertion of rectangular hollow section steel beam structures and using lightweight materials to reduce loading stress on the canopies.
Rectangular hollow section steel beams were installed to the inner face of the canopy.  The original 325mm-thick slab is replaced by a 15mm-thick plate to reduce loading stress on the canopy.
The modern techniques ensured the stability of the canopies in the long run, without needing to reconstruct the canopies. Significantly, the works were executed with minimal impact to the historic ornamental features on the canopies. Besides strengthening the canopies, the synagogue also fixed leaking roofs as well as installed new reinforced floor slabs and marble slabs that were identical to the original marble flooring. In addition, the building received a new coat of paint.

In 2019, the Chesed-El again received financial assistance from the National Monuments Fund and managed to carry out works for micro-piling and reinforcing a retaining wall behind the edifice. 
Today, the synagogue continues to play central role in the Jewish community in Singapore, hosting religious festivals and events such as the Passover, Hanukkah as well as Bar Mitzvahs and Bat Mitzvahs.

Built: 1902â€“08
Restored: 1991â€“2001
Built in the early 1900s, the Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery (former Siong Lim Temple) houses one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Singapore. It was built on land donated by influential businessman and devout Buddhist Low Kim Pong; today, the monastery is nestled amidst high-rise public housing flats in Toa Payoh. 
There are three main buildings in the monastery. The main prayer hall, known as the Mahavira Hall (or Daxiong Baodian), was constructed in 1904, while the entrance hall, called the Tian Wang Dian, was built the following year. These two structures were gazetted collectively as a national monument. In 1903, the Dharma Hall was completed; however, this was rebuilt in the 1970s due to structural deterioration. Decades later, the Dharma Hall was again rebuilt according to its original architectural style from 1903, and this new structure was completed in 2016.
The Mahavira Hall, 1950s. The upper tier of the roof is constructed in the Fuzhou style, featuring a steeper angle at the corners, while the lower tier is built in the Quanzhou style, with a gentler angle.
Modelled after the historic Xichan Temple in Fuzhou, China, the monastery follows the traditional conglin layout in which the various structures are symmetrical in plan, separated by courtyards and usually face the north-south direction with the entrance facing the south, according to fengshui principles. The conglin layout is meant to instil monastic discipline. 
The overall architecture adopts a traditional Hokkien style, with a blend of Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou characteristics apparent across the various structures in the complex. For instance, the sharply curved corners on the roof are typical of the Fuzhou style, while the other buildings have bigger, heavier roofs with corners that curve at a gentler angle, which are distinctive Quanzhou features. These two architectural styles are seen in the double-tier roof of the Mahavira Hall: the upper-tier is of the Fuzhou idiom, while the lower-tier is Quanzhou style. The Zhangzhou style can be glimpsed in the roof of the Tian Wang Dian. It is very similar to its Quanzhou counterpart; the only difference is that the roof of the former has a steeper slope and a more complex roof truss.
Built in 1905, the entrance hall, Tian Wang Dian, is one of the three main buildings in the monastery.
From the 1990s up to the 2000s, the monastery carried out a series of restoration works to repair much of its structures which had fallen into disrepair. Significantly, the Bell and Drum Towers, which had been rebuilt in the 1970s, suffered from spalling concrete and had to be demolished and reconstructed. The temple committee consulted traditional architecture experts, and extensive research was conducted to recreate the towers, using photographs from the 1900s as a reference. 
Modern technology and materials were employed to ensure that the finer architectural details specific to the Fuzhou style, such as the elegant upswing of the roof eaves, would be rendered in a way that could withstand the test of time. Wall motifs that had originally been made of clay and mortar were recreated on granite for a longer lifespan. For the same reason, Chengal timber, which is more termite-resistant, was chosen instead of the original Chinese fir.

In the mid-2000s, the monastery experienced water leakage in its roof. The roof tiles had been laid 20 years ago using the traditional wet-lay method whereby a mortar bed held the tiles on the pitched roof. However, this method was not appropriate for Singapore's tropical climateâ€”hairline cracks formed on the mortar and roof tiles over time, leading to water leakage. In planning for the reconstruction of the Dharma Hall in 2008, the monastery consulted their Buddhist architectural adviser from Hong Kong, the Venerable Wang Fun, who advised adopting the dry-lay method for the roof tile installation, while a Japanese roof tile manufacturer was also roped in to provide details on the installation.
Demonstration of the dry-lay method. As can be seen, there is no roof cement screed and plasterwork; instead, the tiles are laid in an interlocking pattern on the new lightweight aluminium roof battens.
Eventually, the supporting frame for the tiles was secured on the timber frame underneath with fasteners, and all timber structures beneath were protected by a water-tight roof. The dry-lay method was employed to replace the roof tiles for the Dharma Hall, spanning some 7,000 m2, and it has proven to achieve a very high degree of watertightness.
The Dharma Hall today is a reconstruction of the original architecture from 1903. The building was officially opened in 2016.
After more than two decades of restoration to its weathered structures, the Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery today proudly presents a fresh face to visitors from all over the world.

Located at the same site since 1836, St Andrew's Cathedral is the oldest Anglican church in Singapore. The present neo-Gothic structure was constructed in the 1850s, after the demolition of the previous building as it had been found to be structurally unsound due to lightning damage.

The old bell
In 1889, Captain J.S.H. Fraser of the East India Company presented the cathedral with a peal of eight bells in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of Raffles's landing in Singapore. Each bell is named after an apostle of Jesus: Matthew, James, John, Paul, Peter, Thomas, Bartholomew and Andrew. They are rung every Sunday as a call to worship as well as for weddings, funerals, Easter and Christmas. For more than a century, the tolls of the bells have been an invisible but integral part of the city's aural-scape, contributing to the civic district's heritage of sounds.
The original eight bells before they were shipped off to England to be refurbished. The bells, which have been with the Cathedral since 1889, had been built to be struck with the clapper, which did not produce a sound as majestic as that of change ringing.

However, the full potential of these bells was undiscovered all this timeâ€”until 1973 when Laith Reynolds, an Australian bellringing expert, visited the cathedral during a transit on the way to Indonesia. Reynolds was armed with rich experience in change ringingâ€”the traditional means of bell ringing in Anglican churches by swinging the bells through an arc of 360 degrees or more to achieve a fuller sound. By controlling the speed at which they are swung, the tuned bells can be rung in various sequences, producing a rich cascade of sound. And the more bells there are, the more complex and majestic are the sounds produced.
During his visit, Reynolds noticed that the set of bells in St Andrew's Cathedral had in fact been cast to the change ringing scale, but the bells were being chimed instead. The bells were cast without suspension loops, with flat tops bolted to the frame. Their clappers were tied so that they had to be struck to chime instead of being swung. This was a less expensive way of hanging the bells, but also one that limited them from making a full swing to create the glorious wash of sound that they had originally been made for. 
He thus embarked on a decades-long journey of working with the cathedral to restore this precious set of bells in order to perform the exquisite art of change ringing. He had the support of the local clergy, who also firmly believed in the historical, symbolic and spiritual significance of church bells whose peals signify the reverberation of the church beyond its grounds.
After a series of delays and setbacks, eventually in December 2018 the eight bells were shipped off to the foundry John Taylor and Co. in Loughborough, England, to be refurbished. An additional five new bells were cast. At the same time, the cathedral's bell tower underwent repair and restoration works to accommodate the new set of bells. Six months later in June 2019, the set of 13 bellsâ€”freshly tuned and with new headstocksâ€”returned home to St Andrew's Cathedral.
The refurbished bells and five new ones were returned to St Andrew's Cathedral on 28 June 2019. Each of the bells is named after an apostle, and the largest bell is Andrew, which weighs an impressive 1,297 kg.
One of the bells being hoisted into place back home in the Cathedral. The bells have since been mounted on the new frame that allows for change ringing. Now, the bells swing through a near 360-degree arc, producing a rich cascade of sound.
The heaviest of the set is the Andrew bell, which weighs a whopping 1,297 kg, while the lightest is Simon, cutting a relatively slim figure at 198.5 kg. The first-ever change ringing with the bells in Singapore took place on 11 August 2019. The bells at St Andrew's Cathedral are the only complete set of bells capable of change ringing in Southeast Asia.
St Andrew's Cathedral was among the first eight National Monuments gazetted in 1973. With its tall steeple housing a collection of bells, it is a distinct part of Singapore's Civic District skyline.

Rebuilt: 1970s

The Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple on Serangoon Road has roots dating back to 1855, when the original temple building was constructed. In 1851, a group of prominent Indian community leadersâ€”such as Arunachala Pillay, Cootaperumal Pillay, Ramasamy Pillay, Appasamy Pillay, Chockalingam Pillay, and Ramasamy Jamidarâ€”purchased a plot of land to build a temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Sri Perumal, also known as Vishnu. The Narasimha Perumal Temple, as it was known then, was rebuilt in the 1950s as it had fallen into disrepair, and the new structure, renamed Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, was completed in 1966.

The most iconic feature of the temple is the majestic five-tier gopuram (entrance tower) with depictions of Vishnu and other Hindu deities, visible from a distance. The prayer hall features exquisite relief carvings and mandalas in a striking array of colours. Located in the main sanctum, where only priests are admitted, is a statue of Srinivasa Perumal, and various avatars of Vishnu can be found throughout the temple.
The majestic gopuram (entrance tower) of Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple after restoration. As it is impractical to clean the gopuram regularly, a herbal concoction consisting of asafoetida, turmeric and lime powder is used to deal with unwanted vegetation growing on the structure.
In the last major restoration of the temple, carried out from 2017 to 2018, a notable aspect was the use of traditional natural treatments for various commonplace problems such as pests and weeds. Conservation experts from India had been invited to share their knowledge on these centuries-old methods for maintaining temple structures. Besides being safe, non-toxic alternatives for humans, the use of these treatment methods allows for the timely and consistent maintenance of temple structures, which in turn helps to avoid the hefty costs that may be incurred later when deterioration has gone too far and more extensive work is required.
The height of the gopuram makes it an attractive resting spot for birds, which in turn leave behind seeds of fruits that they consume. Over time, as vegetation accumulates on the tower, it causes damage to the structure. A natural solution to prevent unwanted vegetation is the use of asafoetida, turmeric and lime powder mixed into a paste. A cut or hole is made at the bottom of a weed or tree stem, and the paste is applied to the area. After application, the vegetation typically withers within two weeks. The use of such a method for vegetation removal proves particularly useful for the top of the gopuram where regular cleaning is very difficult.

To treat pests, the naturally occurring boric acid is used as an insecticide against termites, silverfish and ants, among others. It can prevent wet and dry rot in timber; when used in combination with an ethylene glycol carrier, it can be applied on the surface of wood to prevent fungal growth and insect attacks. Protecting the wood with such preventive methods minimises the need to replace the timber due to deterioration, which is costly and labour-intensive.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Geylang-Serai-Heritage-Gallery,"Introduction
Geylang Serai conventionally refers to the area of businesses and residences surrounding Geylang Serai Market. It is an area that stretches eastwards from Paya Lebar Road to Jalan Eunos, and includes the social, industrial and commercial spaces along Geylang Road, Changi Road, Sims Avenue, as well as minor roads within the area.
During the first half of the 19th century, Geylang Serai was one of the earliest settlements to spread out from Singapore Town (known today as the Civic District). The area started out with small farm holdings and larger plantations cultivating rice, lemongrass, citronella and coconut before it was transformed into a bustling centre of commerce as well as a residential suburb. 
Curated by Malay Heritage Centre, with support from the Malay Heritage Foundation, the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery presents an overview of the area's history and heritage through the use of archival materials and historical objects, many of which are on loan from Kampong Ubi Community Centre Malay Museum. The gallery also features the experiences, memories and contributions of past and present residents of Geylang Serai.

GEYLANG SERAI: AT THE CROSSROADS OF HISTORY AND MEMORY
The Origins of â€œGeylangâ€ and â€œSeraiâ€ 
The term â€œGeylangâ€ is derived from Geylang River and some of the earliest spellings of â€œGeylangâ€ found in early 19th century Dutch and British maps were â€œGellangâ€ and â€œGelangâ€. These spellings indicate that Geylang River was likely named after a specific tribe of the Orang Laut (sea nomads) who settled along the river banks and originally hailed from islands in the Riau archipelago. The current spelling of â€œGeylangâ€ was formalised only in the 1930s when the colonial government started using the spelling in survey maps.
â€œSeraiâ€ refers to the lemongrass and citronella plants cultivated in late 19th century in a plantation called Perseverance Estate. This plantation was located between Paya Lebar Road and Jalan Eunos, and, for a time, was only accessible by Geylang Road. As a result of the plantation's success between the 1860s and 1890s, the area became closely associated with lemongrass and citronella.

A Short Agricultural History
The establishment of a British free trade port in 1819 was followed by the deliberate cultivation of land beyond Singapore Town.  Between the 1830s and the early 1900s, many of the eastern districts of the island including Geylang, consisted of plantations cultivated by enterprising agriculturalists who experimented with a variety of cash crops, such as cotton, coffee, copra, sugar, nutmeg, gambier and pepper. 
The most prominent agricultural enterprise in Geylang was the successful cultivation of lemongrass and citronella during the 1860s to 1880s which led to the area being known as â€œGeylang Seraiâ€. Despite the decline of the essential oils industry by the 1890s, the area's association with lemongrass and citronella had become so ingrained in public memory that the name persisted beyond the plantation's existence.

Geylang Serai as an Expanding Residential Suburb
Between the 1920s and 1930s, rising rentals and cost-of-living in Singapore Town area led to people settling in other parts of the island, including Geylang Serai. The growing population resulted in the provision of public amenities to meet the needs of its residents. These public amenities include a new road parallel to Geylang Road called Sims Avenue, completed in 1924 and trolley buses replacing the electric tram in 1926. In 1929, a fire station was builti at the junction of Paya Lebar Road and Sims Avenue, and in 1938, the Changi and Joo Chiat Markets were built to replace existing markets. In 1934, Geylang Serai was described in a newspaper report as a â€œvery thickly populated villageâ€.

The Malay Community of Geylang Serai
â€œOnly the other day I met a young man in the Malay Settlement, Geylang Serai, who talks familiarly of New York, San Francisco and Capetown [sic]. And a similarly wide knowledge of the world lies behind many a poorly dressed Singapore Malay who looks as though he has never been outside his own kampong.â€
- The Straits Times, 16 March 1937

Although it was developed much later than areas such as Kampong Gelam and Telok Blangah, Geylang Serai has long been associated with the Malay community of Singapore. The existence of a â€œMalay Burying Groundâ€ in an 1844 map indicates a settled Malay community in the upstream tributaries of Geylang River (near present-day intersection of Geylang Road, Paya Lebar Road and Guillemard Road). 
The Malay/Muslim identity of Geylang Serai was strengthened by the employment of Javanese Muslim pilgrims returning from the Hajj as contract labour on Perseverance Estate during the late 19th century. As with other migrant communities, they established their own places of worship. The establishment of several mosques around Geylang Serai by the first half of the 20th century reinforced the substantial Muslim presence in and around Geylang Serai. Masjid Khalid was established in 1917 along Joo Chiat Road, Masjid Khadijah was built three years later in 1920 along Geylang Road, and Masjid Wak Tanjong in 1938, near the fire station along Paya Lebar Road.
From the 1920s, the expansion of commercial activities in Singapore Town and preparations for the construction of Kallang Airport led to the relocation of several Malay kampung communities from the Kallang and Geylang Rivers to different parts of the island. A number of the affected families became the first residents of the Jalan Eunos Malay Settlement, established northeast of Geylang Serai between the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Cosmopolitan Nature of Geylang Serai Malays
Geylang Serai is popularly presented as a sprawling rural area where agriculturalists, fishermen and hawkers lived and worked. In reality, Geylang Serai, similar to Kampong Gelam and Telok Blangah, was a densely populated urban kampung connected to Singapore's international trade and shippint entrepot. Besides mercantile activity, Malays found employment in government, shipping, entertainment, journalism and service-related industries. In general trade and travel exposed Malays to contemporary developments in the region and the world. Hence, many in the Malay community in Geylang Serai had a sophisticated worldview which was reflected in their lifestyles. 
Bangsawan was a popular form of entertainment in Singapore between 1910s and 1940s. There were several bangsawan troupes that were active in Singapore and Malaya during the early 20th century which was considered to be the golden age of bangsawan. Notable troupes included Wayang Kassim, Nahar Opera Company, Star Opera, Dean's Grand Opera and Borneo Star Opera.

International Taste in Entertainment
As Geylang Serai transformed into a bustling suburb, demand for entertainment grew. Up until the 1920s-30s, traveling troupes of musicians and actors entertained the masses in public squares or halls. Later, cinemas operating in Geylang Serai screened films as diverse as Malayan and Indonesian productions to films from India, Hongkong and Hollywood, reflecting audience's cosmopolitan taste in entertainment. These cinemas included Wembley Cinema in 1930 (renamed Ritz in 1933 and Queen's Theatre in 1939), and Apollo Cinema (renamed Regal in 1935, then Garrick Theatre in 1936).

LIVING IN GEYLANG SERAI
A Place Many Call Home
Since the early 20th century, Geylang Serai has been home to many Singaporeans living in kampungs once found along old roads such as Lorong Engku Aman, Jalan Tengah and Jalan Alsagoff.
The area's transformation into a modern satellite town started with the 1962 Redevelopment Plan. This plant resulted in the iconic Blocks 1, 2 and 3, the original Pasar Baru (New Market) and Geylang Serai Vocational School.
The next redevelopment phase began in the 1970s, which relocated an estimated 100,000 kampung residents to new HDB homes, and constructed Tanjong Katong and Joo Chiat shopping complexes as well as Eunos and Kampong Ubi industrial estates. 
Since the 2000s, Geylang Serai has been further improved with new HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) residences (aptly named Sri Geylang Serai), a new two-storey market and food centre, and Wisma Geylang Serai â€“ a vibrant civic hub dedicated to bringing the arts, culture, heritage and community services closer to residents.

Communities of Faith
â€œOur family resided next to Masjid Aminah at 25C Jalan Labu. Those were the days where we would spend our nights at the mosque, for it was also home to us.â€
- Haji Mohd Ali Suri, former noja (caretaker) at Masjid Aminah

In Geylang Serai, the mosque, surau and madrasah have long been important community institutions. There were a number of early mosques, surau and informal religious schools in the area, and one of the more significant mosques in Geylang Serai was Masjid Aminah, which was located at Jalan Labu. Today, the major mosques serving Geylang Serai are Masjid Khalid at Joo Chiat Road, Masjid Wak Tanjong at Paya Lebar Road and Masjid Darul Aman at Jalan Eunos. 
There were a handful of Chinese Taoist temples and ancestral halls located in Geylang Serai from the 1960s to early 2000s, the most prominent of which was Leong Nam Temple at Jalan Pasar Baru. Leong Nam Temple's colourful celebrations of Chinese festivals in the heart of Geylang Serai serve as a good example of multicultural Singapore where different communities practise their faiths harmoniously side-by-side.

Journey to Makkah
The pilgrimage to Makkah, known as the Hajj, is undertaken by Muslims who are physically and financially able to fulfil the fifth pillar of Islam. Before the advent of air travel, pilgrims performing the Hajj usually travelled by sea to Makkah, where the Ka'bah, the holiest shrine in Islam, is located. From the 1970s, air travel became more popular and due to its proximity to Paya Lebar Airport, Masjid Aminah became a popular stopover for outward-bound pilgrims to perform their subuh (dawn) prayers before proceeding to the airport.

Geylang Serai Market
â€œ[Geylang Serai Market] is still the go-to market for my dad on every other weekend to stock up on groceriesâ€
- Ms Nurul â€˜Izzati Yusof, former resident Block 1 Jalan Pasar Baru

Geylang Serai Market was completed in 1964 as part of the 1962 Redevelopment Plan to modernise Geylang Serai. The market was bounded by Blocks 2 and 3, Jalan Pasar Baru and Taj Cinema. The original market, popularly known as pasar baru, was divided into three sections: the wet market where customers could buy fresh produce, meats and fish; a designated area for cooked food stalls; and an arcade area for clothes, sundry items and shops providing a variety of services.
Geylang Serai Market served the residents of Geylang Serai for more than forty years. It was the social and economic centre of the area. In 2006, as part of an upgrading programme, the original market was demolished and replaced by a newer market that officially opened in 2010. The new Geylang Serai Market comprises two storeys and has an expanded seating area for the cooked food section as well as a more accessible and cleaner wet market section.

Shopping in Geylang Serai
The original Geylang Serai Market was part of a larger commercial complex comprising the ground floor shops of Blocks 1, 2 and 3, as well as markets and shops along Geylang Serai (Road), Geylang and Changi Roads. The former included Kah Wee Restaurant, Tong Sang Goldsmiths and Jewellers, and a nameless coffeeshop known only as â€œLiverpool Squareâ€. The latter included Haji Hashim Enterprise, Toko Wijaya, S Omar Alkhatib, Million Goldsmiths and Jewellers, and the two-storey Lian Tai Mohamadan Restaurant (popularly known as Hawa Restaurant).

School Days
During the 1950s to 1980s, there were a number of schools serving the residents of Geylang Serai. These schools included government vernacular and English-medium schools as well as sekolah kampong (rural schools). 
Modelled after Islamic village schools (pesantren), these sekolah kampong were informal institutions which offered classes in religious instruction and Islamic history. Many Malay/Muslim children remembered attending these â€œreligious lessonsâ€ or â€œQur'an recitation classesâ€ either before or after their formal school hours.

Leisure and Entertainment
â€œâ€¦. They don't really need subtitles. They were appreciating the music, the good looks of the actors and actresses, the scenery [of Bollywood movies].â€
- Maarof Salleh, community leader and former Katong resident

As Geylang Serai developed as a residential suburb, leisure activities expanded to keep pace with the leisure and recreational needs of a growing suburban population. From the early 1930s, cinemas or their open-air counterparts, originally constructed to stage bangsawan performances, began screening â€œtalkiesâ€ (films with sounds).
In addition to cinemas, Geylang Serai residents also patronised Happy World Amusement Park, which opened in 1937, to enjoy its broad range of entertainment options. Happy World was similar to other amusement parks such as New World at Jalan Besar and Great World at River Valley, which emerged during the interwar years and flourished well into the post-war period in Singapore.
After World War II, leisure and entertainment options for Geylang Serai residents continued to grow. During the 1950s, an amusement park was built on the site of the future Geylang Serai Market to bring amusement rides and games nearer to Geylang Serai residents. Old cinemas were refurbished and new cinemas were built. There was also the cheaper option of open-air cinemas located in Joo Chiat and near the kampungs along Jalan Alsagoff.

OUR GEYLANG SERAI: COMMUNITY AND HERITAGE
Our Geylang Serai
Geylang Serai carries both social and personal significance for the members of the local Malay/Muslim community, and their experiences and memories of Geylang Serai have been immortalised in a variety of media including photographs, oral histories, novels, poetry and even popular music. 
At the heart of these experiences and memories are social interactions and community activities, such as coming together, gotong royong style, to prepare for a wedding at a communal space, attending a cultural performance at the former Malay Village, or patronising the bustling Ramadan Bazaar for new attire and seasonal cuisine. 
These shared experiences bring the residents of Geylang Serai together, create lasting memories, establish relationships and foster a sense of belonging. They contribute to Geylang Serai's heritage and strengthen its place in the hearts of the Malay/Muslim community and all Singaporeans.
Weddings and Shared Spaces
The Malay/Muslim wedding is a community experience and festive social occasion where family and friends come together in preparation and in celebration. It usually begins with the nikah, where the groom, accompanied by family and friends, brings gifts to the bride's family where the marriage will be solemnised according to Muslim laws.
The nikah is followed by the majlis bersanding (sitting-in-state ceremony) at the bride's family residence, after which the couple travels with the bride's family and friends to another wedding reception at the groom's family residence, known as bertandang. At both receptions, the newly-wedded couple â€œsit-in-stateâ€ as king and queen for the day
The abovementioned customs and rituals formally present the couple as a new family unit to their families as well as the larger community, and seek to foster extended ties of kinship and friendship. These customs were especially important in the past when the bride and groom hailed from different kampungs in Singapore or from other countries.  
As Geylang Serai evolved from kampungs to high-rise modern living, the Malay/Muslim community adapted to the times, and many would hold their wedding receptions in shared community spaces. As such, wedding receptions were, and are still, held at HDB void decks or the halls of community centres and organisations such as Persekutuan Sepaktakraw Singapura (PERSES) or Singapore Sepaktakraw Federation.

It is customary in many parts of the Malay Archipelago for the bride and groom to be dressed in wedding outfits cut from the same textile. Traditionally, textiles such as ikat were woven by weavers in the village, although batik and songket (handwoven textile) textiles were also traded across the region. The finest songkets are woven with gold or silver-wrapped threads, and could only be afforded by the wealthy or royalty. Hence, they are worn on special occasions such as weddings, when the bride and groom are presented as royalty for the day. At the same time, the choice of textiles also serves as a cultural statement as the wedding outfits often reflect the bride's and groom's ancestral cultural roots.

Ramadan Bazaar and Hari Raya Puasa
Geylang Serai is arguably most well-known for its annual Ramadan Bazaar which started in the 1950s with seasonal traders and itinerant peddlers staking plots along the road to hawk food and goods during the month of Ramadan. Since its early beginnings, the bazaar primarily caters to the needs of Malay/Muslim consumers who buy food to break the ritual fast at sunset and shop for new clothes and wares in preparation for Aidil Fitri, or Hari Raya Puasa.
Occupying the stretch of Geylang Road between Joo Chiat Road and Paya Lebar Road, the bazaar has a festive atmosphere amplified by throngs of customers, shouting of vendors and blasting of seasonal music. The range and affordability of offerings, from traditional Malay dishes and cookies to fashionable outfits in batik, baju Melayu and kebaya, draw customers back to the bazaar every year.

Similar to famous cities such as New York, Paris, London, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, local neighbourhoods such as Tanjong Katong and Geylang have also been immortalised in Malay song and prose. Geylang Serai, in particular, has captured the hearts and imagination of many local writers, poets and musicians, and featured in a range of literary and musical materials which referenced the area's characteristics at different points in its history.
Over the course of almost 200 years, Geylang Serai has undergone a remarkable transformation from an agricultural district to a highly urbanised residential suburb. As part of its transformation journey, the area's physical and social landscapes have also evolved as buildings and landmarks are built, demolished and rebuilt over time.
Despite the numerous changes Geylang Serai has undergone, the community of Geylang Serai remains closely knitted and the charms and spirt of the area are still evident today. With the foundation of the Geylang Serai spirit, as the area develops further, the community of residents, businesses and social institutions that call Geylang Serai home will have more opportunities to foster positive and meaningful interactions with one another.

What makes Singapore, Singapore? And what makes Singapore home? @ Home, Truly follows Nadine, and her Gong Gong (Mandarin for ""grandfather"") as they relive the highs, lows, and moments in between of Singapore's journey from its beginnings as a nation till today.
Each chapter in this digital experience is illustrated by a different artist, in their own inimitable style.
This experience is presented in collaboration with The Straits Times. This is the last chapter of the story, and it explores the question of what home truly is. Read on, or click here to explore other chapters.
We hope you stay a while, and make yourself at home, truly!
There and Back Again
Hope, Truly
There and Back Again
Hello, welcome back to the story of Nadine and Gong Gong. It's been more than a year since they spent time together during the circuit breaker period. This time, it's Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) for the second time.
â€œGong Gong, do you feel like it's a repeat of what happened last year?â€ â€œHmmâ€¦ Only a little. This time, I only see you at dinner.â€
This chapter's illustrations are by YT Tommy Lee, a local illustrator who creates visuals that carry a sense of quiet contemplation and explore what it means to be human, through the emotive use of colours and space.
â€œGong Gong, remember you told me so many stories last year? I really liked hearing about how you met Po Po on that rainy National Day. I wish I had met her.â€
â€œI wish she got to meet you, too. She would have loved going to parks with you! She really liked to be surrounded by nature â€“ the sounds of birds, the smell of rainâ€¦â€
â€œDo you miss Po Po?â€
â€œOh, of course, sweetheart. Every day.â€
â€œMum has never told meâ€¦ How did Po Po die? I've wondered about it, but never dared to ask.â€
â€œWellâ€¦ It's never easy to talk about these things. But I'm here for you, and will always do my best to answer your questions. Po Po died very suddenly, just after your mum and Appa got married. She suddenly collapsed one day, and passed away four days later. Till today, I'm not very sure what exactly caused it. There was bleeding in the brain.
Sometimes I don't understand why these things happen. I wish she were here to grow old with me. I wish she were here to see you grow up. But life doesn't always turn out the way we hope it wouldâ€¦â€
â€œGong Gong, you're making me cry!â€
â€œAww, Nadineâ€¦ You look just like Po Po when she cried! She hated crying! I suppose nobody likes it.â€
â€œYou mean you made Po Po cry?! Gong Gong!â€
Gong Gong laughs. â€œHuman beings tend to do that. They make other people cry sometimes. But they also make each other smile and laugh, and a whole lot else too. I always tried hard not to make her cry, though. And she did the same for me.â€
How do you carry on, Gong Gong? If you died I would be so, so sad.â€
â€œNadine, one day, I will die. You will be very sad, it's true. But all the things we've done together, and the things we share, no one can ever take that away from you. I can't tell you what will keep you goingâ€¦ It's a little bit of everything. It's being with the people you love. It's exploring new parks. It's singing a new favourite song, and sometimes an old favourite song. And it's a little bit each day. But that's the beauty of it, it's for you to find out, little by little.â€
â€œGong Gong, that's so mysterious and doesn't answer my question at all!!!â€
â€œBut Nadine, it's the unexpected that makes life so beautiful sometimes. I was surprised by your question about Po Po, and even though it makes us both a little sad, it was good for us to talk about it.â€
â€œI want to write a story about Po Po next time, so I can learn more about her and be more like her.â€
â€œSure, we can start nowâ€¦!â€
Hope, Truly
Dear Reader,
The last more-than-a-few months have been difficult for so many, and in so many different ways. We won't list the different ways â€“ because these words won't do justice to what you've been through â€“ but we just want to say that we feel with you, whoever and wherever you are.
Just like Nadine, we've been discovering that home is more than a place. It's the people we love. Their stories nourish us. Their words give us hope. Sometimes, these people are not even close to us. Sometimes, all that connects us is that we're human beings.
If you have a story to share, tell it to someone today. If someone wants to tell you a story, take the time to listen. May we all be home to each other in times like these (and times like always).
Thank you for being a part of this story. (And do click on the friendly Chatbird if you'd like to leave a message or share your feedback.)
Yours hopefully,

Previously a common ingredient in Chinese households, the salted fish is most associated with Cantonese cuisine today. This preserved ingredient - with a pungent smell - has found itself at odds with contemporary palates over the last century in Singapore.
By Wong Pui Lam Lydia (NTU History Programme)

Salted fish is, as its name implies, fish that has been salted. This simple process utilises a single ingredient â€“ salt to preserve fish as it extracts water out of the fish and also prevents the growth of microbes. Salted fish is consumed in different traditional cuisines around the world, especially in places close to the seas and oceans. In Chinese cuisine (both that of maritime Southeast Asia and China), the use of salted fish is most associated with Cantonese cuisine due to the large number of dishes that use the ingredient. It is traditionally consumed not only because of its long shelf life but also, more importantly, for the distinctive flavours that it brings. Just like soy sauce (liquid condiment made from fermented soy beans), bean sauce (fermented bean paste made from soy beans), fish sauce (liquid condiment made from fermented fish) and salted vegetables (fermented and brined vegetables), the ingredient makes a dish savoury and imparts a unique, deeper taste not found in plain salt or in any of the above mentioned ingredients.

The salted fish used in Cantonese cuisines is not necessarily restricted to a particular species or type of fish. Fishermen, whether deep-sea fishers or those operating in the intertidal zones closer to shore, had traditionally salted the fishes they caught to preserve them, minimising losses from spoilage. Besides the variety of fish species, there are also varieties to the method of drying and the resultant product. In most cuisines around the world, the salted fish commonly used is that with a hard flesh (a result of the drying process the fish undergoes). For the salted fish used in Cantonese cuisine, it is separated into two types: sat yoke (å¯¦è‚‰) and muiheung (éœ‰é¦™/æ¢…é¦™). Sat yoke means hard flesh and is similar to most salted fish found in other traditional cuisines. For the muiheung (éœ‰é¦™) variety, mui (éœ‰) means mold and heung (é¦™) stands for fragrance, which provide clues to how the muiheung salted fish is prepared and the reasons for its popularity. While any fish can be made into the muiheung salted fish, the Spanish mackerel (ma kao yu, é©¬äº¤é±¼) and threadfin (ma you yu, é©¬æ²¹é±¼) are preferred due to its high fat content, fleshy meat and bigger bones which allows for easier deboning. To prepare a muiheung salted fish, one has to ferment the fish â€“ the process known in Cantonese as faat mui (å‘éœ‰) or faat gau (å‘é…µ) â€“ for a number of days before commencing salting and drying. The additional fermentation of the fish results in a crumbly paste-like texture and a unique scent. Those accustomed to the smell describe it as â€œfragrantâ€, while others can be put off by it.

Singapore has long been an important regional entrepÃ´t and centre for the salted fish trade. Its supply of salted fish came from different places like Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong and parts of South China. The Nanyang Siang Pau in pre-war Singapore reports on salted fish supplies and prices regularly, in full page spreads, alongside essential food items like eggs, oil and rice, and precious metals like gold. The price of Chinese salted fish was reported to be sold at a cheaper price in Singapore than in some places of production like Malaysia. Today, most of the salted fish sold in Singapore's dried good stores or supermarkets are from Malaysia and Indonesia.
Headline of an article â€œSanitary Board forces salted fish traders at Lau Pa Sat to shut down their businesses due to sanitary threats to public servants caused by foul smell. Sellers are given 7 days to remove salted fishâ€ published in Nanyang Siang Pau on 7 March 1934 (Source: Nanyang Siang Pau Â© Singapore Press Holdings Limited)
Over the last century, the consumption of salted fish has often been discouraged and viewed negatively. In colonial Singapore, the Sanitary Board banned the sale of Chinese salted fish at Lau Pa Sat on one notable occasion in 1934. The foul smell was perceived to be a threat to the area's hygiene and also to the health of government officials working there. The issue was eventually resolved through intervention of the General Chinese Trade Affairs Association (present-day Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry) with the complete removal of the item from the affected dried seafood retailers. This episode, however, did little to reduce the viability and consumption of salted fish among the Chinese in pre-war Singapore.
Up till the 1970s, salted fish continued to be a common food item as it was cheap and alongside with salty ingredients like preserved vegetables, its salty taste was thought to help people consume more rice which filled their stomachs more. In emerging discussions around nutritional health in the Nanyang Siang Pau in the late 1960s, salted fish along with preserved sausages were described as vital sources of protein in an otherwise carbohydrate heavy diet. However, reports in the 70s began surfacing on the possible link between nasopharyngeal cancer and salted fish which then gradually affected the demand for the commodity. By the 1990s, salted fish had come to be perceived as being synonymous with cancer and its consumption discouraged. With reduced sodium intake for health reasons and increased disposable incomes increasing the affordability of fresh fish, the consumption of salted fish has declined continually over the years. One wonders what the future holds for this historically important food item. Will there be a revival in its culinary use or consumption? Or would it become a relic of the culinary and food history?

Every now and then, I will crave for the delectable and fragrant scent of the salted fish. Chef Huang Shea Neung who serves Cantonese cuisine at Song Garden, Mercure Hotel, kindly prepared a feast that featured salted fish in every dish served. Chefs in zau laus (é…’æ¥¼) â€“ high-end Chinese restaurants, pride themselves in being able to cook special dishes requested by the customers, as long as the ingredients are available. The dishes served were claypot rice with preserved sausage, chicken and salted fish, fried rice with salted fish, stewed tofu with minced meat and salted fish, mini char siew buns with salted fish and lastly, mini chicken pies with salted fish. The first three dishes were not on the menu and the latter two mini-bite pastries were unique creations that Chef Huang prepared for this occasion. Ingredients like salted fish and dishes cooked with claypots would not have been served in zau laus as they were considered unpresentable in these places associated with fine dining. Salted fish dishes that we see in zau laus today are due to more people (with higher disposable incomes as the economy improved) dining there and requesting for dishes commonly cooked and consumed at home. It is this new demand that perhaps provides the greatest hope for the survival and future of this delicacy.

Many traditional bakeries which we frequent have been around for generations, but how much do we know about them? This photo essay showcases how traditional bakeries maintain and/or grow their businesses through adaptation to changing technologies, opportunities and tastes in Singapore society.
By Jasmine Woo and Grace Ann (NTU History Programme)
In an era of globalisation and westernisation, bakeries selling traditional pastries have continued to hold their ground in Singapore. This photo essay offers a glimpse into Balmoral Bakery, Traditional Haig Road Putu Piring and Bangalore Iyengar's Bakery. Each section will share the history and influences of each bakery and feature specific food items. These bakeries showcase how traditions have been preserved or adapted through vicissitudes of time, helping us trace the rich heritage of Singapore's food culture.

Western bakeries catering to Asian customers have been around since the late colonial period. One of the pioneers of English-style bakes in Singapore, Balmoral Bakery was founded by Hainanese bakers in 1965. The items on their menu have familiar British pastries such as beef pies, buttercream cakes, rum balls and more. They also incorporated local flavours into some of these pastries. For instance, in their buttercream cakes, they introduced flavours like kaya pandan. Their most popular item is the egg tart â€“ which in its abundant creamy-filling could be an influence British egg custard tarts. Unlike usual egg tarts, Balmoral Bakery has improvised the crust of Balmoral Bakery's egg tarts to be taller, becoming the bakery's unique identity.
Balmoral Bakery was first set up along a stretch of British restaurants and pubs in Holland Village. When the government reclaimed the shophouse area, the bakery moved to a new location at Sunset Way in 1984. Yet, the bakery is still frequented by people who still reside in the former location. A man in his 60s shared that although he resides in Holland Village, he still patronises the store in Sunset Way every week.
Starting out as a family business, the bakery has no intentions of expanding. Their menu items have remained the same over the years, and the head baker, Lim Ming Noong, has insisted that prices remain low so that any customer can enjoy.

Traditional Haig Road Putu Piring is a Muslim owned bakery that has been passed down generations. Starting out as a family-run business, its history dates back to the 1930s. It started as a food cart along Lorong 1 Jalan Besar, then along Sungei Road before moving into a physical store at Bukit Batok in 1985. In 1994, the store shifted to a Kopitiam at Block 12 Haig Road where it still remains today. Despite selling a variety of pastries like pineapple tarts and butter cookies, the bakery's speciality is Putu Piring. Putu Piring, a popular Malay snack, is a round-shaped, traditional steamed rice flour cake filled with gula melaka or palm sugar. 
At Traditional Haig Road Putu Piring, they use gula melaka imported from Java. While the bakery is still headed by the same family, the business now has five different outlets in Singapore. At the Haig Road outlet, both family and staff still believe in preserving the traditional recipe of Putu Piring that is filled with gula melaka. However, to adapt to changing tastes and preferences, you can find many different flavours that will suit a variety of taste buds including durian, chocolate and brown coconut in other stores. The business has also opened its newer outlets in air-conditioned environments. While these changes are necessary for the business to keep up with the times, the gula melaka putu piring still stands as the best-seller.

Bangalore Iyengar was first opened by Mr Saran's father in 2012, with Mr Saran taking over the family business as its current owner. Named Bangalore, the pastries are prepared following authentic recipes from Bangalore, India. However, they also incorporate the flavours of India as a whole. Among their baked pastries, Bangalore Iyengar is best known for their puffs and pastries like Samosa. With a variety of flavours for filing, Mr Saran promises that the taste of their puffs are unique and can't be found elsewhere in Singapore. Apart from the usual bread and cakes, other favourites include handmade biscuits bundled in transparent packagings like Butter Mukukku, Ola Pakoda, Lakdi Biscuits and Kara Boondi.
To integrate the taste of Indian pastries to the preference of Singaporeans, Mr Saran and his father had to be aware of Singapore's multi-ethnic culture. When deciding on aspects of the business to improve, the family actively responded to the feedback of their customers. The decision of providing coffee or tea so customers can enjoy a more wholesome meal was based on customer feedback. The friendly staff also labels the pastries and explain them to customers who may be unfamiliar with the names of Indian pastries. By adapting to the changes and expectations of the industry, they have managed to grow the bakery and successfully opened a restaurant.
Over the years, different bakeries have taken varying approaches to preserve Singapore's food culture. Balmoral Bakery, Traditional Haig Road Putu Piring and Bangalore Iyengar embody the spirit of preserving the old while moving forward with the times. More than anything, these traditional bakeries have provided us a humble glimpse into Singapore's food identities and heritage. With these bakeries trying the best to uphold the traditional food cultures, it would be great if the younger generation would give these nostalgic treats a chance, allowing the continuation of traditional food culture. Pastries and cakes (both Western and Asian) have been a huge part of Singapore's food identities and heritage and we hope everyone will continue to support these bakeries!

Indian Muslim hawker stalls are commonplace in Singapore. Their innovative dishes are a staple, but what does it take to produce consistent and quality food day in and day out under sweltry conditions? At Tekka Centre, which has the record highest number of Indian Muslims stalls under one roof, the guardians of Indian Muslim food heritage share their daily experiences.
By Fanzura Banu (NTU History Programme)
What is considered authentic Indian Muslim food? Sometimes, I get this question from friends while eating at an Indian Muslim restaurant. This question is a tough one to crack as these restaurants might serve a wide range of South Indian vegetarian food items such as Idly and Thosai or even Thai cuisine and Western food to cater to a wide audience. To find authentic establishments that specialise solely on Indian Muslim food, one can head to the nearest hawker centre. There, we will be able to see our local Indian Muslim cuisine, which was born on the streets of Singapore and Malaysia.
To me, two distinct features of Indian Muslim hawker culture are fusion and innovation. For instance, dishes like Soup Tulang Merah were invented to reduce wastage of mutton bones at the end of the day, after the mutton is used for Mee Kuah and Mee Goreng. The element of innovation is evident even in the names of the food and drinks, ranging from Roti John to Milo Dinosaur. These relatively newer additions are often sold alongside iconic classics originating from India or Persia such as Biryani and Murtabak, to name a few.

An under-explored facet to Indian Muslim hawker culture and its dishes â€” which have been sold for generations â€” is the story of labour and perseverance. To capture Indian Muslim hawker lifestyle in its element, I headed to Tekka Centre early one Tuesday morning. Previously known as Zhujiao Centre, Tekka now includes a wet market on the first floor and retail space for Indian clothes on the second floor. It was renamed in 2000 to honour the multi-ethnic history of the area â€” responding to the colloquial name â€œTeh Kah Kiahâ€ (foot of the small bamboos) the market had amongst the Hokkien community. Prior to recent renovations, 31 out of 33 Indian hawker stalls were serving Indian Muslim cuisine or Indian-Muslim owned.
To my surprise, 9 am was not nearly early enough to catch these hawkers setting up their stalls. â€œI start at 4 amâ€, shared Mr Hamzah, 63, of Royal Dum Biryani (#01-252)*, who typically starts at dawn to ensure that the food is flavourful and ready by 10.30am. Two interesting points I learnt while enquiring about Dum Biryani is that â€˜dum' refers to slow cooking with sealed lid to allow the meat and layered rice to be infused with its own spices and aroma. Secondly, the main chef within Indian Muslim stalls is called â€˜Bhandari', which has several meanings, among which include â€˜caterer' in Hindi or â€˜ship cook' in Tamil.

â€œDo your duty, don't fret over the result.â€
Next, I headed to Haji Johan Indian Muslim Food/Temasek Indian Rojak (#01-254), which is run by Ms Zarina. She too shared that before moving closer to her stall at Tekka Centre, she used to start preparation as early as 2am, similar to Mr Hamzah. As a single mother in the late 1980s, she turned to the food business as a source of income to support her sons. Since 1996, she has had her own stall and continues to enjoy cooking with the help of her trusted employee and her children. â€œI used to sell Thosai in the morning and used the profit to buy the ingredients for the lunch menu in the afternoon. I don't know anything else but workâ€. When I asked how she keeps motivated, she smiled and said a Tamil proverb, â€œKadameiyei sei, palanai yedhirpaakadheyâ€ â€” do your duty, don't fret over the result.  
On friendships, Ms Zarina and other stall owners shook their head with a sad smile. â€œThere is no time to interact with other vendors. But there is an understanding. If you need to go somewhere urgently, the neighbouring stall-owners will be willing to keep an eye out for youâ€ she said. Competition too, is said to be minimal since each stall has its own set of loyal customers.

Other than the chefs, the cashiers and helpers also play a crucial part within the microcosm of a hawker stall. Often, employees prefer to stay in the same stall for decades for the sake of familiarity and comfort. Friendships are forged within the tiny space of the hawker store and the culinary expertise is passed down to children who show interest. It is also not uncommon for employees to set up their own hawker stall once learning the trade. Mr Majharudeen of Zham Zham Muslim food (#01-217), who has been working at Tekka since 1978, said that the most memorable day for him was during Circuit Breaker, when his Bhandari had to cook Biryani 8 times in a single day without break, with the â€˜takeaways only' rule eliminating the usual lull periods between lunch and dinner crowds. Some locals were also ordering takeaways in bulk for donation to migrant workers.
Like in Tekka Centre, Indian Muslim hawkers who have been working round the clock for generations can be found all over Singapore. Next time you visit West Coast Food Centre or ABC Brickworks, keep a look out for these stalls and the people who are keeping Indian Muslim food heritage alive.

Ang Ku Kueh, which translates to â€œRed Tortoise Cakeâ€, is a small oval-shaped Chinese treat that traces its history from Southern Fujian, China before making its way to Southeast Asia. Although Ang Ku Kueh remains popular today, its significance in Chinese religious and cultural traditions is often overlooked.
By Cao Mingmin (NTU History Programme)
Ang Ku Kueh, which translates to â€œRed Tortoise Cakeâ€ in Hokkien, is a small oval-shaped Chinese treat consisting of a soft, sticky glutinous rice flour skin wrapped with a filling that is usually sweet. Its distinctive design that resembles a tortoise shell sets it apart from other treats. The kueh traces its history from southern Fujian, China â€“ in Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, before making its way along migration routes across maritime Southeast Asia. Although Ang Ku Kueh remains popular today as a tea-time snack, its significance in Chinese religious and cultural traditions is often overlooked.
The making of Ang Ku Kueh starts from grinding and mixing the fillings. After that, strips of peanut fillings are divided equally to be wrapped in dough skin.

Ensuring consistency throughout the process, including the separation of dough despite it being done by hand, is essential to making good Ang Ku Kueh.

In ancient China, tortoises were believed to be used as sacrifices to Chinese deities in seeking good fortune and longevity. However, as live tortoises were not easily sourced, turtle-shaped offerings were gradually developed as alternatives. As the name suggests, Ang Ku Kuehs are traditionally red in colour and have a chewy texture when eaten. In Chinese culture, the colour red here symbolises joy and happiness, while the tortoise shape signifies longevity, auspiciousness, wealth, and completeness.
After grinding and dividing the fillings, the Ang Ku Kueh is moulded by hand.

Lastly, finely moulded Ang Ku Kueh will be steamed for approximately five minutes.

From then on, Ang Ku Kuehs became an important kueh for offering on many occasions such as Chinese New Year, birthday of the Jade Emperor and in the celebrations of many other Chinese deities. By offering Ang Ku Kueh on ritual altars, devotees hope that the sweetness of the kueh will sweeten the mouths of the deities so that they will speak positively about the devotee in front of the Jade Emperor. During these religious festivals, Ang Ku Kuehs are usually bought in sets of 12 as it is considered auspicious. Another specially shaped Ang Ku Kueh that is offered on altar tables is the Money Kueh (é’±ç³•), which is moulded from a design that depicts a string of copper coins.
According to Kelvin Toh, the second-generation owner of Ji Xiang Confectionery, the different coloured kuehs indicate the different kinds of fillings. In the 1980s, Ji Xiang expanded its assortment of fillings as tastes diversified. Although there were many colours to choose from, red-coloured Ang Ku Kuehs of mung bean fillings are the traditional option in preparing for these occasions. In a year, the three busiest periods for Ji Xiang are the Jade Emperor's birthday, Qing Ming Festival week, and the Hungry Ghost Festival month. On these important dates, only red-coloured Ang Ku Kuehs are made to speed up the process and meet demands.

In addition to being religious offerings, Ang Ku Kuehs are also used in commemorating a newborn's first month or the birthdays of elders. Eating the kueh and distributing them to relatives and friends during these occasions represent blessings for the child and longevity for the elder in the family. A notable social practice that has recently gained in popularity is stepping on a pair of big-sized , known as â€˜Ka Ta Kueh' (è…³è¸ç²¿), traditionally seen when a baby turns one year old. The stepping on the Ka Ta Kueh, followed by stepping into a new pair of shoes symbolises a smooth journey in life, and the parents' wishes that the child will be down-to-earth in his or her future endeavors. As Kelvin recalled, the practice became more popular in 2015 after a video made in commemoration of SG50 included scenes of â€œstepping on the Ka Ta Kuehâ€. Before 2015, Ka Ta Kuehs were only made a few times in a year. Now, Ji Xiang sells 20-30 pairs a week.
Wooden moulds for Money Kueh and Ka Ta Kueh are less common in the market today. Without these moulds, the traditions and practices that depended on such equipment may soon disappear.
2021, Photographs taken by Cao Mingmin and Soe Wai Yan Linn.

The resurgence of this practice reflects how some traditions are still relevant and important within the Chinese community today. Stepping on the Ka Ta Kueh represents the enduring desire of parents to give their children a smooth start to life. Heritage businesses like Ji Xiang play an important role in keeping such social practices practicable. The significance of food heritage businesses lies not only in the food it sells, but also in its role of supporting our social practices and transmitting them to future generations. Greater awareness and understanding of these practices can therefore allow us to better appreciate our Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) that has since shaped our cultural and communal identity.

Commonly served during Javanese family events, Nasi Ambeng has become an important dish in Javanese food culture and identity in Singapore. Overtime, this dish has weaved its way into becoming a visible and prominent dish in the wider Malay food cuisine in Singapore.
By Syafiq Moklas (NTU History Programme)
Commonly served during Javanese family events, Nasi Ambeng has become an important dish in Javanese food culture and identity in Singapore. Over time, this dish has weaved its way into becoming a visible and prominent dish in the wider Malay food cuisine in Singapore.
Nasi Ambeng often consist of juicy beef/chicken rendang (slow cooked meat), aromatic sambal goreng (fried chilli paste cooked with fermented soybeans and long beans), crispy tempe goreng (fried fermented soybeans), crunchy mix of urap (salad with coconut dressing) and serunding (sautÃ©ed grated coconut), accompanied by a large portion of fragrant white rice. It is the combination of these ingredients which epitomises the delicacy, exquisiteness, and the goodness of Javanese food into one large sharing platter. The actual combination of ingredients differs from place to place. It is the spirit of communal eating that forms the core of Nasi Ambeng.
While other Javanese dishes such as Nasi Tumpeng ties in spiritual significance with the food, Nasi Ambeng is more often seen as a dish for everyone, for every occasion. Singaporeans of Javanese descent fondly remember having Nasi Ambeng during every majlis (â€˜occasions' in Malay). For 97 years-old Sa'adiah binte Haji Hamzah, she vividly recalls how Nasi Ambeng was served for most communal occasions during her stay at Kampong Java.
â€œFrom majlis doa kesyukuran (thanksgiving prayer ceremony) to slamaten (Javanese communal feast), Nasi Ambeng would be served to guests after wrapping up the prayer sessions during these events.â€
Yet, the Nasi Ambeng platter was never meant to be eaten completely. Instead, guests eating from the platter will leave some food to be shared among themselves and brought home for their respective families. This tradition is also known as Nasi Berkat (food blessed by host to be brought home) and was a common practice at most Javanese events. It was only in the late 1970s that the commercialization of Nasi Ambeng began, with the dish being introduced to restaurants and eateries. Madam Azizah Ali, who founded Azizah's Restaurant, located along Emerald Hill, was one of the pioneers in serving Nasi Ambeng commercially. It quickly grew to become one of the most popular dishes in her restaurant.
Padi@Bussorah's co-owners (from left) Salman Abdullah, Normala Sah, Hashim Ali and Adam Malikh Zainul. The eatery sells up to 600 Nasi Ambeng platters a month, 2015. Image credit: Kenneth Goh.
Today, Nasi Ambeng is often served in many Malay restaurants and eateries. Perhaps, this is a prime example of the amalgamation of 2 identities â€“ both Malay and Javanese. With more sub-ethnic Malay groups (such as Javanese, Boyanese and Bugis) identifying oneself as being â€˜Malay,' it is interesting on how they have infused parts of their own culture into the Malay culture; food being one of them!
The shifting identities of the Javanese and Malay communities inevitably saw the absorption and adaptation of Nasi Ambeng into Malay food cuisine. One example would be Padi @ Bussorah. While they present themselves as specialists in Malay cuisine, Padi @ Bussorah has included Nasi Ambeng into their menu. Not only does this widen their selection of Malay cuisines, it also solidifies Nasi Padang's acceptance as being part of the wider Malay cuisines.
To further illustrate Nasi Ambeng's position within the Malay community, we take a look at a humble eatery that serves Nasi Ambeng as part of their main set meals. Currently situated at 182 Woodlands Street 13, its owner, Madam Rosliah (a lady of Boyanese-descent), has incorporated Nasi Ambeng into its menu- since the mid-1990s- as she saw an increasing demand among her customers. Having already served Nasi Padang, the addition of Nasi Ambeng reinforced the diverse array of food traditions on offer at the restaurant, highlighting the cultural diversity encapsulated within Malay food.

It is evident that Nasi Ambeng has become popular among many within the Malay community and has become an important staple dish in the evolving Malay cuisine of Singapore. Additional dishes have begun to be included into Nasi Ambeng, creating more variety and vibrancy to the meal. Also, eateries and restaurants are starting to serve Nasi Ambeng as an individual plate, instead of the usual sharing platter. This demonstrates the adaptability of the Nasi Ambeng dish as it began to cater to a new audience and market.
Speaking of new audiences and markets, Nasi Ambeng saw itself to be the centre of a debate with Violet Oon's rendition of the â€˜Nyonya Nasi Ambeng Tray,' later renamed to â€˜Family Trays.' While members of the Javanese Singaporean community expressed concerns over the possibility of misappropriating their culture, it can also be viewed as an example of how Nasi Ambeng's popularity has transcended cultural borders. The fluidity of culture proves to be its remarkable element, yet, it is also undoubtedly important to understand the value and meaning of the Nasi Ambeng dish within the Javanese community.

Finally, we examine Warong Anak Wedok (â€œFemale's Stallâ€ in Javanese), ran by two sisters, Madam Sulami Margimin and Madam Suriati Margimin (both of Javanese-descents). Unlike the previous eateries, Warong Anak Wedok aims to not only serve authentic Javanese cuisines but also to introduce Singaporeans to new and interesting Javanese dishes. Since its inception in early 2018, Warong Anak Wedok has served a variety of Javanese dishes to their customers such as Ayam Lemak Pecel (Chicken cooked in Pecel Coconut Milk). Needless to say, Nasi Ambeng places itself as one of their top sellers!

Previously situated in Fragrance Empire Building, Warong Anak Wedok catered to the needs of its customer by serving Nasi Ambeng in an individual plate, instead of its usual sharing platter. This move demonstrates how culture can still be appreciated in respect with the changing of setting.
As Warong Anak Wedok is gearing up to re-open their business in a new location, they are also keen to introduce a new rendition of Nasi Ambeng. Known as Nasi Remes (mixed rice), this dish consists of Nasi Liwet's (Javanese spiced anchovies rice) and Nasi Ambeng's dishes. While Nasi Ambeng was originally served as a sharing platter, Nasi Remes is served individually. This interesting development shows how Nasi Ambeng is being continually modified and served in new ways, even within Javanese cuisine.
â€œWe want to showcase the fluidity of Javanese cuisines, particularly Nasi Ambeng.â€
Amidst the commercialisation of Nasi Ambeng, it is often forgotten that the essence of Nasi Ambeng is to bring family members and friends together. Sharing a meal on the same platter binds people in a very different manner from a group eating from separate plates. For 67 years-old Moklas bin Ma'arof, Nasi Ambeng (on a platter) has been a norm since his younger days and his family would try their best to have it together on special occasions such as birthdays or at get-together sessions.
â€œNothing beats seating together around a tray of delicious food, shared among my loved ones.â€
Undoubtedly, Nasi Ambeng has maintained its significance and position in the hearts of the Javanese community, although it has been absorbed into wider Malay cuisine and also been transformed through processes of culinary innovation and cross-cultural fusion. Understanding its past and its evolution highlights the fluidity of culture - in this case, food culture. Importantly, it provides us a better understanding of Nasi Ambeng within the Javanese community.

Hello! Welcome back to Nadine and Gong Gong's story. It's the May holidays, and Nadine is staying at her Gong Gong's home while her parents work at the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis. In our last chapter, Nadine was inspired by Gong Gong's stories about old toys, and decided to make something.
Of course, Gong Gong is all too happy to help. This â€œprojectâ€ reminds him of when he was a young boy, and his sisters would make paper dolls. He had helped them to make a paper dog, once.
Psst! This chapter's illustrations are by Isaac Liang, who was born deaf and began his artistic journey at four when he started drawing on the cupboards of his home with crayons. Through his illustrations, animations, and traditional art mediums, Isaac amplifies vision and tells visual stories in a unique way.

Paper dolls were all the rage in the first half of the 20th century, appearing in magazines, newspapers and comic books. This paper doll set has magnets on the individual pieces for children to play â€œdress upâ€ with their dolls. This set even features a doll holding a doll... or perhaps a baby being carried rather precariously!
This Fashion
It is evening. Nadine and Gong Gong have spent all afternoon making a paper doll of Nadine and a wardrobe with different clothes, and tiny, twisty paper-clip hangers to go along with them. Nadine tells Gong Gong she's happy she didn't just quit and throw everything away.
  â€œThis pinafore is my school uniform! The most magical part is the belt. It can be folded into different shapes. Sometimes when I eat a lot for recess, I feel very full and take it off at my desk!â€
â€œThis cheongsam represents my mummy's familyâ€¦ and it is pink! When I was a kid, I liked this colour a lot.â€
â€œThe Punjabi suit represents my Appa's side (of the family). For both Chinese New Year and Deepavali, we buy new clothes!â€
For many of the festive occasions in Singapore, people buy new clothes for several reasons â€“ to celebrate a fresh start, to set the tone for the new year, to welcome luck and prosperity, to enjoy being in matching outfits with the whole familyâ€¦ or just for fun!

This family is all dressed up in new clothes to celebrate Deepavali. Two of the ladies are wearing sari, a long piece of fabric draped across the body, over a short, fitted blouse (choli) and a long petticoat. The sari has traditionally been regarded as a sign of maturity, or coming of age â€“ which may explain why the younger girls are not wearing it but are nonetheless garbed in striking colours and fine materials.
Cheongsam that belonged to Singapore's war-time heroine, Elizabeth Choy (1953, Silk, Gift of Elizabeth Choy. Collection of National Museum of Singapore.)
This silk cheongsam with floral prints was worn by the late Mrs Elizabeth Choy at the coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1953 in England. Mrs Choy was an inspiration not only as a war-time heroine who survived close to 200 days of torture, but also as an educator and social worker. She was fond of wearing cheongsam and bangles. The cheongsam (also known as qipao) was popularised in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s. Today, it is often worn during special occasions such as weddings and Chinese New Year.

This lady is wearing a baju kurung (literally â€œdress that enclosesâ€) â€“ a loose-fitting, full-length dress. It is usually worn on top of a sarong (skirt; when worn by women) or a pair of trousers (worn by men). The baju kurung pictured here was made of silk, and most probably used for formal occasions. Baju kurung can also be worn in less formal situations â€“ those for everyday use are likely to be made of more breathable material like cotton.

Family members dressed in matching traditional clothing are a familiar sight across Singapore during Hari Raya Puasa.
â€¦We [would] always get clothes for the children. That is the tradition, where they say Hari Raya you must have new clothes. So the kids also get excited. We will buy clothes for them, shoes and all that. Sounds so silly when you think about it.
- Khatijun Nissa Siraj, in an oral history recording by the National Archives of Singapore
The Lights of Deepavali
â€œDeepavali is one of my favourite festivals! I love going to visit Paati (Tamil for paternal grandmother) and Thatha (Tamil for paternal grandfather), and eating all the sweet treats!â€
Gong Gong smiles as he remembers the first time he met Nadine's other grandparents â€“ after Nadine's mum and dad started dating! It was over Deepavali, and they had gone without their children, and as they arrived at their future in-laws' doorstep, they were not sure if it had been such a good idea to go aloneâ€¦
They needn't have worried, though. Their home was not just filled with lights, but also with light-heartedness, and warmth. Nadine's future Paati and Thatha were hilarious and charming, and Gong Gong and Po Po took to them immediately, despite their apparent differences.
Oil Lamp (Brass. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
Deepavali (from Sanskrit, meaning â€œrow of lightsâ€) is celebrated on Amavasya (â€œno moon nightâ€) and the lighting of lamps signifies the triumph of good over evil, and of knowledge over ignorance. This lamp would have been lit along with several others, to bring brightness on the darkest night.
In-kueh-dible!
Nadine's eyes shine as she thinks about Deepavali. She loves eating murukku (a twisty, savoury snack made from flour), but even more than that, she loves making it with her aunts and cousins â€“ from the shopping for ingredients, to the actual cooking!
Gong Gong has stories to share too â€“ he prepared snacks with Po Po for Chinese New Year (usually not a couple activity, but somehow Gong Gong enjoyed it!). For a few years in the 1990s, they exchanged treats with their Malay neighbours who were celebrating Hari Raya Puasa at the same time. Some of the goodies they shared were even the same, like pineapple tarts and kueh bangkit (melt-in-your-mouth tapioca cookies)!
Photograph of Chinese New Year (second day) and Hari Raya Puasa celebrations at the Botanic Gardens (3 Feb 1965. Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection. Courtesy of the National Archives of Singapore.)
This photograph was taken in 1965, when Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Puasa celebrations coincided. The conjunction of both celebrations occurs once every 33 years â€“ as Hari Raya Puasa is fixed in the Islamic calendar, but moves through the Gregorian calendar (which is the calendar we generally use for business and many other parts of life today).
In Singapore and Malaysia, this meeting of celebratory days has been called â€œKongsi Rayaâ€ (or â€œGongxi Rayaâ€) â€“ where â€œKongsiâ€ means â€œshareâ€ in Malay, and also sounds like â€œGongxiâ€ (literally â€œcongratulationsâ€ in Mandarin â€“ â€œGong Xi Gong Xiâ€ is a Chinese New Year song). From 1996 to 1998, Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year fell on the same week. The two special occasions will only be celebrated in the same week again in 2029.

Hello, welcome (back) to tea-time with Nadine and Gong Gong! Nadine cannot wrap her head around the fact that her mum was once a young girl, and she feels like she's getting to know a new friend, through Gong Gong's stories.
Gong Gong tells Nadine about the time her mum was sooooooo intrigued by the â€œDo Not Openâ€ sign on the door that she almost did something quite dangerous!
That day, Gong Gong was the one who opened a door instead â€“ the door to his daughter's mind, by talking to her!
Psst! This chapter's illustrations are by Xinnie Ng, an illustrative designer who runs X Spots the Mark. Her illustrations are fuelled by the love of creative exploration, inspired by moments of spontaneity and deep ponderings, and they often invite you in for a closer look. (See what you find here, too!)
Speaking of buses, this is an old 45-cent Singapore Bus Service (SBS) ticket. How do you think it was used? Passengers used to board the buses and find a seat first, before a bus conductor would come by to sell them a ticket. The conductor would then punch a hole in their ticket (with a ticket puncher that looks something like the one you see here!) â€“ this circle indicated the number of the bus stop where the passenger boarded.

Clean Streams
Of course, Nadine wants to know what her mum and grandpa used to talk about! The conversation flows right to the Singapore River and its historic clean-up.
The Singapore River, before its big clean-up, is charmingly depicted in several artworks. In this 1958 oil painting by Georgette Chen, the river is bursting with boats bumped up against each other â€“ and yet, there is a calmness and clarity reflected in the water.
Singapore Waterfront (1958, Oil on canvas, Georgette Chen. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
This acrylic painting by Ang Ah Tee covers the same subject â€“ boats crowding the river, against the backdrop of shophouses along Boat Quay. It's interesting to note, though, that this work was painted several years after the river had been cleaned up, with the mass of boats long gone from the scene.

The Singapore River was then really smelly â€“ you could smell it before you saw it. The residents by the river threw everything into the water.

There were all sorts of businesses dumping their waste into the river â€“ sago factories, seaweed factories, street hawkersâ€¦ different waste materials were added into the mix â€“ including human biological waste.
On the image below, Mr Hor also explains,
In the latter part of the 1960s, the labourers by the Singapore River were replaced with these machines. Most of the goods imported via the Singapore River were produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, mostly rice and dried goods.

The Singapore River Clean-Up took 10 years of work â€“ and 10 gold medals. Well, sort of. While efforts to clean up the river had begun from the late 1960s, it had been a slow-moving process, with multiple government agencies involved. In February 1977, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who was Prime Minister at that time, said that it should be a â€œtarget in 10 yearsâ€ for the river to be clean enough for fishing. 
He also said, â€œThe day we achieve that, whoever has been in charge for the last 10 years or for the next 10 years, if I am still around, I will give each one of themâ€¦ a real solid gold medal, one troy ounce (31.1 grams).â€ Each medal was worth around $1,000 then.

The clean-up of the Singapore River and Kallang Basin involved the relocation of shipyards and more than 4,000 squatters, and the removal of waste on various levels along the river â€“ discarded boats that choked the flow, mounds of rubbish floating and submerged in the water, and debris that had accumulated on the riverbed.
Since the clean-up, the Singapore River has been creatively used â€“ for tours, light-ups, carnivals, and more. This photo shows one of the earlier events to be held there â€“ the Singapore River Carnival in 1986, which was part of the Singapore Tourism Board's â€œMerlion Weekâ€. Rowers raced against each other in colourful animal-themed boats. Here's hoping the frog in this photo was a swift one!

Working Out Inside
As Nadine helps Gong Gong wash the dishes, she surprises him by saying something extra sweet for a nine-year-old who didn't completely look forward to spending all this time with him. Gong Gong asks Nadine what she misses about the (usual) school holidays, in a time like thisâ€¦
The newspaper clipping of the Great Singapore Workout below is a retro version of the many exercise videos that are available online today. Launched by then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on 3 October 1993, the workout was meant to help Singaporeans adopt a healthier lifestyle (and have fun while doing it).
The launch entered the Guinness Book of Records that year, with a crowd of 26,107 at the Padang participating in the largest mass aerobic session held at one location. (There have been even larger mass aerobic events since â€“ though that doesn't make the 1993 feat any less impressive!)
Lianhe Zaobao article on the Great Singapore Workout (3 October 1993, Paper. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
The workout is about 15 minutes long, and is meant to involve every part of your body (and family â€“ â€œCome on, Dad, come on, Mum, family fitness is so much fun!â€). Watch the whole video here!

As they cool down, another idea pops into Nadine's head â€“ would Gong Gong like to sing with her? That Great Singapore Workout tune was quite catchyâ€¦ How she misses singing!
Even after singing many songs with Gong Gong (a mix of his favourites, and hers), Nadine couldn't get the Great Singapore Workout song out of her head. â€œIt's Singapore, Singaporeâ€¦ Workout time!â€
Music was another great way to encourage people to change their behaviour and it still is commonly used in Singapore! Does â€œLet's test, let's trace, let's vaccinate!â€ sound familiar to you?
Our museums also use an animated video and jingle to show children how they should behave in galleries. It's full of alliterative refrains â€“ â€œwalk and whisper!â€, â€œflash-free photos!â€. Check it out below.

Our delightful duo's conversation goes from music, toâ€¦ mascots?
What mascot would you create for a cause you believe in? Meet some of the mascots who have been introduced to Singapore over the years (though many seem to have been created in the early 1980s).
â€œSmiley Squirrelâ€ bookmark with slogan, â€œInvest in your future, save nowâ€ (c. 1988, Paper, Gift of POSBank. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
Squirrels save their food for rainy days (literally â€“ as they can't go out to get food then) â€“ that's why Smiley Squirrel was chosen as POSB's friendly mascot. Smiley has been encouraging children to save money (not food) since 1983!
Courtesy campaign poster (1983, Paper, Gift of the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
Singa the Courtesy Lion was created in 1982 as the official mascot for Singapore's National Courtesy Campaign (now part of the Singapore Kindness Movement). The colours used â€“ orange and red â€“ are meant to reflect warmth and friendliness. In this poster, Singa encourages people to get to know their neighbours. The Chinese characters read, â€œDo you know your neighbour?â€.
Singapore Productivity News (1984, Paper. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
The National Productivity Board was established in 1972 to promote industrial productivity. Teamy, the Board's mascot, was introduced in 1982 and made its first appearance during National Productivity Month that same year. Singapore Productivity News was the Board's monthly newsletter, featuring a comic strip called â€œThe Adventures of Teamy the Beeâ€. Here, Teamy gets people charged up with his â€œbuzzwordsâ€ â€“ haha!
Mascot suit of Lyo, one of the two official mascots of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore (c. 2010, Foam, Gift of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
Lyo's name is an acronym for â€œLion of the Youth Olympicsâ€ â€“ how typically Singaporean it is to shorten a phrase into a handful of letters! He symbolises youthful energy, passion, and constant striving for excellence. He and his companion Merly are the first Youth Olympic Games mascots â€“ ever! (In 2010, Singapore was the first country to host the Youth Olympic Games.

Ask any Singaporean what the most important part of the local heritage is, and chances are, the answer would be Hawker Culture. From the world-famous chicken rice to the late night roti prata, the crowd-favourite laksa to the comforting flavours of nasi lemak, Singapore's hawkers have been feeding generations of people from all walks of life. Hawker food plays a much greater role than just filling our bellies â€“ it is a legacy that unites all Singaporeans.
From Boon Lay to Maxwell and to Bedok, hawker centres have become the nation's community dining rooms, where the office worker takes his usual morning breakfast perhaps in a hurry, while the retired senior digs into a bowl of noodles at his own leisure. Neighbours meet up regularly to catch up on news and gossip, parents dart from stall to stall to bring home their children's favourite dishes, and grandparents reminisce about the good old days over a cup of freshly brewed coffee. It all happens right here.
So where did our Hawker Culture come from? What does it represent for Singaporeans? To really understand the Singaporeans' love story with hawker food, we will have to journey right to the beginning, when our ancestors brought the very first hawker dishes from their homeland.

History of Hawker Culture
1800s â€“ The Origins
Singapore in the 1800s was a thriving port city which attracted migrants from China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and other lands, seeking a better life. They were hard labourers, merchants, clerks, and cooks who brought with them the comfort food they grew up with. They adapted these dishes to ingredients that were easily available here, and cooked them using local techniques, eventually creating a recognisable Singapore flavour.
Many immigrants saw street hawking as a good way to earn a living, as it required little capital. These early pioneers started to ply the streets, serving the dishes that they were most familiar with. The streets were bustling with activity, colours, aromas, and flavours. Chinese hawkers would carry their mobile kitchens around, balanced on a bamboo pole along with their ingredients and utensils, so they could serve up piping hot meals on the go. Malay hawkers typically sold fruits and flame grilled meat sticks, a dish that we would come to know as satay. Indian hawkers added colourful sweets, cakes, and jellies to the street scene. One could even see a hawker walking his cow or goat on the street, ready to â€œdispenseâ€ fresh milk whenever a customer demanded.

With just three cents, anyone could afford a sumptuous meal of three to four dishes, served up at a moment's notice. On the same street, one could easily savour the flavours from different parts of Asia, catered to local tastes. This vibrant beginning marked the first chapters of Singapore's hawker story.
Up to 1960s â€“ A need for regulation
After the Second World War, many who were unemployed turned to hawking as a profession, and that was when the street hawker scene became a thriving world of possibilities.

Diners sit on wooden stools around the stall facing the hawker who would take their orders and serve the food hot from the pot. Hawkers usually wear cotton shorts or pants with white cotton sleeved tee shirts to keep themselves cool and comfortable. (1965. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)
However, not everyone shared the optimistic view of Singapore's street hawker scene. In 1950, Governor F. Gimson set up the Hawkers Inquiry Commission and in the Hawkers Inquiry Report, it was stated that â€œThere is undeniably a disposition among officials ... to regard the hawkers as primarily a public nuisance to be removed from the streets.â€
The hawkers in Singapore during that time usually did not have easy access to water. This made it difficult to keep their utensils clean and prevent contamination by flies and rats. Without a properly assigned disposal area, hawkers often left piles of refuse on the streets, posing a threat to public health and hygiene. Many who were selling cold drinks, cut fruits, and ice cream used water and ice that might be easily contaminated, potentially causing outbreaks of cholera and typhoid.
Another issue the government faced was the challenge in street cleaning as the entire physical space where the hawkers plied their trade was viewed as a disorderly obstruction to traffic and city planning. As such, the colonial government started looking for ways to regulate the hawkers and relocate them.
Late 1960s to 1980s â€“ The first hawker centres
After Singapore's independence in 1965, along with the move to turn Singapore into the region's business hub, the work of licensing hawkers and relocating them into more organised spaces picked up momentum. In 1968 and 1969, the government conducted an islandwide registration of street hawkers, issuing temporary licenses and moving them into back lanes, car parks, and vacant plots of land.
Street hawkers at Trengganu Street. After the 1980s, street hawkers no longer plied the streets as permanent hawker centres were set up. (1971. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)
Despite this move, illegal hawking remained rampant. In 1974, the Hawker's Department Special Squad was formed to handle the situation. Public Health Inspectors, who were responsible for keeping illegal hawkers off the streets, were given handsets similar to those used by the police and could use them to relay information and seek backup assistance while CISCO officers escorted them on the ground. These new measures proved especially effective against the illegal pasar malam (night markets) that sprung up across the city.
Enforcement was not all bad news. From 1971 to 1986, the government sought to relocate up to 18,000 hawkers to markets and hawker centres with proper amenities, so hawkers could have a safe and hygienic place to work without having to run from the inspectors.
The Housing Development Board (HDB) was responsible for the meticulous planning of every hawker centre to make sure that they were in well-populated areas. Each hawker centre was built within walking distance for most residents of the HDB estate, or a short bus ride away, while not being too close to one another. Chomp Chomp Food Centre, Block 51 Old Airport Road, and Tiong Bahru Market were among the first hawker centres to serve up mouth-watering Singaporean delicacies in this exciting new era of the hawker story.

1980s to present â€“ Building a legacy
The five-year span between 1974 to 1979 saw 54 hawker centres built to serve residents and workers across the nation. Different architectural and design themes gave each hawker centre their unique touch. Newton Hawker Centre, for example, was built in 1971 with the idea of having â€œhawker stalls in a garden settingâ€ with trees for shade, hedges and shrubs alongside a car park and a public toilet. The last food centre to be erected during this phase was Block 505 Market and Food Centre at Jurong West Street 52, in 1986.

Today, more than 110 hawker centres are located across Singapore, and there are plans to construct even more to better cater to our population (data extracted from the website of the National Environment Agency).
â€œHawker centres represent the culinary soul of Singapore, where everyone regardless of race and social background gathers for their daily meals. I grew up having meals at hawker centres and hope that my daughter gets to enjoy the same culinary experience as I do.â€
Hugo Bart, frequent patron at hawker centres
Even our hawkers have chosen to continue their family's legacy by carrying on the trade that their parents or grandparents had started. More than half of today's hawkers are second and third generation hawkers, most of them specialising in a particular dish, refining the recipes that have been passed down to them, and sometimes adding adventurous twists to their flavours.

Haron Satay & Chicken Wing has come a long way from being razed by a fire in 2013 to the passing of their founder in 2016. Regulars nicknamed the satay as bakar-ed satay Haron as a tribute to the late Mr Haron Abu Bakar who founded the Satay in 1978. (2018. Photo courtesy of National Heritage Board.)
â€œMy customers are like my close friends; I can even say some are like extended family. As a hawker, I don't just sell the food, I share the culture and heritage to my fellow Singaporeans.â€
Mdm Muthuletchmi, Hawker at Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre
Gearing up for the Future
The Hawker Centres Upgrading Program (HUP) was launched in February 2001 to improve the dining experience at hawker centres, both for the hardworking hawkers and the patrons. Upgraded hawker centres enjoy re-tiling, new tables and seats, replacement of utility services, rewiring, improvement to the ventilation, bin centres and toilets, re-roofing where necessary, and provision of exhaust flue systems. Some centres even go through a complete reconfiguration or rebuilding. In addition to central freezer areas, central wash areas are also set up for sorting out used crockery. While the space is not air-conditioned to keep operating costs down and to preserve the traditional atmosphere and charm of hawker centres, barrier-free access has been prioritised to facilitate the movement of patrons in wheelchairs.
This is the Old Kallang Airport Hawker Centre which replaced the previous wet market in 1971. All stalls at this food centre are let out on rental basis and priority is given to residents of Old Kallang Airport Estate. Behind the row of stalls is the Mobil petrol station on Old Airport Road. (1983. Photo courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.)
In 2019, the government announced that 13 new hawker centres will be built by the year 2027. This new chapter would inject new energy into Singapore's Hawker Culture, combined with the latest technologies in automation and sustainability, while preserving the heritage and authenticity of our hawker centres. The new hawker centre in Bukit Panjang, for example, is built with a trellis at its roof garden to allow for the installation of solar panels. Other sustainable features include a pneumatic waste conveyance system that will transport waste automatically to a central station through a network of pipes, so that cleaning would be more efficient and effective.
Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre features eco-friendly designs such as high roof ceilings for better ventilation, an open dining area to maximise natural lighting, and wide usage of louvres to utilise natural light while giving shade. It also introduces a green wall to promote a more sustainable ecosystem in the neighbourhood. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Heritage Board.)
Honouring our Hawker Culture
The story of our Hawker Culture would never have been written if not for the passion of hawkers, and the support of community groups, the government, and food-loving Singaporeans. The rich culinary offerings of our hawker centres represent the Chinese, Malay, Indian, and other communities that call this country home. In recent years, international cuisine has also made its way into the heartlanders' bellies. Patrons today can enjoy fish and chips, Japanese udon sets, Hong Kong dim sum, and even Korean kimchi at their favourite hawker centres.
â€œOur family is always looking into new ways to excite our customers without losing the touch of our traditional roots. It's not just food; we are serving a legacy.â€
Afiq Rezza bin Norrezat, Hawker at Ang Mo Kio Market & Food Centre
Safeguarding Singapore's Hawker Culture
There are four pillars to the safeguarding of Singapore's Hawker Culture â€“ Transmission, Research and Documentation, Support and Promotion. These are demonstrated through the collaborative efforts among government agencies, hawkers, training institutions, community organisations, academia, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals.
Transmission
Hawkers are encouraged to pass down their culinary practices to apprentices or family members. This is demonstrated through initiatives such as the Hawkers' Development Programme, introduced by the National Environment Agency and Skills Future Singapore to teach aspiring hawkers about the culinary secrets of experienced hawkers, and to provide apprenticeships, to ensure that our hawker favourites will continue to be served for generations to come.
Comprising three stages (training, apprenticeship, running an incubation stall), the Hawkers' Development Programme aims to equip both existing and aspiring hawkers with the relevant skills and competencies to run their businesses at #OurHawkerCentres. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Environment Agency.)
Research and documentation
Local food advocates and community organisations have been actively documenting the country's rich hawker heritage and recipes of local delights. This culture has even piqued the interests of academics and experts. This rich library of publications, editorials, and multimedia materials continue to grow, providing the public with a comprehensive resource pool to further enrich their love for local food.
Support
Organisations such as the Federation of Merchants' Associations, Singapore (FMAS), as well as other hawkers' associations and representatives, work closely with the government to provide support and additional resources for our hawkers. The National Environmental Agency (NEA) has also set up an Incubation Stall Programme to encourage aspiring hawkers to set up their stalls with a lower start-up cost and pre-fitted basic equipment. Together, these organisations have also organised the Hawkers' Seminar to encourage hawkers to come together to exchange ideas and strengthen the survivability of the culture.
Ms Chong Chiew Fung decided to give up her job as a quantity surveyor to venture into the hawker trade through the NEA'S Incubation Stall Programme. (2020. Photo courtesy of National Environment Agency.)
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, support schemes, grants and courses on digital solutions were offered to help hawkers tide through the difficult period.
Promotion
Heritage and food enthusiasts, as well as museums and other organisations have launched exhibitions and campaigns to help promote Singapore's Hawker Culture. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), such as Slow Food Singapore, have also been organising different workshops and programmes to educate students and the wider community about our food heritage, while private entities like Eat.Shop.Play have tapped on digital and social media to promote hawker stalls in Singapore.

UNESCO Inscription of Hawker Culture in Singapore
Our Hawker Culture resonates strongly with locals across all ethnicities and social strata, and it is also something that Singaporeans are proud to showcase on the international stage.
On 16 December 2020, Hawker Culture in Singapore was successfully inscribed as Singapore's first element on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, with the unanimous support of the Intergovernmental Committee for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage. The inscription reflected our Hawker Culture's significance in Singaporeans' multicultural identity as a people, and as a nation, and affirms our commitment to safeguard it for future generations.
From hawker plates to global palates
So, what does it mean for Singaporeans for our hawker culture to be inscribed as the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity? For the nation, it confirms our international standing as a culinary destination on the world map. For our hawkers, this is a recognition that their years of hard work have shaped Singapore's culture for entire generations. For our food lovers, it is a testament of our passionate late-night visits to Chomp Chomp and our weekend trips across the island just to enjoy a bowl of laksa â€“ a culinary love story that is forever written in history.
Hawker Culture in Singapore will continue into the future, so that our future generations can continue to enjoy the food passed down from our ancestors. (2018. Photo Courtesy of National Heritage Board.)
For generations to come, every Singaporean will continue to enjoy the traditional flavours from their heritage and various ethnic groups. Each bowl of soup, each plate of rice, and each cup of coffee â€“ made with two centuries of passion and pride through the hard work and creativity of hawkers who adapted to the changing times and needs of communities.

Listen to Professor Emeritus John Miksic, eminent archaeologist and historian of Southeast Asia at the National University of Singapore, as he provides some insights into the nature of pre-colonial Malay warfare in 14th century Singapore.
Also, get the chance to learn more about the Ipoh Tree and the uses of its poison sap in pre-colonial Malay warfare by watching the video below.
Interview with Professor John Norman Miksic
Ipoh Tree
Interview with Professor John Norman Miksic
In this video, Professor Miksic shares about the defensive importance of a wall that provided protection against Javanese attacks in 14th century Singapore. Professor Miksic remarks that Stamford Raffles looked for the remains of this very wall upon his 1819 arrival in Singapore, having read the Malay Annals and found it along what is now Stamford Road near the National Museum of Singapore. Raffles found an earthen wall that stretched for a kilometre, with a natural stream of water flowing along it that originated from what is now Mount Sophia. The wall was about 8 to 9 feet high and 16 feet wide at the base, or 2.75 metres in height and 4 metres.
Professor Miksic adds that the remains of the earthen wall which Raffles found was what existed after 500 years of erosion, and that the original wall must have been much bigger and more formidable. He postulates that thorny bamboo might have been planted at the top of the wall to deter attackers.
Professor Miksic also shares about the nature of pre-colonial Malay weaponry, with weapons like keris, spears and poisoned blowguns featuring prominently in warfare against the Portuguese in 1511 CE.
Ipoh Tree
In this video, the project's principal investigator, Dr Effendy, takes us through a journey to explore the Ipoh Tree, how Singapore actually has one such example growing in the Singapore Botanic Gardens and how the tree's sap was extracted for use as poison in pre-colonial warfare.
We learn that the Ipoh tree, or upas tree, contains a special sap that can be extracted for use as poison. When a wound is inflicted with the Ipoh tree's poison, it causes paralysis, convulsions and results in a heart attack.
We also learn that the antidote for the Ipoh tree's potent poison is actually the common limau nipis, or kalamansi. Once some kalamansi is squeezed into the wound area and with the ingression of some dry earth, there is an antidote effect.

The Need for Needles
Hi! Welcome to Gong Gong's dining room, which has served as nine-year-old Nadine's cafÃ© for the last two days. She's at her Gong Gong's home during the May holidays as her parents have to be at work for long hours.
Right now, Gong Gong and Nadine are in the middle of a chat about one of their favourite people â€“ Nadine's mum (or, Gong Gong's daughter). Nadine finds it hard to believe that her mum, whom she's always known to be calm, fearless, sometimes funny but mostly strict, was once a child!
Psst! This chapter's illustrations are by Joy Ho, an illustrator, cartoonist, and designer, whose works often take the form of ink or digital pieces â€“ like scratchy dog comics or colourful, embodied smiley faces.
Vaccinations to give children immunity against common diseases have been administered in Singapore since as early as 1869 (when smallpox vaccination was made compulsory).
Certificate of Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) testing and vaccination (1962, Paper, Gift of Mr Heng Lee Kok. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
The BCG is the vaccine against tuberculosis, which was the top killer disease in Singapore in the post-war years before it subsided in the 1960s. Tuberculosis (also known as phthisis â€“ try pronouncing that â€“ or the white plague) is an air-borne bacterial infectious disease. From the mid-1950s onwards, BCG immunisation was administered at birth.

Many Singaporeans would also remember taking the BCG vaccination in school when they were 12 years old. However, the vaccine is most effective at preventing infants and young children from contracting severe forms of childhood tuberculosis, rather than adults. As such, BCG revaccination by the School Health Service was discontinued on 1 July 2001.
The Belles of CHIJMES
Now Nadine is really curious! â€œWhat was Mum like at my age? What was her childhood like?â€
Founded in 1854, the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) is the oldest Catholic girls' school in Singapore. The compound comprised primary and secondary schools, the Chinese-medium St Nicholas Girls' School (which moved into the premises in 1949), an orphanage, nuns' quarters, and a chapel.
The red-roofed building in the illustration is Caldwell House. Built in 1840 / 1841, it is the oldest building in the compound (and among the oldest surviving buildings in Singapore), and where the school began. On the second floor, in a circular room, was where the sisters (the IJ Sisters â€“ not biological ones! â€“ who taught the girls) used to work. They did needlework and marked homework, among other things.
Photograph of school assembly at CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School (c. 1950s, Paper. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore)
This school chapel, the tallest building in the compound, was completed in 1903 â€“ an earlier one had become too small for the ever-expanding school. The spire is five storeys high and stained-glass windows depict the life events of Jesus, and profiles of the twelve apostles. Beyond bringing colour and beauty into the chapel, stained glass was also used to teach those who could not read, to help them understand Bible stories and religious teachings through images.

The former CHIJ Chapel and Caldwell House were collectively gazetted as a National Monument in 1990, and today they are part of CHIJMES (pronounced â€œchimesâ€), an entertainment complex. Today, CHIJMES is open to the public â€“ if you do go there, see if you can spot a lizard lurking on one of the columns between the chapel and Caldwell House. Say hello, it may be feeling lonely!

The Convent moved out to Toa Payoh in 1983, and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School moved to Ang Mo Kio. There are now eleven CHIJ schools across Singapore.

Old School Daze
As Nadine looks through old photographs, she realises that apart from class photographs, where mum and her classmates look shy and somewhat stiff, there aren't many other photographs showing her mum at school.
Gong Gong closes his eyes and tries to recall his daughter's school days. He remembers fragments from when he used to pick her up from school each day â€“ her favourite food at the canteen was the braised chicken wing, how she loved to sing Majulah Singapura even when her classmates kept quiet and how her classmates used to make shadow figures on the overhead projector.
Gong Gong realises that Nadine wouldn't know what overhead projectors are, and he explains that teachers used to write on transparent plastic sheets, which would then be projected onto a screen in the classroom. â€œOoh, sometimes my teachers write on their PowerPoint slides! Is that the same thing?â€ â€œI suppose that's similar,â€ Gong Gong nods obligingly.
Watch: Semoga Bahagia
A musical thread connecting generations of Singapore is Semoga Bahagia (â€œMay You Achieve Happinessâ€), which is taught in primary schools and sung on Children's Day.
Zubir Said's Piano (Late 1950s, Wood, metal. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)

The Days Flashing By
At Nadine's enthusiastic encouragement, Gong Gong brings out more photos of Nadine's mum and family. Through the pictures, Nadine catches a glimpse of 1980s Singapore, featuring East Coast Park and Van Kleef Aquarium (Singapore's first public aquarium, named after a Dutchman who resided in Singapore in the late 19th and early 20th centuries)â€¦
Rollei XF35 rangefinder camera with case and lens cover (1970s. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore)
When it was first released in 1974, the Rollei XF35 rangefinder camera was one of the world's smallest full-frame 35mm cameras. (Now we take photos on much smaller devices, but it was small for its time).
The words on the top of this camera read â€œMADE IN SINGAPOREâ€. Rollei, a German manufacturer, set up its first production factory in Singapore at Alexandra Road, in 1971. Rollei moved out of Singapore in 1981 after their parent company went bankrupt.

Set of kuti-kuti (1960s, Metal. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
This is a set of kuti-kuti, a favourite game among children from the late 1940s to the 1980s. Players would attempt to flip their kuti-kuti on top of their opponents' to win the game and their piece. Kuti-kuti sets usually consist of colourful translucent plastic shaped like animals or fruits. This set is uniquely made of metal and includes objects like an umbrella and even features some human figures.
Each player takes out [a kuti-kutiâ€¦] and then you use your finger to push it forward and try to get [it] on top of your opponent's. So, certain figures are better because let's say it's a giraffe or elephant, it's got a slightly thicker body, and its neck or snout is sticking out. It's got a better chance to get over the opponent's [piece].
Margaret Thomas, in an oral history recording by the National Archives of Singapore
Tikam board (1979, Paper. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.)
Tikam-tikam (â€œrandom pickâ€) is a lucky draw game that was often found at drink stalls. To play, you'd pay a small sum of money (5 to 20 cents) to pull off your selected tab, and then see if you happened to get a winning one. Prizes (which were decided on by the stall owner) often included soft drinks, a packet of biscuits, a plastic toy, orâ€¦ more money (in the range of tens of cents)!
Farrer Park
by Ann Peters
I have grown up and gone away
Left my childhood behind
At least this is what I always say
Until something brings it to mind.
A word, a memory will raise it up
From where it had quietly lain
Raking the earth and ancient dust
And I'm back in my childhood again.

Dr Mohamed Effendy
This project began with the simple objective of recording the history, culture, and origins of Malay martial art groups in Singapore. It has done so successfully and uncovered information that could possibly lead to more nuanced insights into the origins and development of the Singapore Malay community and more.
The project has established that many of the early members of Malay martial arts groups migrated to Singapore during the 19th and early 20th century from various parts of Southeast Asia such as Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, the Riau-Lingga islands and the Malay Peninsula.
The videos and accompanying writeups that you see on this page were part of what the research team collated as part of its research over a two-year period from 2018 to 2020.
Although the videos and writeups cannot realistically claim to capture all possible angles, we nevertheless hope that they will contribute in a small way towards the preservation of the history, culture, and origins of these silat groups.

Amanca Temasek (Singapore)
The Amanca Temasek silat school's style originates from the Bugis of South Sulawesi in modern-day Indonesia. The style is called Unru Pitu in the Bugis language, or Sendeng Tujuh in Malay. It is said to have been passed down to Bugis royalty and especially their protectors for many generations. The school's silat style is a very practical style that emphasises a quick takedown of the opponent. It has six essential striking moves and focuses greatly on training the student to survive an engagement no matter the odds. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Bandangan Asli & Seligi Tunggal (Singapore)
The Bandangan Asli silat style was taught in Singapore during the 1930s at areas like Bras Brasah, Tank Road and Fernhill Village. It is currently taught by the silat guru Mr Muhamad Irwan bin Muhamad Arsek to his students from the Bandangan Asli silat school. This video also shows Mr Hamzah Ifi, the direct descendent of Ifi Suhoor, introducing himself and the silat Seligi Tunggal moves.
As a child, Guru Irwan followed his father to various villages around Singapore to conduct silat training. Guru Irwan hopes to continue his father's legacy in educating the young in silat and get them to better appreciate the beauty and uniqueness of this martial art technique. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Bandangan Jati (Singapore)
The Bandangan Jati silat school's style is of Baweanese origin. It is underpinned by values like kejujuran (honesty) and amanah (trustworthiness), and the inner emphasis that a pendekar (warrior) should be a good role model for society. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore
Benderang Persada (Singapore)
The Benderang Persada silat school style is characterised by a focus on adaptability, aesthetics and discipline. As part of the school's training, its students learn strikes and â€˜seni', or the aesthetic forms. The school also focuses on Olah Raga (sports silat) and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) and teaches its students how to adapt to any situation they might face. Students are taught how to be disciplined and respectful, as these are key foundations for future success. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Chakra Lima (Singapore)
The Chakra Lima silat school's style is characterised by swift and abrupt movements. It has been passed down for many generations in Surabaya, Indonesia and is said to have been founded in the 14th century by Senopati Ario Bijjanan (1389-1487), who developed it to protect the rulers of the kingdom of Madura. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Persatuan Seni Silat Setia Hati (ESHA) Singapura (Singapore)
The Persatuan Seni Silat Setia Hati (ESHA) Singapura silat school's style is characterised by physical moves and athletic, fast and strong strike movements. This is due to the impact of Javanese silat influence on the school's silat style, which emphasises animal styles, such as the monkey, which is athletic and fast and the tiger, which has strong strike moves. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Silat Seni Gayong PASAK Singapura (Singapore)
The Silat Seni Gayong PASAK silat school style is characterised by a focus on rigorous combat moves, aesthetics and discipline. The school incorporates various unarmed and armed combat moves as part of its syllabus. The school's silat style places emphasis on discipline, traditions and culture as the key foundation upon which the young can develop their personal capabilities and skills. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Note: Guru Rahim bin Kaslan passed away in May 2020 but we were fortunate to have made this recording in July 2019.
Perguruan Silat Seni Gayong Singapura (Singapore)
The Perguruan Silat Seni Gayong Singapura silat school was established in 2009. It aims to teach the young discipline and good moral values through silat training. The school's training places emphasis on getting the basics right for a strong silat practitioner, just like how a strong moral foundation is necessary to accomplish good things in life. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Gerak Silat Olah Raga (GRASIO)
The Gerak Silat Olah Raga (GRASIO) silat style is a rigorous silat style that requires disciples to graduate through 25 levels of training and master 25 different silat styles. The school's syllabus is a diverse and organized one which contains both artistic (seni) and sports silat (olah raga) elements. The school also teaches its students to be respectful, humble, truthful, and responsible at all times, and to pass on these values to others around them in a virtuous cycle for society's benefit. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Perguruan Silek Harimau Minangkabau (Singapore)
The Perguruan Silek Harimau Minangkabau silat school's style is inspired by the movement and characteristics of the tiger. It originates from West Sumatra and is characterised by a very low fighting technique, where the fighter keeps close to the ground. The school's silat style is known for its ""kuncian"" (lock) and ""tangkapan"" (capture) moves. An opponent is immobilised after being struck and locking moves are done on the hands, feet, and neck to bring him or her to the ground. The pain caused by the locks is effective in neutralising an opponent's will to fight. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Kembang Wali (Singapore)
The Kembang Wali silat school's style is of Central Javanese origin. The school's name is made up of two words; â€œKembangâ€ is the Javanese word for bunga or flower, while â€œWaliâ€ indicates that the silat style is derived from Sunan Kalijaga, one of the nine famous saints or wali of Indonesia. The school combines three distinctive silat styles from Central Java: the tiger (harimau, or macan in Javanese), the snake (ular) and â€œSemarâ€ (a guardian spirit of Java). This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Kuntau Asli (Singapore)
The Kuntau Asli silat style is influenced by Northeast Asian martial art styles. It is characterised by an emphasis on aggressiveness and swift movements to bring down an opponent.
Macan Pasrah (Singapore)
The Macan Pasrah silat style is influenced by the movements of the tiger. It is characterised by significant movements from each of the 12 Sunda silat styles based on actual fighting experiences with silat masters from the Sunda region of Indonesia. The school places a focus on kindness and humility in its teachings in hopes of producing high-calibre students and teachers for the school. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Pekiti-Kali Tirsa (Singapore)
The Pekiti-Kali Tirsa school was established in the early 2010s and places emphasis on the mastery of triangular footwork in order to be a successful martial arts practitioner. The martial art practiced by the teachers and students is of Filipino origin but it has very close cultural and historical proximities to many Malay-Indonesian martial art systems.
Pencak Bawean Dheun (Singapore)
The Pencak Bawean Dheun silat school's style is characterised by the use of deceptive moves to confuse an opponent. The school places emphasis on following old traditions, especially the adab and adat (traditional mannerisms and etiquette) of learning the art of the Bawean sword. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-singapore-river-where-cultures-and-communities-meet/story,"Office workers unwind at watering holes along the riverfront, while tourists snap selfies with historic monuments and sites that pepper the area â€“ all this against a backdrop of towering skyscrapers, and river taxis that cut colourful paths across the water. This is the picturesque Singapore River we know so well.
But, it wasn't always so. Cue the tales told in our history books of early immigrants toiling along the quayside godowns, or the mammoth clean-up campaign in the 1970s, which gave our beloved river a much needed â€œfaceliftâ€. And of course, there are the not too distant memories of chomping on satay at old haunts such as the Satay Club.
The Singapore River is a story about change; of how a river, as a lifeline to generations of Singaporeans over the years, contributed to the success of Singapore. Here, five objects from our National Collection bring you more stories to remember about the Singapore River.
The Singapore River Was Whereâ€¦
...the legendary Singapore Stone sat...
Fragment of the Singapore Stone, 10th â€“ 14th centuries.
Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Singapore's founding in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles was the introduction for many to Singapore's history.
Contrary to this, history shows that Singapore was probably already a vibrant, thriving island long before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles. The Singapore Stone, an ancient relic that was discovered in 1819 at the mouth of the Singapore River, is an iconic marker of Singapore's pre-1819 history.
The original stone measured 3m by 3m in its day. Legend even points to it as the boulder hurled by Badang â€“ a folk hero known for his great strength who served the king of Singapura in 14th century Singapore - during a contest with a foreign champion.
Unfortunately, a British engineer blew up the stone in 1843 during a project to widen the river mouth, and a fragment survives today at the National Museum of Singapore.
Inscribed with an indecipherable script which some experts have claimed to be old Javanese or Sanskrit (Sir Stamford Raffles himself guessed the script to be of Indian origin), the Singapore Stone continues to baffle historians even till today.
...Singapore's first â€œBankersâ€ traded
Chettiar moneylender's pettagam (storage chest), 1930s.
Collection of the National Museum of Singapore. Gift of Mr Subbiah Lakshmanan.
As a trading emporium and centre of commerce, the early days of the Singapore River saw Indian Chettiars from Tamil Nadu play the role of Singapore's first financiers.
Arriving in the 1820s, they opened moneylending businesses in the Singapore River area, primarily along Chulia Street and Market Street.
Back then, the average Chettiar would sit cross-legged on the ground floor of a kittangi (warehouse). The pettagam, or storage chest, served as a desk on which they conducted their business.
A kittangi provided all the services of a modern bank for Singapore's early entrepreneurs. They financed everything from rubber to real estate. They provided working capital loans, took deposits and even offered fund transfers.
With the passing of time, the descendants of Singapore's Chettiar community went on to take up other professions.
...secret societies thrived
Chinese secret society identification token, undated
Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Secret societies were rampant along the river banks during the 19th century. Tokens were carried around by society members, for secret identification of their roles within the society hierarchy.
Early Chinese immigrants fresh off the boats in Singapore were often greeted by secret society members who would call to them in their native dialects, offering friendship, a sense of belonging and identity, and practical assistance.
For many, joining the ranks of these secret societies was the easiest way to link up with a towkay or businessman in order to get jobs pulling rickshaws or picking gambier.
The brokers of these secret societies in China would even offer to pay for their boat fare to Singapore if they could not afford it. As a result, many of the poorer immigrants would step off their ships already saddled with years' worth of debt.
In their prime, the secret societies were immensely powerful. They collected protection money from the riverside godowns, operated gambling dens, brothels and opium houses. By 1881, nearly half of the 73,000 Chinese immigrants in Singapore were members.
The social disorder caused by the existence of these secret societies eventually forced the colonial government to intervene directly. Despite being outlawed in 1889, their presence continued to be felt well into the 20th century.
...Godowns for Gambier and other Spices were
Drawing of Gambier from the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, early 19th century.
Collection of the National Museum of Singapore. Gift of Mr G.K. Goh.
In the early 19th century, the gambier plant, a key ingredient in tanning leather, was one of Singapore's most popular cultivation crops.
Alongside pepper, it was grown on plantations around Caldecott, Nee Soon and Sembawang. After harvest, the leaves of the plant were boiled down, squeezed and dried to make an extract that resembles burnt marshmallows.
From there, it was carted to shops along the Singapore River. Clarke Quay's oldest building, the River House, was once a godown that stored gambier.
In the 1830s, Singapore's gambier industry flourished, largely due to demand from British tanning businesses. Many gambier plantation owners made their fortunes from this thriving trade, including Singapore pioneer Seah Eu Chin who was also known as â€œGambier Kingâ€.
...we enjoyed our favourite hawker fare
Empress Place Food Centre, 1985.
Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore
From 1973 to the 1990s, there was a popular hawker centre in front of the Former Empress Place Building (now the Asian Civilisations Museum).
Known as the Empress Place Food Centre, it was among the first hawker centres built during an island-wide effort to move hawkers off the streets.
Itinerant street hawkers had always plied their trade around the Singapore River, but their growing numbers, coupled with poor hygiene practices, attracted disease-spreading pests and compromised food safety.
Moving street hawkers into designated locations greatly improved the standards of food safety and hygiene. Today, hawker centres remain an indelible part of the lives of Singaporeans, and our shared food culture.

Pencak Sendeng (Singapore)
The Pencak Sendeng silat school style is characterised by a focus on defending the seven body areas of the eyes, nose, mouth, neck, chest, and groin areas from injury by the enemy. It is defensive in nature and requires a lengthy training period. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Pokolan Bawean (Singapore)
The Pokolan Bawean silat school style originates from Bawean island in Indonesia. It involves the use of empty hand techniques, locks, counter-locks, and strikes to achieve victory over an opponent. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore. Training takes place at various locations, like Bedok North, Pasir Ris, and Kembangan in Singapore today.
Pokolan Lian (Singapore)
The Pokolan Lian silat school's style combines the martial arts moves of two silat styles from Indonesia; the Pokolan style from Bawean island and the Lian style from Banten island. It places emphasis on discipline, character, and the use of one's energies to help the less fortunate in whatever ways possible. The school's students must agree to abide by certain conditions before being accepted by the school. They must agree to be taught by a teacher, follow instructions at all times and be trained at a place designated by the school as a training ground. Students must prepare any food and water for refreshment themselves, and have a strong heart due to the nature of the long and difficult training. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Seligi Tunggal Angkatan (Singapore)
The Seligi Tunggal Angkatan silat school is characterised by the tough training of its students. The school places emphasis on physical and mental fortitude, and teaches students to never be satisfied with what one has but to constantly strive for greater achievements. Over the years, the school has expanded over the years from its original training ground location in Woodlands to other locations around Singapore, like Bukit Panjang, Newton, Tanglin, Boon Lay, Marsiling, and Toa Payoh. Training takes place in the community centres of these suburban towns in Singapore.
Seligi Tunggal Singapura (Singapore)
The Seligi Tunggal Singapura silat school style is influenced by a combination of Bugis and Baweanese martial arts. It is characterised by sharp and steadfast punches. The school's name originates from two words. The word â€œSeligiâ€ translates to punch/strike in the Bugis language, whilst the word â€œtunggalâ€ means the one and only. Put together, the school name â€œSeligi Tunggalâ€ translates to â€œThe one and only school of the punch.â€ The school's core values are grounded in humility, respect for elders, and a strong basic foundation as being necessary for students before they can move on to more advanced silat techniques.
Sendeng Belalang (Singapore)
The Sendeng Belalang silat school style is characterised by the use of aesthetic moves and adaptability to changing circumstances. However, it is also very adaptable to modern day demands of silat, which has become more prominent as a sport than an art. The school's silat style combines elements from the Pokolan, Gayong and Cekak silat styles as the basis for its moves.
Sendeng Pukulan (Singapore)
The Sendeng Pukulan silat school's style is a combination of the silat style of two schools called â€˜sendeng' and â€˜pukulan'. It is characterised by an emphasis on attacking and never retreating. The school has placed emphasis on self-discipline and humility as a core foundation for its students since its founding in Singapore in 1989.
Sendeng Seturut (Singapore)
The Sendeng Seturut silat school's style is characterised by an emphasis on attacking strikes and hand-to-hand combat. The school also teaches its students to be well-grounded in values such as respect for the elderly and attaches great importance in guiding the students' physical and moral development.
Sendeng Tangkas (Singapore)
The Sendeng Tangkas silat school's style is characterised by physical locks and catching of the opponent's strikes. The school's silat style is a very practical style that emphasises a quick takedown of the opponent. It was established in 2014 in Singapore with the objective of encouraging more young Singaporeans to take up silat, and to educate the young in values such as discipline and good morals.
Si Rumpun Padi (Singapore)
The Si Rumpun Padi silat school's style is characterised by the use of a tekpi, or a short-handled trident, in armed combat. The tekpi is a versatile weapon that can be used by both hands, and can also be adapted to be both a defensive and offensive weapon. The school's name is derived from two words; â€œRumpunâ€ which means a collective, and â€œPadiâ€ which means rice and symbolises what the school's students will ideally develop into; that is, to be like the paddy which, when heavy with rice, looks like it is still bowing. This connotation means that even when students become better in terms of knowledge and skills, they should always be humble.
Silat Bunga (Singapore)
The Silat Bunga school's silat style is characterised by the use of â€œbungaâ€, or set moves, and â€œbuahâ€, or strikes, to achieve victory over an opponent. This silat style is said to originate from Solo in Central Java, Indonesia and was supposedly brought to Singapore during World War II. There are a total of 5 different types of â€œbungaâ€ set moves and many different â€œbuahâ€ strike forms. The premise behind the school's silat style is not to chase the enemy but to make him or her come over to be defeated. The school places emphasis on the values of teamwork and cooperation as the key to achieving success in silat and other matters in life.
Sunda Pajajaran (Singapore)
The Sunda Pajajaran silat school's style traces its origins to Sunda, Indonesia. It is characterised by an emphasis on preserving the traditional Sundanese martial arts style.
This silat style is always performed with traditional gamelan music and is often a crowd-puller. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Tapak Suci (Singapore)
The Tapak Suci silat school's style originates from the Jogjakarta region in Indonesia. It is physically demanding in nature and encompasses the use of specialised weapons like a sesgu, or metal truncheon, that can be used in either offensive or defensive stances. The school's teachings are grounded in an emphasis on maintaining good ethics and conduct at all times, and the development of mental and physical strength via discipline and rigorous training. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Seni Silat Titi Pinang (Singapore)
The Seni Silat Titi Pinang silat school's style is of Bugis origin. The school's silat moves are versatile and can be executed from standing or sitting postures. Taught by Mr Mr Mohamed Khamin Bin Said, the head guru of the Seni Silat Titi Pinang silat school, it has a signature double-punch move which is said to be very potent.
Note: Guru Mohamed Khamin passed away in December 2020. The research team was fortunate to have recorded the silat moves which Guru Khamin demonstrated for us in July 2019.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/our-hawker-culture-built-for-great-taste,"Introduction
Step into a hawker centre and your instincts kick in. It's where you sniff out iconic favourites, play the waiting game for a table, bump into familiar faces from the neighbourhood. Yet amidst the sights, smells and sounds of our beloved hawker centres, Singaporeans often overlook a fundamental feature of these community dining rooms - the architecture and design that makes it a staple destination for all.

About the Photographers
Growing with the community
From the 1960s, Singapore saw the construction of new housing estates such as Queenstown, Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio. Soon, the first hawker centres in Singapore began to emerge, serving as a central locale for the community, providing affordable, accessible food options, and a place to connect with neighbours.
As the 21st century rolled around, HDB estates were upgraded to accommodate the burgeoning population, and hawker centres were no exception. To promote and encourage inclusivity for the elderly and handicapped alike, more user-friendly features were added, from sheltered walkways to increased seating and wheelchair ramps.
Icons of Hawker Heritage
Often a centrepiece of their respective neighbourhoods, hawker centres come in all shapes and sizes, some with more unique features than others. From iconic faÃ§ades and traditional motifs, to varying typologies as seen through the building shape and roofs, hawker centres have grown to be an important part of Singapore's landscape and a reflection of our built heritage.
Tekka Market & Food Centre
Originally built in 1915, Upgraded in 1982
A prominent landmark in Singapore during the early 20th century, the original architecture of Tekka Market consisted of ornate steel carvings and multiple archways, inspired by colonial designs. Today, the Tekka Market & Food Centre has relocated across from the original site in 1982. It houses a wet market, shopping arcade and hawker centre, and is one of the largest establishments of its kind in Singapore.
According to photographer Rebecca Toh, the current use of colours for the market's faÃ§ade and interior complements the vibrancy of its hawkers and patrons. Splashes of green, yellow, orange and blue are reminiscent of its colourful history as a â€˜People's Market' where patrons of all ethnicities gathered for their daily marketing.

Tiong Bahru Market & Food Centre
Originally built in 1950, Upgraded between 2004-2006
Set in the iconic heritage neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru, the current building faÃ§ade pays homage to the Streamline Moderne and Art Deco architecture of its surrounding residential homes, an inspiration from its Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) foundation.
A hotspot for most of Singapore's hawker favourites, the stalls at Tiong Bahru Market are always abuzz with queues. Renovation works here helped to improve seating capacity, with ample room of approximately 1.2 metres between tables. To meet the needs of its elderly patrons, movable seats were introduced to improve wheelchair-access and better flow. A landscaped central courtyard allows natural light to flow into the dining area, and down to the wet market below. It also facilitates good ventilation for both hawkers and patrons.
The multiple open spaces within this building allows for increased interaction between members of the community as well as visiting locals, adding to the charm of this iconic neighbourhood.

Geylang Serai Market & Food Centre
Built between 1962-1964, Upgraded between 2006-2009
First established in 1964 as Pasar Geylang Serai, it consisted of a wet market, food centre and textile stalls under a single-storey zinc roof. This renowned spot underwent a major reconstruction, opening in 2009 as Geylang Serai Market & Food Centre, with beautiful new features and increased accessibility.
Modelled after a Malay kampung house, the new faÃ§ade allowed for natural ventilation and light to stream in, making it comfortable for patrons to enjoy their meals. Incorporating traditional motifs, the tiered roof resembles that of a thatched house, with woven baskets lining the ceiling as dÃ©cor. Raising the ceiling to twice its original height created a naturally ventilated dining hall.
An icon of the neighbourhood, the new seating arrangement accommodated for small and large family groups alike, maximising the number of customers to dine comfortably, and to instil a sense of community. The vast rows of stalls, amply spaced, allow patrons an overview of the variety of food stalls available, and to assess queues from the popular ones.

Commonwealth Crescent Market & Food Centre
Opened in 1969, Upgraded in 1998
Tucked between the mature estates of Queenstown and Commonwealth, this small yet popular establishment is home to some of the best local hawker fare.
In late 1998, it underwent a major transformation, turning into a two-storey market and food centre. Styled to provide a â€˜festive' atmosphere, its current facade consists of bright and cheery colours, with wave-like roof forms and canvas sail fixtures to mimic decorative banners and flags of a carnival.
A good balance of form and function, the stalls of this hawker centre are neatly laid out for patrons to easily assess queues, set around a central stairwell for ventilation. Despite being one of the smaller establishments, the dining layout is arranged to maximise room for larger groups, as well as private, smaller seat pockets for solo diners and wheelchair accessibility.

Adam Road Food Centre
Opened in 1974, Upgraded in 1997, 2001-2002, 2008 and again in 2016
A small yet iconic nod to the area's history, Adam Road Food Centre has overcome many challenges, from moving across the street from its original location to surviving constant floods. Multiple renovation works saw an increase in the height of the roof for improved ventilation, installation of new tiles and flooring to combat floods, and - for those who like the al fresco experience - umbrella-covered tables in the central courtyard.
During its upgrading closure, the sense of community of the hawkers here was so strong that they all chose to remain at Adam Road Food Centre, and were rewarded with a bigger, more beautiful home, that could accommodate up to 410 seated diners.
Not everything had been changed though. The building's unique nine-sided foundation remained, as well as a new and improved central courtyard. Outside, five old angsana trees were preserved, standing as the old guards of the place, where they functioned as sound barriers cutting the noise of the busy highway.

Changi Village Hawker Centre
Built in 1975, Upgraded in 2000 and again in 2012
Once a burgeoning area for the British military and their families, the Changi area played a pivotal role in the nation's history, both pre and post World War II. Still one of the most popular places for people in the area to visit, Changi Village Hawker Centre is also an iconic pit stop before taking a ferry to Pulau Ubin.
In similar fashion to East Coast Lagoon Food Village, this was styled as a seaside resort, exuding holiday vibes through its design and decor. Constructed with a well-ventilated open-air design, enticing patrons to dine-in with good food and even better company.

East Coast Lagoon Food Village
Built between 1977-1978, Upgraded between 2002-2004 and again in Nov 2020 till Feb 2021
An icon of Singapore's eastern coast, East Coast Lagoon Food Village is the only hawker centre on the island located by the beach. The region is synonymous with great eating outlets, and this is possibly the crown jewel.
The design of this hawker centre takes its cues from the district itself, complete with pitched roofs, generous overhangs and open-side structures reminiscent of the residential estates in the vicinity. With its reopening in 2004, the new architectural features exuded its beachside locale even more, with the use of cabana roofs and timber tables over sand, in a nod to seaside villa resorts.
A favourite among families, the renovations increased seating capacity and improved ventilation for everyone â€“ with the signature satay and barbecue stalls shifted outdoors, for better circulation and to entice diners passing by.

Hong Lim Market & Food Centre
Opened in 1978, Upgraded in 2009 and again in 2018
One of the earliest hawker centres built in the city, it housed most of the street hawkers from Hokkien Street. Set away from the busy traffic of Chinatown, it managed to retain a neighbourhood vibe, with residents from the surrounding HDB flats frequenting the building.
Upgrading works in 2009 looked to improve ventilation within the food centre, with additional seating built into the dining area, as well as wheelchair and handicap-friendly access to meet the growing needs of the elderly residents. Solar light tubes were also installed in the central void to help carry natural light into the centre of the structure.

Tampines Round Market and Food Centre
Opened in 1983, Upgraded in 2019
Situated in one of Singapore's largest residential estates, Tampines Round Market & Food Centre is easily one of its most recognisable landmarks, with its iconic pointed roof, and hawkers who have been there for over 30 years.
Upgraded in 2019, it is one of the most recent to see improved ventilation, creating a more inviting environment for the community. In comparison to the standard row upon row of stalls, Tampines Round Market lives up to its name - with stalls situated at the centre of the architecture, dining seats fanning outwards, and eventually forming a circular shape with the adjoining wet market This made for an easier survey of the stalls, and increased accessibility to the market without having diners block the aisles. A new drop-off point was constructed for improved traffic, and wheelchair-friendly spaces to accommodate all in the multi-generational neighbourhood.

Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre
Opened in 2005, Upgraded in 2019
Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre is an amalgamation of three west-side hawker centres - Corporation Drive Market, Corporate Drive Food Centre and Yung Sheng Food Centre. This food centre was created with patrons in mind, as the ventilation systems in place provided good circulation, and the variety of seats catered to big and small families alike.
Bringing the community together, the central courtyard allows for natural sunlight to stream in, and despite being far away from the seaside, exudes a holiday vibe through its al fresco dining area. Together with increased ventilation, the layout also allows for enhanced interaction between patrons, and for families to gather and enjoy a meal.

A New Generation
While the icons of hawker heritage underwent various stages of renovation, newer HDB estates saw a shortage of accessible dining outlets. In 2011, an announcement was made to build these community dining rooms in the newer neighbourhoods of Bukit Panjang, Hougang and Tampines, the first batch of new hawker centres in 26 years.
Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre
Opened in 2017
As Singapore's first integrated public development, Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre shares this â€˜Vertical Kampung' with housing services and commercial facilities to help maximise land area.
The Community Plaza sector of this establishment is where the hawker centre can be found, as part of a larger ecosystem with close proximity to healthcare, social spaces and commercial services in support of intergenerational bonding and active ageing. To cater to many patrons and for peak operational efficiency, the hawker centre includes a centralised dishwashing entrance and a seating capacity of 900.

Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre
Opened in 2018
Taking inspiration from all its predecessors, the Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre is a well-planned community dining room, blending tradition and modernity with its architecture and dÃ©cor - a nod to icons of the past and a step into the future of a growing population.
An homage to Singapore's history as a fishing village, the interior is designed with timber, foliage and raw concrete â€“ a modern spin on the kampung home. Catering to the growing young families in the district, the stalls and dining areas are arranged in a singular fan-shaped profile, facing the Pasir Ris Town Park, lush greenery for an immersive dining experience.
One of the newest hawker centres, it is purposefully built for natural ventilation, with a customised metal faÃ§ade panel system and high ceilings, for air to flow in and out with ease. Instead of cordoning off the building, intuitive landscaping is used to assimilate the building with the adjoining park.
Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre conducts a unique hawkerpreneurship programme to promote the hawker trade by nurturing younger Singaporeans to help keep hawker culture alive.

About the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme
The Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme is a collaborative effort between NHB museums, heritage institutions and community galleries, and local shop owners in their respective precincts to strengthen partnerships with communities and raise awareness of and foster deeper appreciation for heritage in everyday spaces. 
The scheme allows NHB to work closely with local shop owners with at least 30 years of history in selected precincts to co-create â€œmini museumsâ€ that showcase the history and heritage of their respective businesses and trades. Located on site, these galleries will display historical documents, photographs and artefacts that tell the stories of these shops.
On top of providing funding, curatorial support and assistance in fabricating the showcases, NHB will also work with local shop owners to develop programmes such as talks, tours and workshops, and provide opportunities to participate in key NHB events such as the Singapore Heritage Festival and the respective CultureFests of the heritage institutions within their precincts.

Pastries filled with history: Loong Fatt Tau Sar Piah
There is always a long queue at Loong Fatt as people line up for its signature tau sar piah, a traditional flaky pastry filled with mung bean (also known as green bean) paste. However, this landmark shop, which is said to be the oldest surviving traditional kopitiam (coffee shop) at Balestier Road, had its beginnings as a Western-style bakery in 1948.
Loong Fatt's founder, Lee Wang Long (1922-2018), arrived in Singapore from Hainan, China, and first worked as a housekeeper, where he learned to bake English-style cream puffs and other sweet confections. In 1948, he opened a bakery cum kopitiam in this single-storey shop which flourished in the 1950s and 1960s. When business declined in the 1970s, Loong Fatt turned to making tau sar piah.
Today, Lee's family continues to run Loong Fatt, where a team of bakers prepare 3,000-4,000 tau sar piah every day. The exact recipe is a secret, but according to Mdm Loo Suan Mui, who has worked at Loong Fatt since the 1970s, high-quality butter is added to produce a crispier crust, which differs from the softer crust of tau sar piah made in the traditional Teochew style.
The shop has been renovated a few times over the years, but its original green and white wall tiles as well as some of the wooden benches and tables have been retained. Tradition, it seems, is never out of style at Loong Fatt, which still draws in the crowds who come for a hearty meal and often leave with a box or more of tau sar piah fresh from its ovens.
These metal cups were formerly used to make butter cakes.

From market stall to restaurant: Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice
For more than 25 years, people have flocked to this corner shop to dine on succulent chicken and fragrant rice, spiced with hand ground ginger and a homemade garlic-chilli dip. However, few may be aware that Loy Kee has been selling traditional Hainanese chicken rice in the Balestier area since 1953.
Loy Kee's founder, Loy Nie In (1920-2007), came to Singapore from Hainan in the 1940s and his wife, Qua Tee, joined him in Singapore subsequently. In 1953, the Loys opened a little stall selling Hainanese chicken rice as well as chicken and pork porridge at Rayman Market (now Whampoa Makan Place), near a newly built Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) housing estate called Rayman Estate.
Business was good but it was backbreaking work for the Loy family. James Loy, the Loys' youngest son, recalled that his parents would often sleep over in the market stall as they needed to boil porridge and prepare chicken for residents wanting a hearty breakfast early in the morning. The Loys continued to do well in the 1970s, when Rayman Estate was redeveloped into a Housing & Development Board estate.
In the 1980s, the Loys retired and handed down their business to their children. Today, Loy Sai Hong, their elder son, continues to run the family's chicken rice stall at Whampoa Makan Place. Meanwhile, James, the younger son, took over this former kopitiam (coffee shop) and converted it into Loy Kee Best Chicken Rice in 1994.
Loy Nie In and Qua Tee used these choppers to portion out chicken for their customers. The larger chopper (below) was used by Loy, while the smaller chopper was used by his wife. 
Taste of the â€œSouth Seaâ€: Lam Yeo Coffee Powder Factory
Since 1960, when Tan Thian Kang (1912-2008) opened this shop, fans of good local coffee have been making a beeline for Lam Yeo's coffee beans. â€œLam Yeoâ€ is a Hokkien dialect term for â€œNanyangâ€ or â€œSouth Seaâ€, which refers to Southeast Asia. Tan chose to name his shop after this evocative term, as he had worked as an assistant editor at Nanyang Siang Pau, a prominent Chinese-language newspaper, in the 1950s.
Tan's move from newsprint to coffee powder began in 1959, after a brief stint as a salesman for a coffee factory. He started off hawking handpicked coffee beans door to door from the back of a van. As his business grew, Tan and his wife Lim Chok Tee set up shop in 1960 as Lam Yeo Coffee Powder Factory.
During its early years, Lam Yeo's shopfront offered 10 signature blends of coffee powder that were freshly ground and packed for walk-in buyers or delivered to kopitiams (coffee shops) all over the island. Tan also scoured the region for the finest coffee beans, roasting them with painstaking care and blending the results to create brews that won over fans.
Today, Tan's descendants still serve up the shop's legacy blends favoured by their long-time customers. However, Lam Yeo has also kept up with the times, and now offers gourmet blends from countries such as Brazil, Ethiopia and Colombia, which have helped the shop win over a new generation of coffee lovers.
This small metal scoop is used by Benny Tan, the founder's grandson, to measure and portion out coffee beans for walk-in customers.
Toast to tradition: Sweetlands Bread & Bakery
In the 1970s, there were nearly 200 traditional bakeries all over Singapore but today, less than 10 such bakeries remain. Sweetlands Bread & Bakery, which first opened in the 1960s, is one such bakery. It was originally known as Kim Keat Bakery, and supplied loaves to kopitiams (coffee shops) along Balestier Road and beyond.
When the original owners retired in 2001, the bakery was taken over by Ng Yek Heng (b. 1956), who renamed it Sweetlands. Under Ng's management, the bakery expanded its clientele to include new food courts and modern cafÃ©s. The bakery produces an estimated 1,200 pieces of bread, including traditional loaves, baguettes and buns, daily.
The shop floor of the bakery is a hive of activity. The bakers must knead the dough thoroughly so that the flour and yeast are evenly distributed. Before baking, they grease the baking pans properly to ensure that the dough does not stick to the pans. They then place the pans into a large rotating oven, and carefully slice off the brown â€œskinâ€ (hard crust) of each loaf after it emerges from the oven.
Today, Sweetlands Bread & Bakery is in the hands of a third owner, who took over the business following Ng's retirement. Packaged sliced bread manufactured in large factories may dominate the market today but Sweetlands' ability to sustain itself is proof indeed that people still enjoy their kaya toast made the traditional way.
These metal pans are used for baking traditional bread loaves and each pan can contain an estimated 800-900 grams of well-kneaded dough. 
A peek into the past: Lim Kay Khee Optical and Contact Lens Centre
Lim Kay Khee Optical and Contact Lens Centre is one of the oldest optical shops in Singapore with a history that goes back to the 1920s. The shop's founder, Lim Kay Khee (1913-1988), came to Singapore from China at the tender age of nine, and worked as an apprentice at a Shanghainese optical shop where he acquired the skills of a master spectacle maker.
During World War II, Lim's employers were killed, but he managed to escape to a house in Tai Gin Road with a set of optical equipment and technical manuals. These tools, coupled with Lim's skills, proved to be a lifeline. A Japanese soldier had ordered a friend of Lim to procure a pair of glasses. Fearing for his life, this friend turned to Lim, who was able to craft a set that satisfied the soldier and saved both men from harm.
In 1946, after World War II ended, Lim set up Great China Trading Company, a wholesale business that imported spectacle frames and other optical products. The company was originally based at 383 Balestier Road, but in 1960, the business relocated to this shophouse. The shop was given its present name in the 1970s, when contact lenses were added to its offerings.
Today, Lim's children, who are internationally certified optometrists, continue to run the family's two optical shops here and at Peninsula Plaza. Eyewear styles may change with the times, but this shop, with its original mosaic floor tiles and well-used visual charts and optical tools, still offers customers a peek into the past as the Lims continue a family trade that began more than 70 years ago.

Deep roots of a sweet street favourite: Bhai Sarbat Singapore
Sweet and spiced with ginger, teh sarabat (also known as teh halia) has long been a familiar, simple pleasure to quench one's thirst on a hot day. Bhai Sarbat has been offering teh sarabat and other local favourites to patrons since the 1950s when the beverage business was started by a migrant from India known colloquially as Firuz.
First operating as a becak (â€œcycle rickshawâ€ in Malay) stall, Bhai Sarbat settled into a shophouse in the 1970s. When current owner Mohammad Asgar bought over the business in 2018, he named the shop Bhai Sarbat (â€œBrother Sarbatâ€ in Hindi and Urdu) after overhearing a customer referring to its colloquial name.
The shop's success is built on the popularity of teh tarik and teh sarabat, both pulled tea drinks with the latter usually including a ginger extract. In Arabic, Persian and Indian cultures, sharbat, from which sarabat is derived, is generally understood to be a sweet, usually syrup-based drink. However, the term was also adopted for pulled ginger tea in Singapore and Malaysia.
Teh sarabat and teh tarik are made with black tea and condensed milk, and Bhai Sarbat's tea masters demonstrate their individual flair using different pulling techniques. Pulled between two mugs, the varying techniques and lengths of the pull subtly change the temperature and taste of the tea while producing a frothy top layer.
To cater to evolving tastes, Asgar has expanded the drinks menu from 12 to more than 120 drinks, and roped in his son Zaki as a next-generation tea master. Today, a steady flow of new as well as regular customers continues to patronise the shop.

Attar through the generations: Jamal Kazura Aromatics
Since 1933, Jamal Kazura Aromatics has concocted an extensive assortment of perfumes encompassing a diverse variety of scents. The business was founded as Kazura Company by Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff, who had migrated to Singapore from South India via the Riau Islands.
Hanifa's first shop was located at 728 North Bridge Road, and in the early years, he sold a variety of items, including books, gemstones, apparel and perfumes. Many of his customers were pilgrims on the Haj and congregants at the nearby Masjid Sultan.
After taking over the business in the mid-1970s, the founder's son Mohamed Jamal bin Mohamed Hanifa renamed the business as Jamal Kazura Aromatics and focused on selling perfumes, essential oils and incense. The business also began specialising in non-alcoholic perfumes known as attar in Arabic. For centuries, attar has been a high-prestige item in Islamic communities worldwide, with some Muslims applying scents on themselves before prayers.
Using essential oils such as saffron, sandalwood and frankincense, Jamal blends and creates numerous distinctive perfumes, including the bestsellers â€œSymphonyâ€ and â€œSultanâ€. Jamal's children, now third-generation managers of the business, recall going to school wearing multifarious scents as their father would test his perfumes on them.
From the 1990s, the business broadened its perfume range to cater to evolving tastes and a multi-ethnic, multi-religious clientele, which includes Buddhists purchasing sandalwood incense and Christians buying frankincense. In 2009, the founder's grandson Johari Kazura opened Sifr Aromatics at 42 Arab Street, offering more bespoke perfumes and sustaining his family's heritage of craft and innovation.

Heritage food, community and custom: Rumah Makan Minang
Established in the early 1980s, Rumah Makan Minang is one of the successors of the original Sabar Menanti restaurant. Growing up and working in the family-run Sabar Menanti stall, owner Zulbaidah binte Marlian had firsthand experience of how her mother Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu exemplified the independent, strong female figures esteemed in Minangkabau culture. Following in her footsteps, Zulbaidah founded her own nasi padang establishment, Rumah Makan Minang, with her husband Mohamed Zin bin Harun.
One of the centrepieces of nasi padang cuisine is beef rendang, a slow-cooked dish of beef, spices and coconut which originated from the Minangkabau people but has also been adapted in other regional cuisines. Rumah Makan Minang's rendang is faithful to the drier, caramelised style served in Sungai Limau, West Sumatra, where Rosemah was born.
The restaurant's other popular dishes are ayam belado hijau (fried chicken with signature green sambal belado) and paru belado merah (fried cow lung with red sambal belado), whose main ingredients are cooked with sambal belado, a coarse chilli paste that is widely used in Minangkabau cuisine. Another characteristic of Minangkabau cuisine is the use of santan (coconut milk) and fresh grated coconut instead of kerisik (fried coconut paste).
The above-mentioned cooking techniques and recipes at Rumah Makan Minang bear the imprint of three generations, from Hajjah Rosemah and Haji Marlian to Zulbaidah and Zin, and their children, Hazmi, Syahidah, Ariff and Nazri. Under their charge, the business opened a central kitchen to ensure the consistency and quality of their food, and added a new branch at Tampines in 2017. Their rendang has also been showcased on Shangri-La Hotel's heritage menu, even as its recipe remains a family secret.
This photograph shows the previous location of Rumah Makan Minang, which occupied three shophouse units on Bussorah Street in October 1993.
A nasi padang legacy: Sabar Menanti
Continuing the legacy of one of the most well-known nasi padang restaurants in Singapore, this restaurant was founded as Sabar Menanti II in 1997 by Maryulis Bagindor binte Marlian, the eldest daughter of the original restaurant's founders Haji Marlian bin Athar and Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu.
Sabar Menanti, the original establishment, started as an unnamed street stall in the 1920s. It was once colloquially known as nasi padang batu nisan (â€œtombstone nasi padangâ€ in Malay) as it was located next to a prominent tombstone maker. The name Sabar Menanti, which means â€œwait patientlyâ€ in Malay, only came about in the 1960s when Haji Marlian's friend gifted him a signboard from a previous restaurant.
In her younger days, Maryulis and her siblings would gather firewood for the stoves and collect water from a public standpipe near Sultan Gate while their parents cooked. By the 1990s, the business had expanded into six restaurants in Kampong Gelam, each helmed by second generation members of the Marlian family.
Priding itself on preserving traditional flavours, Sabar Menanti's cuisine expresses its Minangkabau heritage through techniques such as charcoal grilling and the use of traditional spices and ingredients. These methods are apparent in their rendang and other favourites including ikan bakar (grilled fish) and ayam gulai (Padang-style chicken curry).
Today, Sabar Menanti remains true to its heritage, even as the restaurant seeks to appeal to a new generation of customers. When Maryulis' son Mohamad Iszahar Tambunan took over, he renamed the restaurant to reflect that it is the sole Sabar Menanti in operation, and has updated the restaurant's decor and added food delivery options. The other members of the family, meanwhile, continue to use traditional cooking techniques and recipes for the restaurant's array of nasi padang dishes.
This photograph from 1966 shows the family behind the original Sabar Menanti. The business' co-founder, Rosemah Mailu, is seated third from left.
The house of small things: Sin Hin Chuan Kee
Sin Hin Chuan Kee's proprietors often describe the business as having grown together with generations of its customers. Founded in 1965 by Ng Koon Teng, an immigrant from Quanzhou, China, this family-run haberdashery and trading business boomed in part due to the import and export opportunities that Singapore enjoyed as a trading hub.
After working in a trading firm, Ng established Sin Hin Chuan Kee Trading Co in a shop at 47 Clyde Street, with his family roots reflected in the name â€œChuan Keeâ€, which translates to â€œremembering Quan(zhou)â€ in Hokkien. Capitalising on Singapore's position as an entrepot and trading hub, Ng sold thread, lace, buttons and assorted accessories to factories, tailors and traders. When Clyde Street underwent redevelopment in the 1970s, the shop relocated to Kampong Gelam.
Displaying an entrepreneurial zeal, Ng and his family sought out suppliers throughout Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, and sourced for products such as Flying Wheel sewing thread from China and later YKK zippers from Japan, both of which became cornerstones of their distribution business. Ng's successors, including sons Ng Cheow Kok, Ng Cheow Poh and their siblings expanded the business by finding new customers in India, Thailand, Malaysia and other countries.
During the economic boom in the 1970s and 1980s, traders from various countries could be seen queuing up outside the shop and paying cash for large orders of YKK zippers and other accessories. The shop's staff would then transport the goods to Boat Quay to be shipped across the world, or delivered to the buyers at various locations.
From the 2000s, the third generation of the Ng family, including the founder's grandsons Adrian Ng and Kenny Ng, grew the retail arm of their business and established an online storefront. These adaptations, among others, have helped sustain Sin Hin Chuan Kee and keep the business relevant to a new generation of customers.

From Kampong Gelam to the Haj: V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons
Since 1935, V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons has provided hundreds of thousands of Muslims with accessories that are useful for the Haj pilgrimage. The business was founded by Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, a Tiruchirappalli, India-born migrant who arrived in Singapore from Rangoon, Myanmar.
Varusai Mohamed started his entrepreneurial career selling socks in Kampong Gelam, before setting up a factory at the nearby Crawford Court area to manufacture and sell steel baggage trunks and umbrellas. The product that the business is best known for, however, is a sturdy, practical belt used by Haj travellers, known colloquially in Malay as tali pinggang haji or simply as a green belt.
While on the Haj, pilgrims wear unstitched and seamless robes known as ihram, which are meant to signify the equality of all Muslims before God. During his own Haj journey, Varusai Mohamed noticed that many pilgrims were tying their money pouches and other possessions to their ihram using makeshift methods, and he was inspired to design a belt to carry money and necessities.
In 1935, Varusai Mohamed patented the Makkah Zam Zam Belt in the United Kingdom and proceeded to manufacture the belt in Singapore using quality components. At its peak, some 60,000 belts were exported to the Middle East each year. Varusai Mohamed's customers for the belts and other Haj accessories included pilgrims from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, who made a stop at the Kampong Gelam area on their way to and from the Haj.
The second and third generations of this family-run business maintained its longstanding presence in Kampong Gelam, and have expanded the range of goods available to include ihram clothing, incense and perfumes among others. The latter two products in particular have helped Varusai Mohamed attract a multi-cultural customer base.
This is a photograph of Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, the founder of the business. Hailing from Tiruchirappalli in India, he arrived in Singapore in 1924.
A tradition of charcoal and spices: Warong Nasi Pariaman
The Minangkabau tradition of merantau, or customary migration, has been linked to the widespread popularity of beef rendang throughout Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. A flavourful, slow-cooked dish that serves as a reminder of home for the Minangkabau migrants, rendang and other nasi padang favourites have been mainstays here at Warong Nasi Pariaman for decades.
Established by Isrin bin Ibrahim and his wife Rosna binte Zainal Abidin, Warong Nasi Pariaman has been serving nasi padang (also known as Minang cuisine) from this North Bridge Road shop since 1948. Having migrated to Singapore in the 1940s, Isrin and his family operated from a street stall before renting a shophouse and naming their business after their hometown of Pariaman, a city in West Sumatra, Indonesia.
The patriarch Isrin's insistence on quality ingredients, cooking methods and presentation continues to guide Warong Nasi Pariaman's cuisine in the 21st century. Under the charge of the founder's children Sudirman, Jumrin, Munaf and Nasrin, the restaurant specialises in nasi padang dishes including beef rendang (beef stew), ayam bakar (grilled chicken) and gulai nangka (jackfruit curry).
The rendang and ayam bakar here reflect the traditional cooking techniques of Minangkabau culture, with the former slow-cooked over a charcoal fire, in a stew that includes rempah (spice paste), coconut milk, onions, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves. The latter dish, ayam bakar, is cooked in a coconut gravy before being charcoal grilled, and both dishes possess a subtle smoky flavour that many customers love.
In the 21st century, Isrin's granddaughter Yanty Sulastry Emrin represents the third generation of the family working in the business. Together with other longstanding nasi padang establishments in Kampong Gelam, Warong Nasi Pariaman continues to keep Minangkabau culinary traditions alive in the area.
This photograph shows a pushcart used in the 1980s when rendang and other nasi padang dishes were cooked at the family home at the nearby Bussorah Street, before being transported to the shop.

Pastri yang berisi tentang sejarah: Tau Sar Piah Loong Fatt
Sering ada barisan panjang di Loong Fatt dengan orang ramai beratur untuk mendapatkan tau sar piah yang terkenal, pastri tradisional yang diisi dengan pes kacang hijau. Namun, kedai mercu tanda ini, yang dikatakan sebagai kopitiam (kedai kopi) tradisional tertua yang masih bertakat di Balestier Road, telah bermula sebagai kedai roti ala Barat pada tahun 1948.
Pengasas Loong Fatt, Lee Wang Long (1922-2018), tiba di Singapura dari Hainan, China, dan mulanya bekerja sebagai pembantu rumah, di mana beliau belajar membakar paf krim ala Inggeris dan manisan yang lain. Pada tahun 1948, beliau membuka kedai roti dan kopitiam di kedai satu tingkat ini yang berkembang pada tahun 1950-an dan 1960-an. Apabila perniagaan merosot pada tahun 1970-an, Loong Fatt beralih kepada pembuatan tau sar piah.
Hari ini, keluarga Lee terus mengendalikan Loong Fatt, di mana sepasukan tukang roti menyediakan 3,000-4,000 tau sar piah setiap hari. Resipi yang tepat adalah rahsia, tetapi menurut Cik Loo Suan Mui, yang telah bekerja di Loong Fatt sejak tahun 1970-an, mentega bermutu tinggi ditambahkan untuk menghasilkan kerak yang lebih rangup. Ini berbeza daripada kerak lebih lembut pada tau sar piah yang dibuat menurut gaya Teochew tradisional.
Kedai ini telah diubah elok beberapa kali sepanjang bertahun-tahun, tetapi jubin dinding hijau dan putih asalnya serta beberapa bangku dan meja kayu telah dikekalkan. Nampaknya, tradisi tidak pernah ketinggalan zaman di Loong Fatt. Ia masih menarik perhatian orang ramai yang datang untuk menikmati makanan yang lazat dan sering beredar dengan sebuah kotak atau lebih mengandungi tau sar piah segar dari ketuharnya.
Cawan logam ini dulu digunakan untuk membuat kek mentega.

Daripada gerai di pasar kepada restoran: Nasi Ayam Terbaik Loy Kee
Selama lebih daripada 25 tahun, ramai orang datang berduyun-duyun ke kedai sudut ini untuk menikmati ayam lazat dan nasi harum, dibumbui dengan halia giling tangan serta cecahan cili dan bawang putih buatan sendiri. Namun, mungkin tidak ramai yang menyedari bahawa Loy Kee telah menjual nasi ayam tradisional Hainan di daerah Balestier sejak tahun 1953.
Pengasas Loy Kee, Loy Nie In (1920-2007), datang ke Singapura dari Hainan pada tahun 1940-an dan isterinya, Qua Tee, menyertainya di Singapura kemudian. Pada tahun 1953, pasangan Loy itu membuka gerai kecil yang menjual nasi ayam Hainan serta bubur ayam dan daging babi di Pasar Rayman (kini Tempat Makan Whampoa), berhampiran Estet Rayman, sebuah kawasan perumahan Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) yang baru dibina.
Perniagaan begitu baik tetapi kerjanya menjerihkan bagi pasangan Loy. James Loy, anak bongsu Loy, teringat bahawa ibu bapanya sering tidur di gerai pasar kerana mereka perlu memasak bubur dan menyediakan ayam untuk penduduk yang inginkan sarapan pagi yang enak. Pasangan Loy terus berniaga dengan baik pada tahun 1970-an apabila Estet Rayman dibangunkan semula menjadi estet Lembaga Perumahan & Pembangunan.
Pada tahun 1980-an, pasangan Loy bersara dan menyerahkan perniagaan mereka kepada anak-anak mereka. Hari ini, Loy Sai Hong, anak sulung mereka, terus mengusahakan warung nasi ayam keluarga itu di Tempat Makan Whampoa. Sementara itu, James, anak lelaki yang lebih muda, mengambil alih bekas kopitiam (kedai kopi) ini dan mengubahnya menjadi Nasi Ayam Terbaik Loy Kee pada tahun 1994.
Loy Nie In dan Qua Tee menggunakan pisau pemotong daging ini untuk membahagi ayam untuk pelanggan mereka. Pisau yang lebih besar (di bawah) digunakan oleh Loy, sementara pisau yang lebih kecil digunakan oleh isterinya.
Rasa â€œLaut Selatanâ€: Kilang Serbuk Kopi Lam Yeo
Sejak tahun 1960, ketika Tan Thian Kang (1912-2008) membuka kedai ini, penggemar kopi tempatan yang baik telah terus sahaja memilih biji kopi Lam Yeo. ""Lam Yeo"" ialah istilah dialek Hokkien untuk ""Nanyang"" atau ""Laut Selatan"", yang merujuk kepada Asia Tenggara. Tan menamakan kedainya dengan istilah yang menggugah ini kerana beliau pernah bekerja sebagai penolong editor di Nanyang Siang Pau, sebuah akhbar berbahasa Cina yang terkenal pada tahun 1950-an.
Peralihan Tan daripada kertas akhbar kepada serbuk kopi bermula pada tahun 1959, selepas bertugas seketika sebagai jurujual bagi sebuah kilang kopi. Beliau mula menjaja biji kopi yang dipilih sendiri dari pintu ke pintu dari belakang sebuah van. Sedang perniagaannya berkembang, Tan dan isterinya Lim Chok Tee menubuhkan kedai pada tahun 1960 sebagai Kilang Serbuk Kopi Lam Yeo.
Pada tahun-tahun awalnya, kedai Lam Yeo menawarkan 10 campuran serbuk kopi khas yang baru dikisar dan dibungkus untuk pembeli yang datang ke kedainya atau dihantar ke kopitiam (kedai kopi) di serata pulau. Tan juga menjelajahi rantau ini untuk mendapatkan biji kopi terbaik, memanggangnya dengan penuh berhati-hati dan mengadunkan hasilnya untuk menghasilkan minuman yang memikat hati peminat.
Hari ini, keturunan Tan masih menghasilkan campuran warisan kedai yang disukai oleh pelanggan lama mereka. Bagaimanapun, Lam Yeo juga mengikuti perkembangan zaman, dan kini menawarkan campuran â€˜gourmet' dari negara-negara seperti Brazil, Ethiopia dan Colombia, yang telah membantu kedai ini memikat hati generasi baru penggemar kopi.
Senduk logam kecil ini digunakan oleh Benny Tan, cucu pengasas, untuk menyukat dan membahagi biji kopi untuk pelanggan yang datang ke kedai.
Sanjungan kepada tradisi: Kedai Roti dan Konfeksi Sweetlands
Pada tahun 1970-an, terdapat hampir 200 kedai roti tradisional di seluruh Singapura tetapi hari ini, hanya tinggal kurang daripada 10 kedai roti seperti itu. Kedai Roti dan Konfeksi Sweetlands, yang pertama kali dibuka pada tahun 1960-an, ialah salah satu kedai roti seperti itu. Ia asalnya dikenali sebagai Kedai Roti Kim Keat, dan membekalkan roti kepada kopitiam (kedai kopi) di sepanjang Balestier Road dan kawasan di luarnya.
Ketika pemilik asalnya bersara pada tahun 2001, kedai roti itu diambil alih oleh Ng Yek Heng (lahir 1956) yang mengubah namanya menjadi Sweetlands. Di bawah pengurusan Ng, kedai roti itu mengembangkan pelanggannya untuk merangkumi medan selera baru dan kafe moden. Kedai roti itu menghasilkan kira-kira 1,200 bantal roti, termasuk roti tradisional, roti perancis dan ban setiap hari.
Kedai roti itu begitu penuh sesak dan sibuk. Pembakar roti mesti menguli adunan sehingga tepung dan ragi sebati. Sebelum membakar, mereka mengoles minyak pada acuan dengan betul untuk memastikan adunan tidak melekat pada acuan. Mereka kemudian meletakkan acuan ke dalam ketuhar berputar besar, dan memotong dengan teliti ""kulit"" berwarna coklat (kerak keras) setiap bantal roti setelah ia dikeluarkan dari ketuhar.
Hari ini, Kedai Roti dan Konfeksi Sweetlands berada dalam tangan pemilik ketiga yang mengambil alih perniagaan berikutan persaraan Ng. Roti yang dipotong dan berbungkus yang dihasilkan di kilang-kilang besar mungkin menguasai pasaran hari ini tetapi keupayaan Sweetlands untuk terus bertahan menjadi bukti bahawa orang ramai masih menikmati roti bakar kaya mereka yang dihasilkan dengan cara tradisional.
Acuan logam ini digunakan untuk membakar roti tradisional dan setiap acuan boleh berisi kira-kira 800-900 gram adunan yang diuli dengan baik.
Mengintai kepada masa lalu: Pusat Kaca Mata dan Kanta Lekap Lim Kay Khee
Pusat Kaca Mata dan Kanta Lekap Lim Kay Khee ialah salah satu kedai kaca mata tertua di Singapura dengan sejarah yang bermula pada tahun 1920-an. Pengasas kedai, Lim Kay Khee (1913-1988), datang ke Singapura dari China pada usia sembilan tahun dan bekerja sebagai perantis di sebuah kedai kaca mata orang Shanghai di mana beliau memperoleh kemahiran seorang pembuat kaca mata yang ulung.
Semasa Perang Dunia II, majikan Lim telah terbunuh, tetapi beliau berjaya melarikan diri ke sebuah rumah di Tai Gin Road dengan satu set peralatan kaca mata dan buku panduan teknikal. Alat-alat ini, ditambah dengan kemahiran Lim, terbukti menjadi penyelamat. Seorang askar Jepun telah memerintahkan seorang rakan Lim supaya membelikan sepasang kaca mata. Takut nyawanya terancam, rakan ini berpaling kepada Lim, yang dapat membuat satu set yang memuaskan hati askar itu dan menyelamatkan kedua-dua lelaki itu daripada bahaya.
Pada tahun 1946, setelah Perang Dunia II berakhir, Lim menubuhkan Syarikat Perdagangan Great China, sebuah perniagaan borong yang mengimport bingkai kaca mata dan produk optik lain. Syarikat itu pada awalnya berpusat di 383 Balestier Road, tetapi pada tahun 1960, perniagaan itu berpindah ke rumah kedai ini. Pada tahun 1970-an, kedai itu diberikan nama yang ada sekarang ketika kanta lekap ditambah kepada perkhidmatannya.
Hari ini, anak-anak Lim, yang merupakan optometris diperakui di peringkat antarabangsa, terus mengendalikan dua kedai kaca mata keluarga itu di sini dan di Peninsula Plaza. Gaya kaca mata mungkin berubah mengikut zaman, tetapi kedai ini, dengan jubin lantai mozek aslinya dan carta visual dan alat kaca mata yang sudah lama digunakan, masih menawarkan pelanggan pengintaian kepada masa lalu sedang keluarga Lim meneruskan perniagaan keluarga yang bermula lebih daripada 70 tahun lalu.
Pada tahun 1960-an, ketika keupayaan membaca dan menulis orang dewasa berada di bawah 60 peratus, carta dengan piktogram ini biasanya digunakan untuk menguji ketajaman visual orang dewasa dan juga kanak-kanak yang tidak dapat membaca.

Akar umbi manisan kegemaran jalanan: Bhai Sarbat Singapura
Manis dan diperisakan dengan halia, sarabat (juga dikenali sebagai teh halia) telah lama menjadi kegemaran lumrah untuk menghilangkan dahaga pada hari yang panas. Bhai Sarbat telah menjual sarabat dan kegemaran tempatan lainnya kepada pelanggan sejak tahun 1950-an semasa perniagaan minuman dimulakan oleh seorang pendatang dari India yang dikenali sebagai Firuz.
Pertama kali berniaga sebagai gerai beca, Bhai Sarbat akhirnya beroperasi di sebuah rumah kedai pada tahun 1970-an. Semasa pemilik sekarang Mohammad Asgar membeli perniagaan tersebut pada tahun 2018, dia menamakan kedai itu Bhai Sarbat (""Saudara Sarbat"" dalam bahasa Hindi dan Urdu) setelah mendengar pelanggan merujuk kepada nama julukannya.
Kejayaan kedai ini dibina berdasarkan populariti teh sarbat dan teh tarik biasa, teh sarbat adalah campuran teh dan pati halia. Dalam budaya Arab, Parsi dan India, sharbat, dari mana sarabat berasal, umumnya difahami sebagai minuman manis, biasanya berasaskan sirap. Namun, istilah ini juga digunakan untuk teh halia yang ditarik di Singapura dan Malaysia.
Teh sarabat dan teh tarik dibuat dengan teh hitam dan susu pekat, dan pakar pembuat teh Bhai Sarbat menunjukkan bakat masing-masing menggunakan teknik yang berbeza. Ditarik di antara dua koleh, teknik dan panjang tarikan yang berbeza-beza secara halus mengubah suhu dan rasa teh sambil menghasilkan lapisan atas yang berbuih.
Untuk memenuhi selera yang sentiasa berubah-rubah, Asgar telah memperluas menu minuman dari 12 hingga lebih dari 120 minuman, dan mejadikan anaknya Zaki sebagai pakar teh generasi seterusnya. Hari ini, aliran pelanggan baru dan tetap berterusan mengunjungi kedai itu.
Penapis teh kain nilon digunakan untuk menyaring teh atau serbuk kopi untuk minuman di Bhai Sarbat, termasuk teh halia dan teh tarik yang terkenal.
Attar turun temurun: Aromatik Jamal Kazura
Sejak tahun 1933, Jamal Kazura Aromatics telah membuat banyak jenis minyak wangi yang merangkumi berbagai aroma. Perniagaan ini diasaskan sebagai Syarikat Kazura oleh Mohamed Hanifa bin Mohamed Shariff, yang telah berhijrah ke Singapura dari India Selatan melalui Kepulauan Riau.
Kedai pertama Hanifa terletak di 728 North Bridge Road, dan pada tahun-tahun awalnya, dia menjual berbagai barang, termasuk buku, batu permata, pakaian dan minyak wangi. Ramai pelanggannya bakal jemaah haji dan berhimpun di Masjid Sultan yang berdekatan.
Setelah mengambil alih perniagaan ini pada pertengahan tahun 1970-an, anak pengasasnya Mohamed Jamal bin Mohamed Hanifa menamakan semula perniagaan itu sebagai Jamal Kazura Aromatics dan memberi tumpuan kepada penjualan minyak wangi, minyak pati dan setanggi. Perniagaan kemudian mengkhususkan penjualan minyak wangi tanpa alkohol yang dikenali sebagai attar dalam bahasa Arab. Berabad-abad lamanya, attar mempunyai kedudukan tinggi dalam masyarakat Islam di seluruh dunia, dengan sebilangan umat Islam memakai wangian pada diri mereka sebelum solat.
Dengan menggunakan minyak pati seperti safron, cendana dan setanggi, Jamal mengadun dan mencipta sebilangan minyak wangi khas, termasuk yang paling laris ""Symphony"" dan ""Sultan"". Anak-anak Jamal, yang kini merupakan pengurus generasi ketiga perniagaan, masih ingat mereka pergi ke sekolah dengan wangian berbagai aroma kerana bapa mereka akan menguji minyak wangi ke atas mereka.
Mulai tahun 1990-an, perniagaan itu memperluaskan rangkaian jenis-jenis minyak wangi untuk memenuhi selera yang sentiasa berkembang dan pelanggan-pelanggan dari  berbagai etnik, agama, termasuk penganut Buddha membeli dupa cendana dan orang Kristian membeli setanggi. Pada tahun 2009, cucu pengasas Johari Kazura membuka Sifr Aromatics di 42 Arab Street, menawarkan lebih banyak rangkaian minyak wangi khusus dan mengekalkan seni warisan dan inovasi keluarganya.

Makanan warisan, masyarakat dan adat: Rumah Makan Minang
Didirikan pada awal 1980-an, Rumah Makan Minang adalah salah satu pewaris restoran Sabar Menanti yang asal. Membesar dan bekerja di gerai Sabar Menanti yang dikendalikan oleh keluarga, pemilik Zulbaidah binte Marlian mempunyai pengalaman langsung tentang bagaimana ibunya Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu, contoh berdikari, tokoh wanita yang dihormati dalam budaya Minangkabau. Mengikuti jejak ibunya, Zulbaidah mengasaskan rumah nasi padang sendiri, iaitu Rumah Makan Minang, bersama suaminya Mohamed Zin bin Harun.
Salah satu sajian utama nasi padang adalah rendang iaitu masakan daging lembu, rempah dan kelapa yang direnih lama yang berasal dari orang Minangkabau tetapi juga telah disesuaikan dengan masakan dari daerah lain. Rendang Rumah Makan Minang mengekalkan gaya masakan lebih kering dan gelap disajikan di Sungai Limau, Sumatera Barat, tempat Rosemah dilahirkan.
Hidangan popular lain di restoran itu adalah ayam belado hijau (ayam goreng dengan sambal belado hijau khas) dan paru belado merah (paru-paru lembu goreng dengan sambal belado merah), yang bahan utamanya dimasak dengan sambal belado, bumbu cili kasar yang banyak digunakan dalam masakan Minangkabau. Ciri khas masakan Minangkabau adalah penggunaan santan dan kelapa parut segar dan bukannya kerisik.
Teknik memasak dan resipi Rumah Makan Minang yang disebutkan di atas, membawa pengalaman turun temurun tiga generasi, dari Hajjah Rosemah dan Haji Marlian hingga Zulbaidah dan Zin, dan anak-anak mereka, Hazmi, Syahidah, Ariff dan Nazri. Di bawah pengurusan mereka, perniagaan itu membuka dapur pusat untuk memastikan keselarasan dan mutu  makanan mereka, dan menambahkan cabang baru di Tampines pada tahun 2017. Rendang mereka juga telah dipamerkan di menu warisan Shangri-La Hotel, meskipun resipinya tetap menjadi rahsia keluarga.
Gambar ini menunjukkan lokasi Rumah Makan Minang sebelumnya, yang menduduki tiga unit rumah kedai di Bussorah Street pada bulan Oktober 1993.
Legasi nasi padang: Sabar Menanti
Meneruskan legasi salah satu restoran nasi padang yang paling terkenal di Singapura, restoran ini diasaskan sebagai Sabar Menanti II pada tahun 1997 oleh Maryulis Bagindor binte Marlian, puteri sulung pengasas asal restoran, Haji Marlian bin Athar dan Hajjah Rosemah binte Mailu.
Sabar Menanti, nama asal, bermula sebagai gerai jalanan yang tidak disebutkan namanya pada tahun 1920-an. Dulunya dikenali sebagai nasi padang batu nisan kerana terletak di sebelah pembuat batu nisan yang terkenal. Nama Sabar Menanti, yang bermaksud ""sabar menunggu"" dalam bahasa Melayu, hanya muncul pada tahun 1960-an semasa rakan Haji Marlian memberinya papan tanda dari restoran sebelum itu.
Pada masa usia mudanya, Maryulis dan adik-beradiknya mengumpulkan kayu bakar untuk dapur dan mengambil air dari bekalan air paip awam berhampiran Sultan Gate semasa ibu bapa mereka sedang memasak. Pada tahun 1990-an, perniagaan telah berkembang dengan pembukaan enam restoran di Kampong Gelam, masing-masing dikendalikan oleh anggota generasi kedua keluarga Marlian.
Berbangga dapat mengekalkan rasa tradisional, masakan Sabar Menanti memaparkan warisan Minangkabau melalui teknik seperti bara arang dan penggunaan rempah dan bahan tradisional. Kaedah ini jelas terdapat pada rendang dan kegemaran lain termasuk ikan bakar dan ayam gulai (kari ayam gaya Padang).
Hari ini, Sabar Menanti mengekalkan warisannya, walaupun restoran itu berusaha menarik minat pelanggan generasi baru. Apabila anak Maryulis, Mohamad Iszahar Tambunan mengambil alih, beliau menamakan semula restoran itu untuk menggambarkan bahawa itu adalah Sabar Menanti tunggal yang beroperasi, dan telah memperbarui hiasan restoran dan menambahkan pilihan penghantaran makanan. Sementara itu, anggota keluarga yang lain terus menggunakan teknik memasak tradisional dan resipi untuk hidangan nasi padang restoran.
Gambar pada tahun 1966 ini menunjukkan keluarga di sebalik Sabar Menanti yang asal. Pengasas bersama perniagaan, Rosemah Mailu, duduk ketiga dari kiri.




Rumah barang-barang kecil: Sin Hin Chuan Kee
Pemilik-pemilik Sin Hin Chuan Kee sering menggambarkan perniagaan mereka  berkembang bersama generasi pelanggannya. Ditubuhkan pada tahun 1965 oleh Ng Koon Teng, seorang pendatang dari Quanzhou, China, perniagaan keluarga barang-barang peralatan jahitan berkembang pesat sebahagiannya kerana peluang import dan eksport yang dinikmati oleh Singapura sebagai pusat perdagangan.
Setelah bekerja di sebuah firma perdagangan, Ng menubuhkan Sin Hin Chuan Kee Trading Co di sebuah kedai di 47 Clyde Street, dengan susur galur keluarganya diserlahkan dalam nama ""Chuan Kee"", yang diterjemahkan menjadi ""mengingat Quan (zhou)"" di Hokkien. Dengan memanfaatkan kedudukan Singapura sebagai pusat perdagangan dan perdagangan, Ng menjual benang, renda, kancing dan berbagai jenis aksesori ke kilang, tukang jahit dan para peniaga. Semasa Clyde Street menjalani pembangunan semula pada tahun 1970-an, kedai itu berpindah ke Kampong Gelam.
Mempamerkan semangat keusahawanan, Ng dan keluarganya mencari pembekal di seluruh Asia pada tahun 1960-an dan 1970-an, dan memperoleh produk seperti benang jahit Flying Wheel dari China dan kemudian zip YKK dari Jepun, yang keduanya menjadi tonggak  perniagaan pengedaran mereka. Pengganti Ng, termasuk anak lelaki Ng Cheow Poh, Ng Cheow Kok dan adik beradik mereka mengembangkan perniagaan dengan mencari pelanggan baru di India, Thailand, Malaysia dan negara lain.
Semasa ledakan ekonomi pada tahun 1970-an dan 1980-an, para pedagang dari berbagai negara dapat dilihat beratur di luar kedai dan membayar secara tunai untuk pesanan besar zip YKK dan aksesori lain. Kakitangan kedai kemudian akan mengangkut barang ke Boat Quay untuk dihantar ke seluruh dunia, atau dihantar ke pembeli di berbagai lokasi.
Mulai tahun 2000-an, generasi ketiga keluarga Ng, termasuk cucu pengasas Adrian Ng dan Kenny Ng, mengembangkan cabang perniagaan runcit mereka dan memperkenalkan perniagaan dalam talian. Penyesuaian ini antara lain telah membantu mengekalkan Sin Hin Chuan Kee dan memastikan perniagaan itu terus relevan dengan generasi pelanggan baru.

Dari Kampong Gelam hingga Mengerjakan Haji: V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons
Sejak tahun 1935, V. S. S. Varusai Mohamed & Sons telah menyediakan beratus-ratus ribu umat Islam aksesori yang berguna untuk menunaikan haji. Perniagaan ini diasaskan oleh Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, seorang pendatang kelahiran Tiruchirappalli, India yang tiba di Singapura dari Rangoon, Myanmar.
Varusai Mohamed memulakan kerjaya keusahawanannya dengan menjual sarung kaki di Kampong Gelam, sebelum mendirikan kilang di kawasan Crawford Court yang berdekatan untuk mengeluarkan dan menjual batang bagasi dan payung keluli. Produk yang terkenal dengan perniagaannya, bagaimanapun, adalah tali pinggang praktikal yang kukuh yang digunakan oleh jemaah haji, yang dikenali sebagai tali pinggang haji atau pangilan mudahnya tali pinggang hijau.
Semasa menunaikan haji, jemaah haji memakai jubah tanpa jahitan dan tidak berkelim yang dikenali sebagai ihram, sebagai lambang kesamarataan semua umat Islam di hadapan Tuhan. Semasa beliau mengerjakan haji, Varusai Mohamed melihat ramai jemaah mengikat dompet dan barang-barang lain ke ihram mereka secara sementara, dan mendorong beliau untuk mencipta-reka tali pinggang yang boleh menyimpan wang dan barang keperluan.
Pada tahun 1935, Varusai Mohamed mempatenkan Tali Pingang Zam Zam Makkah di United Kingdom dan meneruskan pembuatan tali pinggang di Singapura dengan menggunakan komponen berkualiti. Pada puncaknya, sekitar 60,000 tali pinggang dieksport ke Timur Tengah setiap tahun. Pelanggan Varusai Mohamed untuk tali pinggang dan aksesori Haji yang lain termasuk jemaah dari Singapura, Malaysia dan Indonesia, yang berhenti di kawasan Kampong Gelam dalam perjalanan pergi-balik Haji.
Generasi kedua dan ketiga dari perniagaan yang dikendalikan keluarga ini terus kekal menjalankan perniagaan di Kampong Gelam, dan telah memperluas rangkaian barang yang tersedia untuk merangkumi pakaian ihram, setanggi dan minyak wangi antara lain. Setanggi dan minyak wangi, khususnya telah membantu Varusai Mohamed menarik pangkalan pelanggan berbagai budaya.
Ini adalah gambar Valanadu Sinnagani Syeda Mohamed Varusai Mohamed, pengasas perniagaan. Berasal dari Tiruchirappalli di India, dia tiba di Singapura pada tahun 1924.
Tradisi rempah dan arang: Warong Nasi Pariaman
Tradisi Minangkabau adat merantau, atau penghijrahan, telah dikaitkan dengan populariti rendang daging lembu di seluruh Indonesia, Singapura dan Malaysia. Hidangan yang dimasak dengan perlahan dan berperisa bagaikan pengubat rindu kampung halaman bagi para pendatang Minangkabau, rendang dan hidangan nasi padang lain telah menjadi makanan utama di Warong Nasi Pariaman selama beberapa dekad.
Ditubuhkan oleh Isrin bin Ibrahim dan isterinya Rosna binte Zainal Abidin, Warong Nasi Pariaman telah menyediakan nasi padang (juga dikenali sebagai masakan Minang) dari kedai North Bridge Road ini sejak tahun 1948. Setelah berhijrah ke Singapura pada tahun 1940-an, Isrin dan keluarganya beroperasi dari sebuah gerai jalan sebelum menyewa rumah kedai dan menamakan perniagaan mereka sempena nama kampung halaman mereka di Pariaman, sebuah kota di Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.
Ketekunan Isrin sebagai ketua keluarga yang mengutamakan bahan-bahan berkualiti, kaedah memasak dan hiasan sajian terus membawa masakan Warong Nasi Pariaman pada abad ke-21. Di bawah jagaan anak-anak pengasas Sudirman, Jumrin, Munaf dan Nasrin, restoran ini mengkhususkan kepada hidangan nasi padang termasuk rendang daging sapi (rendidih daging sapi), ayam bakar dan gulai nangka.
  Rendang dan ayam bakar di sini mencerminkan teknik memasak tradisional budaya Minangkabau, dengan bekas yang dimasak perlahan di atas bara arang, di dalam rendidih yang meliputi rempah (rempah pedas), santan, bawang, serai dan daun limau purut. Hidangan ayam bakar, dimasak dalam santan sebelum dipanggang dengan arang, dan kedua-dua hidangan mempunyai aroma salai yang disukai ramai pelanggan.
  Pada abad ke-21, cucu perempuan Isrin, Yanty Sulastry Emrin mewakili generasi ketiga keluarga yang menguruskan perniagaan. Bersama dengan restoran nasi padang lain yang sudah lama wujud di Kampong Gelam, Warong Nasi Pariaman terus mengekalkan tradisi masakan Minangkabau di kawasan ini.
Gambar ini menunjukkan kereta sorong yang digunakan pada tahun 1980-an semasa rendang dan hidangan nasi padang lain dimasak di rumah keluarga di Bussorah Street yang berdekatan, sebelum diangkut ke kedai.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Urang-Banjar,"TL;DR
This is the digital companion to the exhibition Urang Banjar: Heritage and Culture of the Banjar in Singapore, which focuses on the Banjar community - one of the smallest sub-ethnic Malay communities in Singapore. Members of the community are able to trace their lineage to traders, diamond merchants, businessmen and travellers who arrived in Singapore from South Kalimantan via overland routes in the Malay Peninsula or by sea from as early as the beginning of the 19th century. Navigate their journey through this selection of objects and multimedia content by scrolling down or clicking through the themes on the left.
Introduction
â€˜Haram manyarah waja sampai kaputing' is a basa Banjar idiom which translates as â€˜let not the steel (of a blade) stop short until its very point' and serves as an exhortation for Banjar to undertake all endeavours with determination, to do their best and not give up until their goals are achieved. Amongst the older generation of Banjar, this idiom is regarded as a quintessential trait of Banjarese culture.
The Banjar or urang Banjar (Banjar people) as they call themselves, are the smallest group that make up the Malay community in Singapore. Many of them are able to trace the journeys of their ancestors from South Kalimantan to Singapore from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. The social memories as well as community and personal stories of the Banjar are collectively embedded in various sites across the Malay Archipelago, where small but significant Banjar communities have established their presence.
In Singapore, many Banjar strive to preserve Banjarese language and culture through various means despite homogenising forces brought on by urbanisation, modernisation and globalisation. Featuring ethnographic objects, community stories and treasured family belongings, this community co-created exhibition showcases the Banjar's strong sense of kinship, industry and history.
This digital exhibition is a supplement to â€˜Urang Banjar', a community co-created exhibition on display at the Malay Heritage Centre, and features select artefacts and multimedia from the exhibition. To experience the full exhibition, be sure to visit the Malay Heritage Centre from now until 25 July 2021 (visitor information can be found at https://malayheritage.org.sg).

An ethno-cultural group defines itself as a community when its members share a language, material culture as well as a set of cultural norms and practices. Oftentimes, the ethnic community claims a common history and can trace its people's lineage to ancient or even mythical origins. In this respect, the families and individuals featured in this exhibition have come to identify themselves as Banjar through â€˜cultural markers' such as language, traditional dress, customs and cuisines as well as a shared history of ancestry from areas of the Banjar Regency in South Kalimantan.
Beyond a shared cultural heritage, many of the Banjar whose ancestors arrived in Singapore from the later half of the 19th century also associate themselves with a trading or religious family legacy. First and second-generation arrivals who settled in Singapore's early precincts also developed deep connections to the kampungs and neighbourhoods they grew up in. This section introduces the individuals and families who worked closely with MHC to present their respective family histories and connections to areas in the Banjar Regency as well as offer insights into Banjarese culture as it is experienced and practised today.
â€œAll of us are well aware that we are Malay but we don't know which Malay ethnic group we come from. When I found out I was Banjareseâ€¦ as I went along and listened to my dad and his side of the family, constantly talking about their memories, their relatives, majlis, perkahwinan (ceremonies and weddings), planned trips to Banjarmasinâ€¦ this is where I realised this power of history through memory.â€

  What Banjar delicacy are you?
The Banjar are known for their assortment of delectable dishes and desserts, including Soto Banjar and Kueh Bingka, which can be found across the Malay world. Sisters Fauziah and Maskiah, whose photograph can be found in the section below, used to sell some of these delicacies from their store, â€˜Deli Maslina', which continues to operate in Bedok today!
Consisting of a variety of ingredients, Banjar cuisine is well-suited for a range of palates and occasions. Find out more about these dishes through this interactive AR quiz!

Banjar Cosmopolitanism
Till today, the urang Banjar in Singapore frequently mention the ways in which their ancestors in South Kalimantan and themselves were both a part, as well as a product of varied cultural influences in the region. In particular, South Kalimantan's access to open waters and Banjarmasin's natural resources created a thriving cosmopolitan marketplace visited by travellers from neighbouring cities such as Pontianak, Arab and Turkish traders as well as crewmen from Chinese junkships â€“ from as far back as the 14th century.
This section showcases archival materials and other forms of material culture which illustrate how the mercantile Banjar world embraced cross-cultural influences and created a form of intercultural hybridity. Even as South Kalimantan's status as a port city eventually succumbed to British and Dutch colonialism, the Banjar community would continue to interact with the outside world. These interactions took place not just within their increasingly thriving port, but also in the context of their migration out of South Kalimantan.

  Known for its recurrence in Chinese culture, the naga (dragon) also appears in Banjar folklore as a symbol of the underworld. Such folklore often makes reference to two worlds - the land, symbolised by the enggang or rangkong gading i.e. the helmeted hornbill, now a mascot of South Kalimantan and the naga. The underworld is regarded to be the fortress of Putri Junjung Buih while the land is held by Pangeran Suryanata, the king responsible for the inception of the Banjar sultanate.
The naga badudung or badudus is a common feature of Banjar-made boats or perahu and has a few prominent characteristics, including a notably long neck and an agape mouth with a tongue sticking out. The presence of the figurehead is believed to ward off natural disasters from occurring during such regal occasions. In more modern practices, the naga figurehead appears on dragonboats and dragonboat events as well as wedding processions.
â€œO people of Negara-Dipa, lest you clothe yourself with the clothing of the Malays, or the Dutch, or the Chinese, or the Siamese, or the Aceh, or the Acehnese, or the Makassarese, or the Bugis, let us follow the ways of our own lands, following the customs of the Majapahit Empire. Thus our clothings shall follow that of the Javanese.â€

Religion and Reverence
Some ethnographers have argued that the term â€˜Banjar' refers to a few binding elements that glue the disparate communities of South Kalimantan together rather than a specific ethnic group. One of these binding elements is Islam and its deep-seated importance in the Banjar community.
One way in which the Islamic aspect of Banjarese identity is manifested is through the reverence of prominent religious figures like Sheikh Arshad al-Banjari and Haji Mohamed Zaini Abdul Ghani (â€˜Guru Ijai'). In Singapore today, members of the Banjar community speak fondly of such religious Nusantara figures. Some Banjar have also participated in international religious events in Martapura, the birthplace of Sheikh Arshad al-Banjari and Guru Ijai.
Incidentally, Singapore's first Mufti (a country's chief Muslim cleric) Haji Mohamed Sanusi bin Mahmood is of Banjar descent, further reinforcing the importance of religion to the community. The following accounts and objects underline how religion is integral to Banjar identity and imagination, and how, beyond finding cultural significance, religion has also become a means to trace their roots back to South Kalimantan.
â€œIn terms of religion, [the Banjar] are firm, ever since the arrival of Islam from the Demak Sultanate to Sultan Suriansyah who established the Banjar Sultanate which in turn propagated the religion of Islam. Thus, over thereâ€¦ the Muslim person truly adheres to the teachings of the religion, including, say, the buying and selling of items â€“ so when one buys and sells, one buys and sells in accordance with religion.â€

The Diamond Trade
Historically, the island of Borneo is famous for producing a wide range of precious stones and metals. While the Hikayat Banjar mentions â€œgold dustâ€ as an important trade commodity, diamonds (mostly in the form of alluvial deposits along major rivers that cut across the western and southeastern parts of the island) are amongst South Kalimantan's most precious exports. The diamond deposits of Borneo are said to be amongst the earliest mined by early Indians, Malays and Chinese who worked there as far back as 600-1000 CE. Evidence of diamond cutting is also found in the provinces of Ngabang and Pontianak in the southern parts of Borneo (present day Kalimantan).
These diamonds were not only bartered and worn by royalty and the rich, they were also included as part of tributary gifts from the Banjarmasin Sultanate to the Chinese emperor in the 17th century. By the 16th century, Borneo's diamonds were known amongst Portuguese maritime traders and by mid-17th century, the Dutch East India Company established its monopoly over diamond mining and formed part of Banjarmasin's global trade alongside pepper and other goods for the better part of the 19th to early 20th centuries. 
This section provides the historical and socio-economic backdrop to the diamond trade and the mercantile roots of Banjar arrivals to Singapore in the 19th century. The riches gained from the diamond trade as well as the beauty of diamonds and diamond jewellery have led to the persistent association of the urang Banjar with diamonds.
â€œWe had our neighbours â€“ a goldsmithing workshop, an old Chinese man who would be working on these pieces of jewellery, mostly gold pieces, and then we had my uncle who's working across the roadâ€¦ we had also another granduncle who had an office further down this road. Basically [Jalan Pisang] is where the activity of the diamond trade used to be.â€

Martapura is the largest diamond-cutting centre in Indonesia and is a bustling jewellery hub. Diamonds are regularly mined in Banjarbaru, located an hour away from Banjarmasin, before being transported to workshops which house several faceting and polishing machines. The faceting machines used here are also found in India. The machines have heavy bronze wheels attached by a spindle with bearings at the top and bottom, and a belt connects an electric motor to one to six cutting wheels. The round brilliant is the most common diamond cut here.

From Banjarmasin to Singapore
The 1911 Census of Singapore is the first local census that mentions the Banjar community and it notes that there were about 321 Singaporean Banjar residents during that period. However, if we were to  refer to the oral histories of Singapore Banjar families as well as their personal photographs and news clippings, we would be able to trace their existence in Singapore to a far earlier time.
As far back as 1824, Dutch vessels from Banjarmasin began to arrive in Singapore when the former emerged out of decades of Dutch monopoly to become a free port. With this, traders from Banjarmasin like Haji Osman bin Haji Abu Naim and Haji Mahmood bin Abdul Rahim arrived in Singapore and became prominent fixtures within the local community due to their thriving businesses. By the late 1800s and early 1900s, several other Banjar families had begun to settle in Singapore. Driven from their hometowns in South Kalimantan as a result of the Banjarmasin War, these families were drawn to the prospect of peace that Singapore provided.

A Diamond Trail Across Singapores East
From the late 19th to the early 20th centuries, Banjar migrants settled down in various locales around Singapore. Diamond industry pioneers such as Haji Osman, Haji Mahmood and Haji Hassan established themselves in an area of Kampong Gelam which later became known as Jalan Intan, or Kampong Intan (today's Baghdad Street). Located a stone's throw from Kampong Intan was also a diamond polishing workshop owned by Banjar merchant Haji Hassan, located at Jalan Pisang along North Bridge Road.
Banjar communities could also be found eastwards near the shores of today's Changi beach and East Coast Park as well as Kembangan and Geylang Serai. These sites were probably chosen by early Banjar settlers who fished for a living. They stayed in purpose-built rumah panggung (houses on stilts) in contrast to Banjar entrepreneurs in Kampong Gelam who stayed in shophouses. 
Other sites in the eastern parts of Singapore where Banjar communities could be found include kampungs in Geylang (Lorong 26, 35, Lorong Engku Aman) and Changi (Kampong Banjar, Kampong Beting Kusah, Somapah, Telok Paku, Kampong Changi, Kampong Padang Terbakar) as well as today's East Coast (Kampong Ayer Gemuroh, Telok Mata Ikan) and Eunos (Kampong Banjar, Jalan Keluang, Jalan Pagak).
â€œThis house [at Lorong Marican] represented a house rich with history. That was where my uncles gathered in my youth, to speak to my father and reminisce about their father and grandfather. It was only much later that I realised that it was because of who my grandfather [Haji Mahmood] was.â€

Basa Banjar
Based on oral accounts, it can be determined that the language of the Banjar community, basa Banjar, remains an important identity marker across generations. Although many from the Banjar community in Singapore today do not converse in basa Banjar, the language provides the community with a sense of familiarity and sentimentality.
For the few urang Banjar who can converse in the language, basa Banjar is usually spoken in their households and during interactions with relatives from other places in the region such as Batu Pahat and Pontianak. In an attempt to keep the language alive, various members of the community launched a basa Banjar workshop initiative in 2014, where members of the community could attend classes taught by former Malay language teacher, Rasid Mastur. This language class is just one of the many ways where the Banjarese of today are re-discovering aspects of their heritage. Most importantly, these are done through physical interactions and the company of their fellow kinsfolk.
â€œMy aspirations for the coming generations of urang Banjar are that they would remember their culture, language, for it would not be good to forget one's origins. In the words of a traditional Banjar slogan, haram manyarah waja sampai kaputing â€“ whatever we do should be done well.â€

Arriving in Singapore from Banjarmasin, Martapura and Batu Pahat (another Banjar settlement) presented unique challenges for pioneer Banjar communities and individuals. Notably, speaking their native Banjar language had to take second place to learning and adapting to new vocabulary and lingo used in social, commercial and administrative settings in Singapore.

Basa Banja is not only functional, it also possesses a cultural role and is used in various performances as a way of communicating certain narratives and ideas. This is the case for madihin, an oral and aural performance that is infused with various social messages. Popular since the 1960s in South Kalimantan, madihin consists of oral recitations which are accompanied by the beat of the gendang, a drum-like instrument.
Madihin is usually performed at cultural events, such as the aruh ganal or festivities that promote traditional Banjarese identity. Derived from the Arabic word madah which means advice or in some instances, praise, the art of madihin has been known to reflect values such as tolerance, discipline, hard work, responsibility and patriotism. Hence, this literary performance has been used by the Banjar community to promote moral education, especially amongst the younger generation.

Since several years ago, several members of the Banjar community have convened in Siglap Community Centre in order to learn and practice their native mother tongue, basa Banjar. Cikgu Rasid bin Mastur, a native from Banjarmasin who moved to Singapore in his youth, created his own teaching materials for these lessons, including worksheets consisting of Banjar vocabulary. Here, the MHC has created a worksheet inspired by Cikgu Rasid's efforts that provides a simple introduction to the beauty of Basa Banjar!
Family Life
The family holds a central position in the Banjar community because families are both the source and bearer of Banjar history, culture and traditions. Many of the families in the Singapore-Banjar community can trace their lineage to ancestors who have travelled out of the Banjar Regency in South Kalimantan. Some arrived here in the late 19th century and maintained social and business links back in South Kalimantan through seasonal travel, trade and other commercial activities.
Marriages were also arranged between families in Banjarmasin and Martapura and migrant Banjar communities in various parts of the Malay Archipelago. Over time, being the smallest Malay sub-ethnic group in Singapore has meant having to marry outside their ethnno-cultural group and this phenomenon seems to have made the Banjar here more aware of the need to preserve elements of their intangible cultural heritage, including wedding customs and cuisine lest they disappear in the melting pot of multi-culturalism.
This section presents how some families have been expressing their Banjar cultural identity through practising various aspects of Banjarese culture in their daily lives.

Many local Banjar families today are likely to eat food which is considered â€˜Malay' cuisine to the average person. However, many of the Banjar interviewed mentioned dishes which are specific to provinces and locales in South Kalimantan  and were brought over to Singapore when their families relocated here.
While families with first-generation Singapore-Banjarese relatives grew up with Banjar dishes as everyday meals, successive generations are likely to enjoy them only during special occasions such as festive holidays, weddings andfamily and/or community gatherings. Nonetheless, these dishes are a simple yet meaningful way by which generations of Banjar families connect with one another and celebrate their culture.

  Traditionally, Banjar families preferred to strengthen familial, economic and community ties through marriages amongst extended family members. Hence, it was not uncommon for urang Banjar who settled in Singapore and other parts of the archipelago, especially those from wealthier backgrounds, to matchmake their sons and daugthers of marriageable age with suitable cousins or even relatives of their in-laws.
A typical Banjar wedding would be a sizeable affair as entire families of relatives, both immediate and distant, are invited to celebrate the occasion. It is also not uncommon for Singapore-Banjar who still have familial ties in Banjarmasin, Martapura or Pontianak, to travel to ancestral towns or villages to attend wedding receptions.
Becoming Banjar
The Banjar community in Singapore today continue to find means of commemorating their unique identity and heritage, including culinary heritage and their material culture!

Conclusion
For many of the Singapore-Banjar community, the concept of â€˜Banjar-ness' is one that they do not take for granted due to the community's small numbers as well as the gradual erosion of various Banjarese cultural practices and the decline in the use of basa Banjar amongst younger Banjar Singaporeans who relate more to a more homogenised Singapore-Malay identity.
Fortunately, the Banjar identity is kept alive here by second and third-generation Banjar who preserve and promote their traditions, language and culture through community initiatives such as language classes and cultural showcases, and by practicising customs such as cooking Banjarese heritage dishes and donning traditional wear during festive occasions and aruh ganal.
The concept of â€˜Banjar-ness' is further strengthened by familial ties and the sense of kinship which binds the local Banjar community to larger Banjar communities in South Kalimantan and other parts of the Malay Archipelago. This extended family also plays a key role in awakening, shaping and reiterating â€˜Banjar-ness' through the sharing of stories of historical events and how their forebears overcame challenges and made their mark in the societies where they settled.
As a result, the Banjarese adage â€˜haram menyarah waja sampai kaputing' continues to resonate strongly with the Singapore-Banjar community as being Banjar means having the determination to face challenges and succeed against all odds. Consequently, in spite of its small numbers, the local Banjar community has contributed in various ways to Singapore's development as a young nation and continues to be an integral part of Singapore-Malay society.

The loud, joyous, and colourful tradition of lohei, or the tossing of raw fish salad, is a boisterous Chinese New Year highlight in Singapore. Every ingredient has a symbolic, auspicious phrase to be exclaimed as it is added to the salad, and diners often toss the salad as high as possible into the air to welcome greater abundance and prosperity.
Introduction
Lohei, or æžèµ· in Cantonese, is one of the biggest highlights during Chinese New Year, where families and friends come together to â€œtoss up a good fortuneâ€. The yusheng, é±¼ç”Ÿ, is a mixture of thinly sliced raw fish and shredded vegetables, seasonings, and condiments - added one by one in a specific order. Each ingredient symbolises well-wishing. With each added ingredient, an auspicious phrase is recited.
Diners would then stand around the table, each with a pair of chopsticks to toss the mix while exchanging blessings. It is popularly believed that the higher the toss, the better one's prospects and fortune for the year ahead.

Lohei â€“ the evolution of a tradition that constantly brings people together
A humble 2,000-year-old tradition
The earliest written documentation of eating raw fish in Chinese culture traces back to 823 BCE during the Zhou Dynasty (1046 BCEâ€“256 BCE). During the Han dynasty (206 BCEâ€“220 CE), it became so popular that Chinese scholars such as Cao Zhi wrote poems praising the delicacy. However, towards the end of the Qing dynasty (1889 CEâ€“1912 CE) the dish almost disappeared in China and was only common in the southern parts of Guangzhou and Chaozhou.
In the Guangzhou cities of Jiangmen and Shunde, fishermen would celebrate the 7th day of Lunar New Year, or äººæ—¥, believed to be the birthday of all of humanity. On this day, the fishermen would feast on their catches â€“ a humble, raw common carp dish mixed with soy sauce, vinegar, peanut oil, pickled shallots, and shredded vegetables.
Yu Sheng, a name of abundance
These early fishermen called the dish yusheng, which plays beautifully on the homophones of both â€œé±¼â€ (fish) and â€œä½™â€ (abundance), as well as â€œç”Ÿâ€, which means both â€˜raw' and â€˜life'. So, yusheng also means â€œabundance of wealth and long lifeâ€.
Yusheng was introduced by Cantonese and Teochew immigrants from China. Since the 1930s, what started out as a simple raw fish dish has gone through multiple evolutions to become the dish it is known as today.
The commonly used fish in yusheng are either salmon or wolf herring. But in recent years, abalone and tuna have become the new adaptations depending on family culture and preferences.
The forefathers of yusheng in Singapore â€“ Four Heavenly Kings
Early immigrants to Singapore had adapted the dish, such as replacing grass carp with wolf herring to avoid parasites from carp. Yusheng in the 1900s consisted of raw fish, slices of cucumber, radish, and coriander topped with vinegar, oil and sugar. As the dish evolved according to local tastes and ingredients, Loong Yik Kee Restaurant started selling its unique version in 1933, with the addition of pickled vegetables, sugar and vinegar.
As the trend caught on, chefs in Singapore started experimenting with their own versions. In 1964, four chefs at the newly opened Lai Wah Restaurant (known affectionately as the â€œFour Heavenly Kingsâ€) Loke Yuke Pui, Than Mui Kai Yu, Hooi Kok Wai, and Sin Leung, came up with the â€œä¸ƒå½©é±¼ç”Ÿâ€ (seven-coloured raw fish salad). Their version was introduced with improved fragrance, more colours, and served with greater texture and depth with the addition of peanut and flour crisps.
Master chef Hooi Kok Wai, co-founder of Dragon Phoenix restaurant, still spends the majority of his day at wet markets in search of good and fresh fish.
â€œWe also gave our yusheng different names. Since everyone likes prosperity, we called it â€˜å¥½è¿é±¼ç”Ÿ' (good luck yusheng), â€˜å‘è´¢é±¼ç”Ÿ' (prosperity yusheng) and â€˜é¸¿è¿é±¼ç”Ÿ' (fortune yusheng).â€
- Chef Hooi Kok Wai
Lohei - Created by the people, loved across generations
Yusheng became widely popular in Singapore after the Four Heavenly Kings decided to add their seven-coloured yusheng to their Chinese New Year set dinners. The trend picked up in the 1970s, when the younger diners started embracing it.
When the dish was first introduced, the four chefs paired auspicious phrases with some of the original ingredients. Red pickled ginger was paired with â€œé¸¿è¿å½“å¤´â€, or â€œGood luck is approachingâ€. Persimmon came with â€œå››å­£å¹³å®‰â€, translating to â€œFour seasons of peace and prosperityâ€. For five spice powder or pepper, they would say â€œäº”ç¦ä¸´é—¨â€, â€œ5 blessings â€“ longevity, wealth, health, kindness and peace upon your homeâ€.
The customers themselves spontaneously associated other ingredients with their own auspicious phrases and well wishes.
Some references also speculated that because the dish was so big and difficult to mix evenly, diners started to stand up from their seats to help the waiter toss the yusheng. This somehow evolved to become a ritual where everyone stands up as a celebration of togetherness.
As the popularity of yusheng soared throughout Singapore and Malaysia, it gradually became the must-have dish of today. Every family dinner or corporate gathering during Chinese New Year would have to involve lohei. This practice is celebrated at restaurants, homes, and office pantries, and came to include friends and colleagues from different cultures â€“ wherever people fancied a lively gathering around the table.

  Lohei â€“ the evolution of a tradition that constantly brings people together
Today, friends and families celebrate lohei in restaurants and homes, welcoming the new year with words of prosperity and a strong sense of togetherness. Every ingredient represents a blessing, and every lohei signifies a strong sense of unity and good intentions for the new year.
As times evolve, the yusheng dish continues to incorporate new adaptations to suit different preferences, welcoming diners from other cultures to join in the celebrations.
â€œFor instance, some add abalone, salmon and even lobster. The ingredients then become more flavourful. To customers, more choices is always a good thing. If yusheng can be brought to greater heights and out of this region, that will be the best. However, I feel that fish should still be at the heart of yusheng.â€
- Chef Hooi Kok Wai
Singapore restaurants in recent years have also started offering halal yusheng1, takeaway yusheng, vegetarian and vegan yusheng (fish is replaced by gluten strips of vegetable), and even a yusheng buffet2. Those looking for a convenient option can even pick up a ready-made yusheng from the supermarket to bring home for the toss.
This year, Singaporeans will also get to experience a different kind of lohei to help us stay safe during the global Covid-19 pandemic. Diners at restaurants will have to refrain from shouting their auspicious phrases while donning a face mask. But despite these limitations, lohei remains part of many Singaporeans' Chinese New Year celebrations this year, and perhaps as Chef Hooi suggested, â€œSilence is golden, and perhaps this might even add more prosperity to our lohei.â€

Singaporeans have fond memories of their beloved hawker centres. They bear witness to significant as well as ordinary events such as our first taste of chilli, our birthday celebrations, our breakfast rituals and the constant satisfying of our hunger pangs. Hawker centres allow us to gather and eat at communal tables, savouring and partaking in each other's food heritage.

It is a place where we build our sense of solidarity as we stand side by side in line for that famous nasi lemak (â€œcoconut milk riceâ€ in Malay) while discussing where the best Indian rojak (â€œmixtureâ€ in Malay) can be found. Hawker centres, however, did not exist in the years before independence in 1965. To examine what precipitated their formation, let's examine this issue with a view from the top, beginning in 1950 with what the Colonial Government termed as the â€œHawker Problemâ€.
THE HAWKER PROBLEM
In 1950, the Governor of the Crown Colony of Singapore, Sir F. Gimson, established the Hawkers Inquiry Commission to study and recommend solutions for what the government termed as the â€œHawker Problemâ€. According to an article from The Straits Times in November, 1950, hawkers were seen by government officials as â€œprimarily a nuisance to be removed from the streetsâ€, because their unsanitary conditions were contributing to the spread of diseases while their stalls were obstructing cleaners from tidying up the streets during the post-war era.

An earlier attempt in the 1930s to license hawkers was not effective because most hawkers were illiterate and did not understand the requisite hygiene standards to get licensed. The 1950 report reflected that about two-thirds to three-quarters of hawkers were operating illegally without licences. Police constables who were tasked with enforcing hawker licenses were regularly bribed. Frequent police raids carried out on illegal hawkers were also criticised for not only being ineffective at deterring illegal hawking, but also causing unnecessarily painful losses to the poor hawkers. The hawkers received widespread public support because they provided meals at affordable prices. Any attempt at dismantling the hawkers' livelihood was perceived to be an excessive abuse of colonial authority.
Some solutions were proposed, including making licenses more attractive to hawkers. Another recommendation to place hawkers into approved shelters or markets was deemed ineffective because people would rather eat outdoors where there was better ventilation. Unless there was a provision for the wholesale rebuilding of entire residential estates, there would be no easy solution to the â€œHawker Problemâ€.

POST-INDEPENDENCE: A CHANCE TO REBUILD
The golden opportunity to redevelop large neighbourhoods came after independence in 1965. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) was given the authority to rebuild entire housing estates to accommodate new residents from the old kampongs (â€œvillageâ€ in Malay). In order to feed residents from these new neighbourhoods, the Parliament legislated a programme to build hawker centres in conjunction with new housing and industrial estates. From 1971 to 1986, 113 government hawker centres were constructed to house street-side hawkers.

According to Professor Lily Kong, in her 2007 book Singapore Hawker Centres: People, Places, Food, poor hygiene remained an issue despite the new facilities. Hawker centres were dirty as a result of stray animals and rodents eating leftovers from the floors.
Compounding matters, hawkers also carried on their bad habits from their street hawker days, such as smoking while preparing food or handling raw food and money without washing their hands. These conditions provoked urgent action and in the 1980s, the government started enforcing stricter hygiene practices through punitive fines. This was further enhanced in 1987, when a Point Demerits System was put in place. Hawkers who broke hygiene rules were given demerit points and repeated offenders would have their licenses revoked.
Beyond reactionary measures, the Ministry of Environment also instituted pre-emptive solutions to deal with refuse and trash in the hawker centres. Contract cleaners were employed to clear tables of crockery and leftover food quickly. Hawkers also had to undergo an annual inspection and were given a hygiene grade, from A to D, which had to be prominently displayed one their storefronts. A â€œDâ€ grade would most certainly turn customers away.
The Ministry of Environment also launched a public education campaign, encouraging the public to exercise its consumer power to influence hawkers to maintain hygiene standards through the dissemination of pamphlets, brochures and travelling exhibitions. Then Minister for Environment, Dr Ahmad Mattar, said in 1989 that as long as people continued to patronise eating establishments and hawker stalls of questionable hygienic conditions, Singapore would not be able to weed out irresponsible food handlers.
Government officials recognised the role of hawker centres as more than mere food establishments. In 1977, Mr Chai Chong Yii, then Member of Parliament for Bukit Batok and Senior Minister of State for Education, extolled hawkers to â€œwork in harmony and with the spirit of mutual accommodationâ€. Hawker centres were places where people from all walks of life could gather to enjoy a wide variety of food options. Their integration with town centres and convenient location next to bus interchanges, ensured that hawker centres remained popular among neighbourhood residents.
NEW HAWKER CENTRES FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM
Over time, hawker centres were inevitably beginning to show signs of deterioration. A Straits Times report in September 2000 revealed that hawkers wanted better ventilation in hawker centres as it could become very stuffy in the late afternoon after the lunch crowd had left.
As neighbourhoods were starting to get upgraded from the 1990s, the Ministry of Environment took the opportunity in 2001 to launch the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme. Then Acting Minister for the Environment, Mr Lim Swee Say, told The Straits Times in February of 2001 that as we were upgrading our living environment, it was only appropriate that we also upgraded our eating environment.
Renovated hawker centres were installed with anti-slip floorings, new sewage and water pipes, a reorganised table and stool layout, as well as innovative architectural features to improve ventilation.
The upgrading process involved gathering feedback and suggestions from the public and the hawkers themselves. One major suggestion was to retain the characteristic features of individual hawker centres, such as iconic trees or signboards.
LOOKING BEYOND
In October 2011, the Singapore government announced that it would build 10 more hawker centres, after a hiatus of 26 years, focusing on HDB towns currently facing an under-provision of eating options, subject to land availability. In 2012, the government announced the towns where the 10 new hawker centres will be built. These include the first three new hawker centres in Bukit Panjang, Hougang and Tampines. In March 2015, it was announced that another 10 new hawker centres would be built by 2027.

As many early-generation hawkers began to retire, a group of Singaporeans took it upon themselves to catalogue their valuable history, knowledge and skills for the benefit of future generations. Dr Leslie Tay, a family physician, started his blog ieatishootipost in 2006 to post professionally crafted photos of hawker favourites, helping to chronicle and digitise Singapore's hawker heritage online. He also interviews venerable store owners, who are always happy to share something witty and memorable, and sometimes drop hints of their secret ingredients.
Hawker centres have withstood the test of time and continue to reinvent and prepare themselves for the future. Even in today's modern age, the old-school charm of savouring delicious hawker fare in the midst of the clanging of woks and the sizzling hiss of fried garlic is not one that can be easily replaced. Hawker centres have certainly evolved from being a problem in the earlier part of the 20th century to today forming an indelible part of our everyday lives.

Dr Mohammed Effendy
For centuries, the political, cultural and economic development of Southeast Asian communities have been greatly influenced by migrants and sojourners from within and outside the region. The Bugis have had a great impact on the political, cultural and economic development of Singapore and Southeast Asia during the pre-colonial and colonial periods. Apart from economic and cultural prowess, the Bugis were also known for their martial prowess. As early as 1699, Bugis princes and warriors were crucial in negating Raja Kecil of Siak's attempt to usurp the Johor-Riau-Lingga throne. The connection between Bugis and Malay rulers was sealed with the Persetiaan Marhum Sungai Baru (Oath of Sungai Baru) in October 1722, a mutual assistance pact which led to the Bugis becoming more active in the warfare and politics of Malay kingdoms in the 18th and 19th centuries.
However, what is not as well-known is how these Bugis warriors from Sulawesi fought in the Malay world and in various parts of Southeast Asia. Many are sojourners to Southeast Asia and the descendants of these sojourners still remember the legacy of historical exchange and cultural interaction with the communities that they have interacted with.
This project aims to take a small step in fulfilling these research gaps to better understand the fighting systems of the various Bugis and Makassar silat schools from Sulawesi. It does so in pursuit of a better understanding of how these communities could have fought in the past.
The results can be seen through the writeups and short videos that document the silat moves and background of the various Bugis and Makassar silat schools of Sulawesi interviewed for the project. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted further research efforts, it is hoped that more research can be conducted once the pandemic is over to further ascertain the veracity of these memories.

This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Barani Maurilingi Bantaeng (Bugis, Sulawesi)
The Barani Maurilingi Bantaeng silat school has a long history that dates back to the 18th century. This silat school's style is derived from the pendekar warriors led by Daeng Padupa, who is remembered by some communities in Sulawesi as a prince and trader who went to Singapore in the 18th or 19th centuries. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its historical connections with Singapore.
Jala Rabanna Bantaeng (Bugis, Sulawesi)
The Jala Rabanna Bantaeng silat school's style originates from the island of Pejenekan in Sulawesi, Indonesia. This is the island where some believe that the pendekar warriors of Daeng Padupa, who is remembered by some communities in Sulawesi as a prince and trader who went to Singapore in the 18th or 19th centuries. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its historical connections with Singapore.
Benteng Bassia (Bugis, Sulawesi)
The Benteng Bassia silat school style is suited for use in battles on both land and sea. Students are taught the secrets of boarding ships by using a plank, and fighting in narrow spaces on ships. The students are also taught self-defence moves, how to analyse an opponent's intentions and the effects of each strike they make. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Manca Bawa Kareng (Bugis, Sulawesi)
The Manca Bawa Kareng silat style is a martial arts style that originates from the pendekar warriors of Bantaeng in South Sulawesi, modern-day Indonesia. This silat style is based on the movements of the tiger and focuses on taking the initiative in the attack and defeating the enemy totally. It is usually performed at ceremonies and formal occasions in South Sulawesi. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Menca Sangge (Bugis, Sulawesi)
The exact origins of the Menca Sangge silat style are unknown, but legend has it that many Sulewatang (Vice-Regal authorities) throughout the kingdom of Bone in modern-day Indonesia would come and perform the art in the royal gelanggang (silat arena) in front of the king. Variations of the Menca Sangge style are still practiced today by Sulewatang descendants in Singapore and Perak in Malaysia. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Unru Pitu Akeleng Wajo (Bugis, Sulawesi)
The Unru Pitu silat style places emphasis on instinct-based techniques. It encompasses seven basic movements, takedown moves and a special 4-direction movement that facilitates fighting efficiency. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Sendeng Semperen Tujuh (Bugis, Sulawesi)
Semperen Tujuh is a relatively new martial arts school that was established in the 1980s. It focuses on self-defense, with the school's students being grounded in values like humility, morality and self-control. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Assigio (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Assigio silat school's style is characterized by fast and explosive movements like hand and feet strikes to engage an opponent. It places emphasis on pre-empting the enemy's moves to achieve victory. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Embayya Ri Bontolanra (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Embayya Ri Bontolanra silat school's style originates from Makassar, Indonesia. It combines Chinese martial arts and Manca (Makassar silat), and can be argued to be a reflection of Makassar's cosmopolitan nature and its port, which has attracted traders from all over for centuries. The Embayya Ri Bontolanra silat style has a historical connection with Singapore as it was once taught in Singapore. Although this silat style has since disappeared from Singapore, it still continues to thrive in Makassar through the silat schools there.
Ikatan Pencak Silat Sulawesi (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Ikatan Pencak Silat Sulawesi silat school's style dates back to the 16th century. It is a prominent silat tradition with links to the ancient kingdom of Gowa in modern-day Makassar, Indonesia. The school's silat style is characterised by practical moves and a focus on countering the opponent's moves with speed and agility. Students are also taught how to better focus and control their emotions to channel their inner energies towards silat and to achieve victory. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its historical connections with Singapore.
Ikatan Perguruan Silat Budaya Makassar (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Ikatan Perguruan Silat Budaya Makassar silat school's style is characterised by fluid movements, and a focus on humbleness. It is a style of Manca (Makassar Silat) that has existed for well over a century. Students are taught that the school's moves are to be used only in self-defense and never against vulnerable or weak people. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its historical connections with Singapore.
Kalase'rena Gowa (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Kalase'rena Gowa silat style originates from the Gowa district of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. This silat style is accompanied by traditional silat music, with the silat moves following the music rhythm. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its historical connections with Singapore.
Manca Datu Lapang Gowa (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Manca Datu Lapang Gowa silat style originates from Makassar, Indonesia. According to local folklore, this silat style was once taught in Siglap, Singapore by Daeng Temalalang, the grandfather of the current guru, Daeng Bategunung, during the mid-20th century. The school's silat style is a combination of martial arts moves passed down through the family and the silat moves learnt from other silat groups in Makassar, Indonesia. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Manca Paddang Tana Doang Selayar (Sulawesi)
The Manca Paddang Tana Doang Selayar silat style originates from Kajang in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The school's silat style is characterized by the accompaniment of a sword as part of its moves. Its founding guru, Daeng Muhammad Salleh, started teaching his school's signature silat moves to 20 students in Selayar after Indonesia's independence in August 1945. The pool of disciples soon expanded in the years after 1945 to include students from Singapore and other parts of Indonesia like Java and the islands of Bawean, Bangka and Belitung. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Manca Sipakalabbiri Gowa (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Manca Sipakalabbiri Gowa silat style is characterised by Sipakalabbiri, a style dating back to the 15th century. It is characterised by the use of empty hand strikes and the use of weapons like the tombak (spear), badik (dagger) and parang (knife) in combat. This silat style has special significance for the research project due to its sociocultural connections with Singapore.
Pusaka Nusantara Abbulo Sibatang Gowa (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Pusaka Nusantara Abbulo Sibatang silat style originates from Makassar, Indonesia. This silat style is said to have been originally practiced by royal cooks who specialised in making dodol, a coconut-based dessert popular in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The jurus (strikes) draw inspiration from the moves involved in making dodol. According to local folklore of some communities in Sulawesi, these cooks were originally from Palembang in Sumatra, and are also thought to have been followers of Parameswara, the legendary figure in the history of Singapore who established the Kingdom of Singapura (1299-1398). Hence, this silat style has special significance for the research project due to its historical connections with Singapore.
Rampa Appaka Abbulo Sibatang (Makassar, Sulawesi)
The Rampa Appaka Abbulo Sibatang silat style originates from Makassar, Indonesia. This silat style is characterised by animal-based movements of the tiger and eagle, and elements of Chinese and Bugis martial arts.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Sue-Sismondo-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"â€œArt has to be in my life,â€ says Sue Sismondo, who holds an Architecture and Design degree. It should therefore come as no surprise that she should feel so at home at the Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC).
There is much to be proud of about the HCC located in Jurong. It lays claim to many firsts â€” it is home to the priceless artefacts and cultural heritage of Singapore's national collection, it is the first of its kind in the region, and it has a centralised collections repository with conservation laboratories all under one roof. Sue has been a docent there for the past 15 years.
As a young adult, she worked in New York City as an Art Director. Once married, she and her husband started to travel widely. They would always bring back one or two pieces of artwork from the countries they visited to serve as reminders of their travels. As an HCC volunteer, she is now able to continue this enjoyment of art.
Early days of volunteering
Sue has been with the Friends of the Museum (FOM) since 1983. One trigger for signing up came from the walking tours of Singapore with Geraldene Lowe-Ismail during Sue's first year here. One tour was all it took for Sue to decide to join the FOM.
Through the walking tours, Sue learned about the history, lives, and cultural traditions of the people in those neighbourhoods. She watched as Geraldine spoke to the shopkeepers and shared the stories with those on her trail. Her interest in the people, the culture, and the country grew.
In the early days with FOM, Sue focussed more on participating in FOM study groups and preparing lectures for the FOM Lecture Series at the National Museum of Singapore (NMS). â€œI was in charge of the lecture series for a term, did research for exhibitions and helped organise two exhibitions at the NMS â€“ Things Japanese and Peranakan Heritage. I served as FOM President and then a member of the FOM Advisory Committee in the 1990s, during the expansion of the museum sector.â€
When Sue attended the official opening of the HCC on 15 September 2000, FOM docents conducted tours of the centre. Sue was fascinated by the behind-the-scenes-tour and joined the next training offered by the centre. The quest was always about learning something new. HCC proved to be an ideal location for that. She learnt so much about the work the HCC staff did. She is quick to add that the professionals there are unique with a rare blend of expertise and unflagging patience. These traits are precisely what Sue also uses as part of her tours.
Guiding at the HCC
As a docent, Sue has come to find that visitors are most fascinated by what conservators do. â€œConservators look beneath the surface of works of art to discern the artist's inspiration.â€ Sue considers this an exceptional gift and skill.
Before any tour, she does a quick recce of the labs to find out if any of the conservators will be present to chat with the visitors. Often, they will explain what they are working on. Visitors love to hear about the work. The labs often draw gasps of wonder from visitors when they see how much work goes into preparing materials for exhibition including, for instance, fixing any damage to the original works of art.
Sue highlights that what visitors to the art museums see is an integrated work of art. The conservators see it in its original state and determine through research and testing what the artist worked with at the outset and what is necessary to properly repair and conserve the art to ensure its long-term survival. â€œThat's where you get the real â€˜wow' moment,â€ says Sue. Often, everyone walks away from such a tour with a healthy respect for the conservators and the scientific knowledge and techniques they have mastered.
HCC is a secure facility, so tours are by appointment only. For most visitors, as the work of HCC is completely outside their expertise or knowledge, they are attentive and appreciative.
Sue explains that her tour focuses on two things. First, it looks at preventive conservation. This involves methods of taking care of items so they are secure and will last. This stage is more about the process and procedure than about the art per se. The second part of the tour is the conservation labs. There are four specialty labs: for objects, paper, paintings, and textiles.
â€œTours at HCC enable visitors to better understand what happens beyond the museum walls: how Singapore's art and heritage materials are conserved for the future and how artefacts are prepared for exhibition,â€ explains Sue.
The best takeaways
Sue walks away from each tour at HCC with a sense of gratitude and respect for the staff and conservators, some of whom she has come to know very well. â€œI would like to compliment the professionals at HCC for the excellent work they do and the generosity they have shown in sharing knowledge with the volunteers.â€
Most rewarding for Sue is guiding the student visitors from arts management courses in the Polytechnics, the technical education stream or specialist arts schools. â€œFor me it's nice when a kid starts to see some connections to their studies or perhaps career choice.â€ And, that is basically what she cherishes about being a docent â€” the connection she makes with the people, the learning in greater detail of the ways of the people through their art, culture, and artefacts.
Still, at the end of it all, Sue loves the learning opportunities. She adds that it is important to her to be able to â€œto help visitors experience their visits to museums more deeplyâ€.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/green-bus-company/story,"During the 1920s and 1930s, bus services were mainly provided by small seven-seater motor buses known as â€œmosquito busesâ€. These buses plied rural areas which were poorly served by other means of transport (e.g. trams and trolleybuses within the city area) at the time.
A close-up of one of the buses owned and operated by Green Bus Company. (Photograph courtesy of Patrick Ong)
They were popular with the working classes because they were cheap and faster than omnibuses and trolleybuses. Other modes of transport available included rickshaws and light hackney carriages.
In 1921, the registrar of vehicles reported that there were 147 mosquito buses in operation and by 1929, the figure had risen to 456 although it was likely that there was a significant number of unlicensed operators.
By 1935, there were a total of 10 â€œmosquito busâ€ companies that provided such bus services and one of these companies was the Green Bus Company. The other bus companies included Keppel Bus Company, Soon Lee Bus Company and Ngo Hock Bus Company.
Back then, the local bus companies were mainly owned and operated by the Hock Ching (Fu Qing) dialect group from East Fujian Province. These bus companies were also commonly and collectively known as the â€œChinese bus companiesâ€.
The Green Bus Company was formerly known as Rochor Bus Co. and established in 1935 by Ong Kim Hock's brothers and other partners with a fleet of about 35 buses.

In addition, these early private bus companies used to have their respective bus terminals and depots. The Green Bus Company's terminal was located at 2 Angullia Road (Queen Street) and its workshop was located at Bukit Timah Road.
More specifically, the bus terminal for Green Bus Service No. 5 was located at the former Princess Elizabeth Estate at the junction of Elizabeth Drive, Lorong Kemunchup (now Jalan Kemunchup) and Jalan Zamrud. (Note: The bus terminal was demolished in the 1990s although the roads still remain.)
During the 1950s, the Green Bus Company was operating the following routes:
a. Bus No. 1 Queen Street to Johore Bahru
b. Bus No. 2 Queen Street to Lim Chu Kang
c. Bus No. 3 Queen Street to Jurong
d. Bus No. 4 Queen Street to Mandai
e. Bus No. 5 Queen Street to Princess Elizabeth Estate
f. Bus No. 6 Jurong 13th mile to Tanjong Kling
The No. 5 bus route started at Queens Street in Rochor and covered Bukit Timah Road, Upper Bukit Timah Road, Hillview Avenue before ending at Princess Elizabeth Estate.
During the Japanese Occupation, all transport assets were seized and almost all bus services were halted. After World War II, the Chinese companies regained their transport assets and continued operating in their respective districts.
On 1 May 1950, Green Bus Company announced the acquisition of new Vulcan omnibuses, The commencement of its Singapore-Johore bus routes as well as the opening of a new S$100,000 garage and workshop at Bukit Timah.
A fleet of buses owned and operated by Green Bus Company. (Photograph courtesy of Patrick Ong)
Throughout the 1950s, there were a number of incidents involving Green Bus Company which were reported in the press.
These incidents included a bus catching fire at the Green Bus Company's Queen Street bus terminal at 2 Angullia Road (off Queen Street) on 3 November 1953 as well as a bus plunging into the Bukit Timah Canal near the 7th mile Bukit Timah Road on 12 November 1953. In addition, workers from Green Bus Company were also involved in a strike during the labour unrest in the 1950s-early 1960s.
During the post-war period, there were a total of 11 bus companies providing bus services all across the island. The main municipal trolleybus operator was the British-owned Singapore Traction Company (STC) which plied routes in the city area.
The bus services for the remaining areas of Singapore were provided by the 10 Chinese bus companies, each covering a part of the rural and fringe areas of the island.

On 27 April 1960, Mr Ong Cheng Siang, the 44 year old owner of Green Bus Company, was kidnapped after a dinner at Great World. He was held captive in an underground cell somewhere on the east coast of Singapore and released after 9 days following the payment of a substantial ransom. He was reported to have been thrown out of the kidnappers' car at Amber Road where he proceeded to hail a cab back to his motor-workshop at Rochor Canal Road.
In April 1971, the 10 Chinese private bus companies were merged to form three large public bus companies. All existing bus routes operated by the bus operators were rationalised and reorganised to avoid duplication of routes.
Amalgamated Bus Company (ABC) Ltd covered the western parts of Singapore, Associated Bus Services (ABS) Pte Ltd covered the eastern parts of Singapore and United Bus Company (UBC) covered the northern parts of Singapore while Singapore Traction Co. (STC) continued to cover the central parts of Singapore. The buses for each company were assigned a standardised colour: ABC buses were royal blue, ABS buses were red, UBC Ltd buses were yellow and STC buses were green.
As part of the merger, Green Bus Company merged with other Chinese â€œmosquito busâ€ companies to form the United Bus Company (UBC) and the No. 5 bus route was renamed as UBC Service 173 and extended to start from New Bridge Road and covered Orchard Road.
However, the amalgamation of the Chinese bus companies did not succeed and by 1973, the government stepped in to re-organise the bus system and established the Singapore Bus Services (SBS). SBS was subsequently renamed SBS Transit in 2001 when it became a bi-modal bus and rail operator.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/sr-nathan/story,"Early Life
S R Nathan â€“ full name: Sellapan Ramanathan â€“ was born on 3 July 1924. Although born in Singapore, much of Nathan's childhood was spent in the riverine town of Muar, Johor, after his father uprooted the family because of a scrape with the law that resulted in him losing his job. Still, Nathan's father soon managed to secure a job as a lawyer's clerk for a firm that serviced rubber plantations in their new hometown. By the time Nathan turned eight, however, the Great Depression was well on its way to crippling the industrialized world. Much to his dismay, he was sent back to Singapore alone where he lived with his father's eldest brother to continue his education. But a few months later, Nathan and his family were reunited again. Amidst a declining rubber industry, Nathan's father had again lost his job and accrued more debts with the local moneylenders in Muar, needing to move the family back to Singapore as quickly as possible.
His father had a hard time securing a proper job and took on many odd jobs to tide over the growing family of three daughters and two sons. After a long and desperate search, he finally found a job as a supervisor in a quarry in Changi. Sadly, the happiness was short-lived as Nathan's father often drank away his salary and came back empty handed during the weekends. Then, just short of Nathan's ninth birthday, his father suddenly committed suicide.
After the tragedy, Nathan's uncle took the family in under familial obligation. While residing with them, Nathan attended Anglo-Chinese Primary School and Anglo-Chinese Middle School, where he maintained good academic standing. However, following an incident in Standard Five, Nathan was expelled. Although his mother did not say much about his dismissal, Nathan knew she was upset. Fortunately, his eldest cousin managed to enrol Nathan in Rangoon Road Afternoon School, and later Victoria School.
As luck would have it, at the age of 16, Nathan found himself in another hapless situation that saw him face expulsion from school yet again. This time, he was petrified at the prospect of telling his mother and hurting her again, so he decided to run away. Nathan left home to work at an architectural firm called Arbenz & Co, but soon left his job there in fear of running into other family members who worked in the area. He found himself moving back to Muar and working as a hawker's assistant before he was able to find work as a clerk. He dearly missed his family but was determined not to go back home until he had achieved something that would make them proud of him. In the midst of the Japanese Occupation, Nathan crossed the heavily manned Johor-Singapore border and reconciled with his mother and family.
Nathan spent most of the Japanese Occupation in Muar, where a Japanese lieutenant tasked him with chores and duties. The very same lieutenant also gifted him with an English-Japanese dictionary, encouraging him to learn Japanese. Soon, he excelled as a translator and interpreter, working for the top official in the Japanese Civilian Police.
Career
After the end of World War II, Nathan decided to return back to the academic path that he fell off of in his youth. He went on hiatus from his job as a clerk at the Public Works Department to pursue a diploma at the University of Malaya. With the assistance of a bursary from Shell, 30-year-old Nathan graduated from the first ever cohort with a distinction in his Diploma in Social Studies in 1954. There was no doubt of his outstanding achievement: his final year dissertation in school led to the establishment of a new and pioneering government department. He had done extensive studies and research that revealed the issue of lodging housekeepers in the dock area running a system of debt enslavement through the Asian merchant seamen who were awaiting their next shipboard employment. Mr Nathan's research findings were attended to by the then Chief Minister, whose government then set up the Asian Seaman's Registry. In 1956, Nathan was appointed as the first Asian Seaman's Welfare Officer. Prior to this appointment, Nathan had been working in Tan Tock Seng Hospital as an almoner â€“ the first man in Singapore to have filled a medical social work post.
In 1958, 34-year-old Nathan married his childhood sweetheart Urmila Nandey, or Umi, as he fondly referred to her. A teacher by profession, Umi was courted by Nathan for some 16 years. Although 29-year-old Umi's and Nathan's courtship faced many challenges due to their being from different linguistic background (he was Tamil and she Bengali) and Umi's father being a formidable man, their relationship grew to be one of persistence against the odds.

After a few years as an Asian Seaman's Welfare Officer, Nathan was seconded to the Labour Research Unit (LRU) as an assistant director. The LRU was an autonomous body created to assist the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) with research and industrial negotiations during a time of industrial unrest and strikes. Within a few years of joining the unit, he was promoted to director. In 1964, Nathan was conferred the Public Service Star (Bintang Bakti Masyarakat) for his valuable public service to the people of Singapore.
By 1966, Nathan was promoted to the Administrative Service where his postings involved the position of Permanent Secretary in both Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence.  He was awarded the Public Administration Medal (Silver) (Pingat Pentadbiran Awam â€“ Perak) in 1967 for his outstanding efficiency and competence in his capacity.
At the Ministry of Defence, he was also the director of the Security and Intelligence Division (SID) from 1971 to 1979.  It was during his tenure as SID's chief that saw him deal with the hijacking of the Laju ferry in 1974 â€“ among a number of other terrorism incidents that occurred in Singapore then. The incident played out over eight consecutive days when four hijackers from the Japanese Red Army and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine held those on board the ferry hostage. Through intense negotiations that lasted eight days, Nathan managed to negotiate for the safe release of the ferry's crew. He then led a 13-member delegation that accompanied the hijackers on a flight to Kuwait as guarantors of their safe passage. This incident saw him decorated with the Meritorious Service Medal (Pingat Jasa Gemilang) in 1974 for his resource, devotion to duty, and service marked by exceptional ability, merit and exemplary conduct.

In the early 1980s, Nathan held directorship in several other companies such as the Singapore Mint Pte Ltd, The Straits Times Press (London) Ltd, Singapore Press Holdings Ltd and Marshall Cavendish Ltd. From 1983 to 1988, he was Chairman of the Hindu Endowments Board, where he was instrumental to the setting up of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) as founding member, as well as term trustee until 1999.
In 1988, Nathan was appointed Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia before becoming ambassador to the United States two years later. Nathan expertly and astutely manoeuvred both appointments that transpired against strained political ties. Just having stepped in as High Commissioner, he had to manage tensions with Malaysia following Israeli president Chaim Herzog's visit to Singapore. As Ambassador, he had to manage diplomatic crises such as the Michael Fay vandalism  and caning controversy that happened on his watch â€“ he even appeared on the Larry King Live show to defend the country's point of view and stand.
Upon his return from the US in 1996, Nathan was made Ambassador-at-Large and appointed director of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS) at the Nanyang Technological University. He also concurrently held the position of pro-chancellor of the National University of Singapore.
Presidency
In 1999, then President Ong Teng Cheong declared his decision to step down at the end of his term. After being asked to consider running for office by public figures such as Lee Kuan Yew and former president Wee Kim Wee, 75-year-old Nathan who had already announced retirement, came out of it to run for, and be elected President. He was sworn into office on 1 September 1999, and re-elected for a second term without contest on 17 August 2005.

In the course of his two terms as President, Nathan's notable acts include the founding of the President's Challenge in 2000, a series of community-based fundraising events for charity that has raised more than S$100 million between 2000 and 2011 for 500 beneficiary organisations; his gracious hosting of about 50 heads of state and over 100 prime ministers and important delegations on official visits to Singapore; and his approving of the government's use of S$4.9 billion from national reserves to fund the anti-recessionary cushioning in light of the global economic downturn occurring then â€“ marking the first time in history the government was allowed to dip into the reserves.

At the end of his second term as Singapore's sixth president, Nathan cited his age as one of the reasons and announced that he would not be seeking a third term. He stepped down in August 2011, and was succeeded by Tony Tan.
Post-Presidency
Even after stepping down as president at 87 years of age, Nathan did not slow down. He took up appointments of distinguished senior fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and at Singapore Management University's School of Social Sciences. In 2011, he established the S R Nathan Education Upliftment Fund meant to support needy students. In the same year, he published his memoir An Unexpected Journey: Path to Presidency. In 2012, the National University of Singapore launched the S. R. Nathan Professorship in Social Work in his honour. Separately, as a tribute to Nathan's contributions to the country, the Institute of Policy Studies set up the S. R. Nathan Fellowship for the Study of Singapore in 2013. The year of 2013 was a eventful year: Nathan published his second memoir S R Nathan: 50 Stories from My Life and a children's storybook, The Crane and the Crab; and the year end of 2013 saw Nathan being conferred Order of Temasek (First Class), the nation's highest award at the National Day Awards investiture in recognition of his contributions as an outstanding civil servant.
In April 2015, Nathan suffered a stroke but was discharged from the hospital three weeks later.
On the morning of 31 July, Nathan suffered a second stroke and three weeks later, on 22 August, he passed away at Singapore General Hospital at 9.48am.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/chinese-middle-schools-protests/story,"TL;DR
The year was 1956. The authorities, having started clamping down more heavily on leftist activities, were deregistering subversive organisations such as the Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Students' Union1 and arresting agitators.2
These measures drew the ire of thousands of Chinese middle school students who, started sit-ins which later erupted into protests on the streets of Singapore. The violent clashes, in what became known as the Chinese Middle School Riots, took the lives of 13 and injured 123.3
Communism unwelcome on Singapore's shores
Why the harsh stance on the part of the Singapore government?
At the time, communism was known to be oppressive and disruptive. Among other things, communist countries tended to suppress freedom of religion and civil rights. Millions of lives were lost under these brutal regimes.4 Many governments were thus averse to communism.
Singapore was no different. The authorities here leapt into action when communism came knocking on the island's door in the 1950s. By then, a good number of Chinese in Malaya had taken a shine to it.5 Wary of foreign influences filtering downstream, the authorities acted to address the uptake.6 They believed communism could very easily destabilise the island which was still recovering from the bitter wounds of World War II.7
Purging pro-communist organisations
Lim Yew Hock succeeded David Marshall as chief minister in 1956,8 and he made it his priority to stem the threat of communism and tighten Singapore's internal security.9 Some 300 activists and 10 organisations including the Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Students' Union, Singapore Women's Association and the Chinese Musical Gong Society, were banned that very year for their pro-communist stances and activities.10
The Singapore Chinese Middle Schools Students' Union in particular was charged for indoctrinating and intimidating its students, and for getting involved in political activities outside its licensed scope.
Protests erupt

The government's arrests and bans sparked sit-ins among 3,000 students from Chung Cheng High School and Chinese High School on 25 September. In a show of solidarity, their counterparts at Nanyang Girls' School, Nan Chiau Girls' High School, Chung Hwa Girls' High School and Yoke Eng High School gathered for protest meetings.11 At this point, students were by and large adhering to government requirements which prohibited lingering on campuses between the hours of 7.30pm and 7.30am.12
They however reacted fiercely when the government undertook harsher measures to quell the communist threat. The authorities had on 10 October, expelled 142 students, fired two teachers and issued warnings to seven other educators.13 Enraged student protestors from Chung Cheng High School and Chinese High School took control of their school grounds, hung up anti-government posters in defiance, and actively condemned the government's actions.
Two days later, the government ordered the temporary closure of schools. Emboldened by moral and material support from groups such as the Singapore Farmers' Association, bus workers, and Nanyang University undergraduates,14 students stood their ground and remained encamped in their schools.
On 22 and 23 October, the same group of students rallied peers in other Chinese middle schools to skip class.15
A violent showdown
Police officers were activated to clear Chinese High School of students who had barricaded themselves in the compound. (c1956. Image from the National Archives, United Kingdom.)
In an attempt to put an end to the protests, the chief minister went on television and radio to instruct parents to take their children home by 8pm on 25 October.16 This was not entirely effective.17
That night, crowds comprising concerned parents, bus conductors, workers, and students from other schools gathered at both protest sites.18
Protestors attacked uniformed officers, torched and overturned police cars and damaged other vehicles. Soon after, riots broke out across the island. The government reacted by imposing an emergency curfew from 12.21 a.m. to 6 a.m. on 26 October. During these hours, the police evicted encamped students using tear gas.19
On 27 October, the police raided the headquarters of pro-communist unions and arrested 219 people.20 Among them were union leaders Fong Swee Suan, Lim Chin Siong,21 C.V. Devan Nair,22 Sidney Woodhull23 and James Puthucheary.24
Order restored
The nationwide violence resulted in property damage, numerous casualties and the deaths of 13 people. (c1956. Image from The National Archives, United Kingdom.)
Order was finally restored on 28 October. By this time, 13 had died and 123 were injured.25 A total of 101 vehicles were wrecked while several buildings and 31 vehicles were burnt.26
The police ended up detaining more than 2,000 people for rioting, breaking curfew, disrupting public security, and other offences.
A few weeks later, on 13 November 1956, the schools involved in the riots resumed classes as per normal27 â€“ fears of a communist takeover finally put to rest.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/G-T-Lye-Providing-a-window-into-Peranakan-culture/story,"Gwee Thian Lye made his stage debut in 1984 while in his mid-40s, performing in Pileh Menantu (Choosing a Daughter-In-Law). It was the first step in an illustrious career that would see his stage name of G. T. Lye become synonymous with the arts of wayang peranakan and dondang sayang.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - GT Lye
  At the time of his debut, Pileh Menantu was the first wayang peranakan play to be staged in Singapore in 25 years. Inspired by the popular Malay-language theatre of bangsawan, the Peranakan community had devised wayang peranakan, which is performed in Baba Malay. This theatrical form captured the imagination of the Peranakans in the early 20th century and had a comeback in the 1950s after World War II, before gradually fading from the limelight by the 1980s. In this sense, Pileh Menantu marked a watershed in the revival of a regional art form with deep, cross-cultural roots, and through which the Peranakan community in Singapore continues to showcase its heritage, as well as sustain its culture for future generations.
Gwee also specialises in dondang sayang, the improvisational, bantering performance of pantun (quatrains in Malay or Baba Malay), which is an important art form beloved by both the Malay and Peranakan communities.
For Gwee, Pileh Menantu was the start of a four-decade stage career as an actor, scriptwriter, director and dialogue coach for both wayang peranakan and dondang sayang. Answering a newspaper advertisement, Gwee auditioned and won a role in Pileh Menantu. Gwee then appeared as a nyonya matriarch on stage for the first time the following year, in 1985's Buang Keroh Pungot Jernih (Let Bygones be Bygones).
The play's producers, the Gunong Sayang Association (GSA), had been unable to find a suitable female actress to fill the role of the matriarch, leading Gwee to propose himself. Male actors playing female wayang peranakan roles had long been a tradition in the community, and Gwee's own father Peng Kwee had been a renowned pantun composer, dondang sayang singer and female impersonator in wayang peranakan from the early 20th century. By the 1980s however, wayang peranakan had not been performed in Singapore since the early 1960s, such that many people doubted that there were any male actors left who would be able to perform convincingly as matriarchs.
In every detail, a facet of heritage
Gwee's attention to detail proved invaluable for his performances. He silenced the naysayers with his recreation of the coiffure (such as the sanggul, a tightly coiled hair bun), costume (such as the baju panjang or long dress) and jewellery, as well as the precise, at times cutting speech and mannerisms of these bibiks. At the Victoria Theatre in March 1985, and for all his subsequent roles in the following decades, Gwee demonstrated his capacity to â€œtransform to the fullestâ€, under his chosen stage name of G. T. Lye.
Most wayang peranakan plays feature domestic settings and everyday environments, and reflects Peranakan social and cultural values. To fulfil his matriarch roles, Gwee drew on his personal memories and observations of â€œthe rich, the poor, the good, the bad, the ugly, the scandalousâ€ personalities that had passed through his childhood home. â€œ(From) the age of 11, I have always opened my eyes and ears to the beautiful hairdos, the crispy (sic) baju panjang, the beautiful kasut manek (beaded slippers)â€, he recalled.
The complex social interactions and hierarchical signifiers between women in the Peranakan community were absorbed by Gwee as well. â€œ(The matriarchs) are very fastidious (in) the way they speak, the way they deliver the language and who they are speaking to. It differs from one matriarch to anotherâ€, said Gwee.
Gwee's meticulous study of an earlier generation of nyonya matriarchs or bibiks yielded invaluable insights into an already vanishing way of life. As he observed: â€œI have experienced life with these kinds of peopleâ€¦ I am delivering something that you cannot see (regardless of) how (much) money you pay... it's all in the past, the genuine characters which nowadays, because of modernisation, you won't be able to see ever again.â€
Moreover, the art forms of wayang peranakan and Peranakan dondang sayang are traditionally performed in Baba Malay, and a high level of fluency and a quick wit is required in order to engage in the light-hearted verbal sparring or repartee which it entails. With Baba Malay incorporating Malay, Hokkien and other Chinese dialects, these art forms have helped build bridges of deeper understanding between communities. As Gwee says: ""For centuries, the Malay and the Peranakan communities have been able to communicate with each other in a beautiful and harmonious way â€“ not just through daily conversations but also through our music, poems and literary texts.â€
A living legacy
In the late 1980s, Gwee performed regularly with a professional wayang troupe in Melaka, further honing his craft and depth of cultural knowledge. Over the next four decades, he participated in 23 wayang peranakan productions throughout the region in various capacities, including scriptwriting (such as in 2000's Chuy It Chap Goh, the first script penned by Gwee) or as a language consultant.

Gwee also became a familiar face on Malay television and in dondang sayang acts, including appearing alongside stage veterans Momo Latiff and Hyrul Anwar in 2010's Kelab Dondang Sayang, as part of the Esplanade's Pesta Raya Malay Festival of Arts. He has also performed dondang sayang in a number of Peranakan wedding performances around the world, working in collaboration with STB to promote Peranakan culture in cities like Paris, Chengdu and Seoul. Gwee also continues to sustain wayang peranakan by mentoring young performers, such as skit performers from the Chitty Melaka association, and sharing knowledge with researchers.
Through these efforts, Gwee's deep cultural knowledge has been passed on to a new generation through his assiduous mentorship. Ivan Heng, founder and artistic director of theatre company Wild Rice expressed appreciation for Gwee's commitment to nurturing future generations of artists and audiences through his interviews, workshops and rehearsals. Similarly, Alvin Teo, president of the Gunung Sayang Association, has credited Gwee's in-depth knowledge of Peranakan culture and practices as integral to recreating wayang peranakan.
John Teo, former General Manager of the Peranakan Museum and current Deputy Director of Research at the National Heritage Board, summed up Gwee's accomplishments: â€œUnlike Peranakans of (the post-independence) generation, who are now trying to rediscover aspects of our heritage, he has lived the culture. His mentorship and guidance have been invaluable assets to the museum and its curators. In our collective efforts to preserve Singapore's intangible cultural heritage, G. T. is one of last remaining authorities, an irreplaceable expository agent of the customs, traditions and practices of a bygone era.â€

MuseSG Volume 5 Issue 3 â€“ Jul to Sep 2012
Treasure of the Aga Khan Museum: Architecture in Islamic Arts explored concepts of architecture and decoration in Islamic cultures through marvellous paintings, metalwork, ceramics and architectural elements. Itto offer insights into Islamic civilisations and their art and, in the process, foster knowledge and better understanding between Islamic societies and other cultures. The exhibition featured over a hundred works of art from various periods in the Islamic world spanning across Iran, India, Turkey, Syria, Spain, Egypt and China. All works of art were drawn from the collection of the Aga Khan Museum, which opened in 2014 in Toronto, Canada. Leading to the opening of the new museum, this exhibition travelled to three venues: the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg; the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur; and the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM).
At the ACM, the exhibition was divided into five sections that explored different concepts of space in religious and secular environments. Fortress and the City encompassed forts and fortified towns; Sacred Topographies used drawings and certificates to explore sites and monuments of Islamic pilgrimage; Religious and Funerary Architecture examined the importance of mosques and shrines; The Palace looked at the residences and lifestyles of royal courts; and, finally, Gardens, Pavilions and Tents discussed the importance of outdoor aesthetics and being close to nature.
Dr Pedro Moura Carvalho, Chief Curator at the ACM and lead curator of this exhibition, restructured the exhibition from its arrangement at the previous venues to put greater emphasis on these five themes. The exhibition gave visitors an opportunity to learn more about Islamic manuscript paintings, in particular, and to understand more of the diverse Islamic artistic traditions. Visitors who saw the exhibition at the previous venues would have been delighted to find the same works of art reinterpreted in Singapore.

Fortress and The City
The exhibition began by looking at the concept of fortified towns and medieval landscape development through paintings and various architectural elements. Images of forts, towns, enclosures, citadels and shrines are represented in the painting traditions of Ottoman Turkey (1299 - 1923), Safavid Iran (1501 - 1722) and Mughal India (1526 - 1858). Towns and palaces protected by tall walls and majestic gates often appear on the horizon in paintings. The scenes tend to be shown from a bird's-eye view, which enabled the painter to depict a large fortress in the limited space of a painting. Very often they were created from the imagination of the painter rather than from direct observation. These imagined fortified structures enhance the grandeur and awe of fabled towns and emphasise the city's impenetrability against hostile forces. Other paintings on display show urban landscapes depicting people, markets, houses, mosques and shrines inside towns.

Sacred Topographies
The Kaaba in the Masjid al-Haram (sacred enclosure) at Mecca stands at the heart of Islam. It provides the focus for the orientation of prayer and for the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that is a duty of every Muslim, provided they have the means and good health to do so. Other major pilgrimage sites include the Mosque of the Prophet at Medina, and the shrine of the Imam Reza in Mashhad, Iran. Representations of the Kaaba and other pilgrimage sites in manuscripts, manuals and certificates, and on ceramics were made as keepsakes for pilgrims and, in some cases, for verification purposes. In this section of the exhibition, the works of art are displayed in a stunning cubic structure which is five metres tall by five metres wide. This cube offers an intimate and serene space to view objects related to the hajj. Just as the Kaaba at Mecca stands at the heart of Islam, the cube aims to invoke a sense of the sacred topography and stands at the very centre of the exhibition gallery.

Religious and Funerary Architecture
The practice of Islam does not require specific buildings for worship or to commemorate the dead. As long as they orient themselves towards Mecca, Muslims may pray in their own home or outdoors. Nevertheless, people have always turned to architecture to monumentalise their faith and to commemorate their dead. As a result, mosques, tombs and shrines represent some of the greatest monuments built in Islamic lands. The mosque is a space for ritual prayer and stands at the heart of Muslim religious life, while tombs and shrines became the focus of pious visitation. Works of art in this section highlight the rich adornment of such architectures through paintings, textiles, ceramics and carved wooden beams, many of which are inscribed with Qur'anic verses, as well as complex floral and geometric patterns.

The Palace
The grand appearance of palaces, both inside and out, was intended to magnify the aura of kingship and create awe in visitors and residents alike. These magnificent structures often exhibit the artistic and architectural creativity of local traditions. In paintings, palace scenes tend to depict the courtly pleasures of feasting, hospitality, performing arts and music in richly ornamented interiors. Decorative ceramics, painted stucco, textiles, along with carved stone and wood can be seen in painted representations of palace life, which suggests a luxurious taste for aesthetic beauty.

Gardens, Pavilions, and Tents
Gardens are often referred to as an earthly version of the paradise promised in the Qur'an. Surah al-Rahman (Qur'an 55, on â€œThe Mercifulâ€) mentions a paradise that includes gardens, pavilions, carpets, flowing springs, evergreen trees and fruits. Many early Muslim rulers hailed from arid lands, such as the desert of Arabia, North Africa and parts of Iran and central Asia. Perhaps because of this barren heritage, they developed a keen interest in garden cultivation, water irrigation and appreciation of nature. Permanent and temporary structures like outdoor pavilions and tents were used to bring people and their affairs into closer proximity with nature. The use of tents and carpets not only enhanced the beauty of the natural environment, they were essential for dynasties such as the Timurids, for whom they were reminders of their nomadic past. As a result, courtly audiences and ceremonies in pavilions and tents are commonly depicted in manuscript paintings from the 15th century onwards.
Among the highlights of the exhibition are pages from the Shahnama, the epic historical poem written by the Persian poet Firdawsi in the late 10th century, and reproduced in marvellous illustrated editions. A folio produced for the Safavid king, Shah Tahmasp (1514 - 1576), is one of the most celebrated works in the Islamic world; pages from it are on display, along with other manuscript paintings and folios. There is a rare 18th-century hajj certificate with an inscription that includes the name of the surrogated pilgrim and the requestor. Architectural elements are also featured, such as a muqarnas from late 15th or 16th century Spain, ornamental doors from 15th-century Timurid Iran and 16th-century Iznik tiles from Turkey. Other works of art â€“ in ceramic, metal, stone, wood, and painted or drawn on parchment and paper â€“ present an overview of the artistic accomplishments of Islamic civilisations from the Iberian Peninsula to China.
His Highness The Aga Khan and The Aga Khan Development Network
His Highness the Aga Khan, founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network, is the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims as of 2012. In the context of his hereditary responsibilities, His Highness the Aga Khan has been deeply engaged with development and education in Asia and Africa for more than 50 years.
The Aga Khan Development Network is a group of private, non-denominational agencies working to improve the quality of life for people in many parts of the developing world.
This exhibition was held in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, one of the agencies in the Development Network. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture focuses on culture as a means of enhancing the physical, social and economic revitalisation of communities in the Islamic world. Some of its programmes include the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme, the Music Initiative in Central Asia and the upcoming project â€“ the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto.

Welcome to Our Home
Welcome to the home of Hock Seng and his granddaughter, Nadine. This is Hock Seng's usual home, but for Nadine, it's only her â€œfor nowâ€ home. It's May 2020, and in the midst of the many other firsts in Singapore â€“ the first time all playgrounds are closed, the first time it is essential to wear masks while outdoors â€“ is the first May school holidays. 
Nadine's parents both have to be at work for long hours, and they thought letting Nadine spend time with her Gong Gong would be the best for the whole family during this period. So, here we are!
Psst! This chapter's artist is Jeanette Yap, also known as jhawnette. She loves drawing people, experimenting with different compositions, and playing with colour. Be sure to feed Chatbird before you leave this page! He's waiting at the bottom right corner of your screen.
A Rainy Day to Remember
Nadine has spent many days and nights at Gong Gong's home by now, and yet she hasn't run out of questions to ask him! Her latest interest is the one grandparent she has no memories of â€“ her Po Po (â€œgrandmotherâ€ in Mandarin), who passed away many years ago. Nadine wants to know what Po Po was like, what her hobbies and favourite foods were. Most of all, Nadine wants to knowâ€¦
The 1968 National Day Parade was a memorable one for many. The theme that year was â€œRugged Societyâ€, and indeed, participants and spectators alike had to grit their teeth and carry on with the parade that year as showers cascaded on them.
â€œThe lightning flashed and thunder cracked, then it poured. Soon we were soaked to the skin. We could not see what was happening at the City Hall as it was misty and blurry. We just obeyed the commands. We moved forward into the muddy and soggy Padang. Once out of the Padang, we tried stamping harder to get rid of the mud stuck on our shoes. Later, we learnt that we had gone through eight kilometres in the pouring rain.â€

National Day for the State of Singapore
The 1968 NDP wasn't the first rainy National Day Parade we had. In fact, on what was supposed to be Singapore's first National Day Parade several years earlier, it had rained so much that the parade got postponed! The scene at the Padang was vividly described in the newspapers â€“ â€œThe Padang was a lake after hours of rainâ€, and â€œthe croaking of frogs filled the airâ€. 
Do you know the date of that first parade? It wasn't on the 9th of August! It was on 3 June 1960, a year after Singapore had achieved full internal self-governance. We weren't an independent nation yet, so the first-day covers (commemorative envelopes that are decorated with postmarks and a special set of stamps) had the words â€œState of Singaporeâ€ inked on them.

The Second First NDP
On 9 August 1966, Singapore had her second first NDP â€“ or her true first NDP after independence. On that day, 23,000 participants took part in the 90-minute National Day Parade, which carried the theme â€œNational Pride and Confidence in the Futureâ€.

As the first-day cover reflects, we were now the â€œRepublic of Singaporeâ€! Interestingly, the words â€œNational Dayâ€ are not explicitly used, unlike on the 1960 first-day cover. In 1966, both â€œIndependence Dayâ€ and â€œNational Dayâ€ were used by different organisations before the Singapore Government announced on 5 August 1966 that Singapore's anniversary as an independent nation should be called â€œNational Dayâ€.
Both first-day covers are featured in our Singapore History Gallery at the National Museum, and together with other artefacts, they tell a story of Singapore's journey towards independence.

Metal
Gift of Tan Lee Kheng
This badge features a crescent and five stars, representing Singapore's national flag. Based on the year inscribed, it is likely to be a souvenir issued in commemoration of Singapore's first National Day.
The then-Minister for Culture S. Rajaratnam explained the symbolism of the crescent and five stars at the Legislative Assembly session on 11 November 1959:
""The crescent moon signifies a country eternally young. This is expressive of one of the essential qualities of our people, for not only are our people physically young but they are also young in spirit and outlookâ€¦ The new Singaporeâ€¦ finds its inspirations in what it hopes to do in the future rather than what it has done in the pastâ€¦ It is only the youthful who are more conscious of the future waiting to unfold before them.
The five stars represent the ideals on which the new State of Singapore is founded â€“ democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality.""

The mobile column (a parade of the hardware owned by Singapore's defence forces) featured 18 of Singapore's newly acquired AMX-13 light tanks. Singapore was the first in the region to acquire these tanks.
Land Rovers fitted with L6 Weapon of Magnesium Battalion Anti-Tank (WOMBAT) 120mm recoilless rifles formed part of the mobile column which made its debut at the National Day Parade in 1969

3. 1970
The first flypast was at the 1970 parade
â€œJust before 9.09 a.m. the air was charged with restrained excitement as Cabinet Ministers and school cadets alike kept glancing from wristwatch to sky. Then ears pricked at a faint whirring sound coming from the Singapore Recreation Club end of the Padang. Heads turned as if in unison and ears strained into the clear blue sky. And the specks began to appear above the Beach Road War Memorial as the whirring grew louder.
An excited murmur rose from the waiting crowd. The specks became three Alouettes of the Air Defence Command of the SAF. The national flag had seldom fluttered higher than it did slung beneath the leading helicopter 300 feet up in the wind. Then nine silvery Strikemasters zoomed past in perfect V-formation, with bright sunlight glinting on their wings. Barely seconds â€“ and they were past. Eyes strained after them till they were mere specks again in the distance.â€

4. 1976
The NDP was held at the National Stadium for the first time, three years after the opening of the Stadium in 1973. There were 18 NDPs held at the Stadium before its closure and demolition in 2007 and 2010 respectively.

5. 1984
The first NDP song, â€œStand up for Singaporeâ€, was launched. The song was written to mark 25 years of nation-building for Singapore, from self-governance in 1959.
The original lyrics of the first verse of â€œStand Up for Singaporeâ€ were:
â€œIn 25 years we've come so far
In building up this nation
People working hard have made us what we are
In just one generation
We owe a lot to Singapore
There's much we can be thankful for
But now's the time to give back something more
We've got to stand up, stand up for Singaporeâ€
6. 1996
This parade marked the first time the parachute displays were done by a team known as the Red Lions. There had previously been parachute performances, beginning from the 1970s, but this was first time the Singapore Armed Forces Parachute Team performed under the official name and identity of the â€œRed Lionsâ€.

This was the first time that the NDP was held in front of â€œCity Hallâ€ and at the National Stadium at the same time! A replica of City Hall was created as part of the backdrop at the National Stadium, and the popular National Day song â€œHomeâ€ was also introduced at this NDP.

Ask Someone! Do you remember watching or participating in a National Day Parade or big celebratory event? What did you see, hear, and even smell? How did you feel?
With Heartland Soul
Back at home, as Gong Gong reaches for his newspapers, Nadine asks him, â€œWhy do you read the big paper news? Isn't it difficult to hold? Appa (dad in Tamil) reads the news on his iPad!â€
Gong Gong explains that he likes the smell of ink, and the feel of each page crinkling under his thumbs and fingers. Gong Gong asks Nadine if she'd like to join him in reading the news today, and together they find outâ€¦
The National Day Parade was first de-centralised in 1975, Singapore's 10th birthday. The idea was to allow as many people as possible to join in the celebrations. There were â€œpocket pageantsâ€ at 13 NDP centres including Toa Payoh Sports Complex, Maxwell Road, Bukit Panjang, and Paya Lebar, among others. These parades were held throughout the day, with different ministers as Guests of Honour at different locations.
The day was beautifully summarised in The Straits Times the following day â€“ â€œThe celebrations began in an after-breakfast rain, continued in mellow afternoon sunshine that came racing out of cloudy skies and ended in a brilliant firework display at night.â€ (The Straits Times, 10 August 1975, pg. 1)

Sing, Singapore
As Gong Gong and Nadine finish reading the news for the day, Nadine asks, â€œGong Gong, do you think there will be a new National Day song this year? What's your favourite National Day song? Can we sing our favourite songs together? Please?â€ Gong Gong laughs â€“ every time Nadine speaks, he can almost see the question marks â€“ and nods.
Gong Gong says his favourite is â€œWe Are Singaporeâ€ because the lyrics are so stirring â€“ â€œThis is my country, this is my flag! This is my future, this is my life!â€
Nadine asks, â€œGong Gong, what is stirring? You mean the song is about soup?â€ Gong Gong replies with a twinkle in his eye, â€œIt's not about soup, but you're right, in a way! Just imagine that your heart is like soup, and singing the song makes your heart feel different.â€
Nadine likes â€œLove at First Lightâ€ because there's a young girl singing in the song â€“ â€œShe's a kid like me!â€ âˆ’ but she also likes the feeling she gets when she hears about â€œsunny daysâ€ and â€œstars twinklingâ€. Even while at home during the May holidays, she can see these lights.
After listening to both songs, Nadine asks Gong Gong (again!) if they could sing one more song together â€“ â€œHomeâ€. She remembers how just last month, people â€“ including Gong Gong and herself â€“ were singing it from their homes.
Ask Someone! What is your favourite song or poem about Singapore, or about your home? Why do you like it?

Special Exhibition Gallery
Across the world, the epithet â€œLittle Indiaâ€ has come to connote an enclave or a microcosm with a concentration of Indian and South Asian communities. It is a locale that mirrors the cultural diversity of the migrant community; a focal point for immigrants in search of kinsmen and communal interaction; and a symbol of transnational identity and ethnic consciousness.
The Indian Heritage Centre's Once Upon a Time in Little India special exhibition told the story of Singapore's Little India through historical and contemporary lenses using archival images, historical artefacts and contemporary art. It also examined congregations in Indian community spaces around Singapore from the early 19th to the late 20th centuries, and surveyed similar settlements across many parts of the world as symptomatic of global movements of the Indian and larger South Asian diasporas.
The exhibition, as a parallel project of the Singapore Biennale 2016, also featured three contemporary art installations which were commissioned by the Indian Heritage Centre for the exhibition and are reflective of the artists' experiences or memories of Little India.
This digital archive of the Once Upon a Time in Little India exhibition features ten stories presented in the exhibition. The exhibition has also been catalogued in the publication Once Upon a Time in Little India published by the Indian Heritage Centre.

Little India Today
Around the World
The Indian diaspora is the complex product of large scale movement and settlement during the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of colonial migration and post-colonial dispersion although Indians were engaged in trade and cultural exchanges with the rest of the world since pre-colonial times. Today, the Indian diaspora is estimated at over 28 million and comprises the former labour workforce of the colonial era to the information technology, financial and transient workforce of present times.
As the Indian community migrated and settled across different parts of the world, they brought with them ideas and concepts, values and beliefs, social and cultural norms. The concept of a â€œLittle Indiaâ€ as a microcosm of Indian culture also travelled with the diaspora. Embodied in ethnic enclaves found in many parts of the world, these Little Indias of the world offer everything Indian from food to fashion, art to music, film to faith etc.
A mapping of the global Indian diaspora across the world is presented here. Some of the more well known examples of Indian settlements around the world are found in Canada, Fiji, Guyana, Indonesia, Mauritius, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the UK and the USA.
This map of the Indian diaspora across the world is based on statistics from various censuses and reports of the countries included in this map. All information was correct as at the time of exhibition launch in 2016.

















Around Singapore
In Singapore, the earliest concentration of Indians was the Indian Sepoy lines located at the foot of Fort Canning Hill and its surroundings. Between 1819 and 1867, Indian settlement was concentrated within the Singapore Town area, with spillage onto the Serangoon Road area.
In addition to the above settlements there were other areas of congregation which were closely linked to the occupations of the Indian community. For instance, the Chulia kampung (known as Kling Street and later as Chulia Street) and Market Street areas were areas of congregation for early traders and private financier communities.
Dhoby Ghaut, as the name suggests, was likewise a place where Indian washermen at the Stamford Canal area converged and congregated, while port and railway workers could be found at Tanjong Pagar and textile merchants at High Street and Arab Street. Sembawang was another area where Naval Base employees lived and worked as late as the 1960s.
Over time, most of the aforesaid areas evolved and underwent dramatic transformations as the nation progressed. With the exception of Serangoon Road, these areas no longer bear any evidence of Indian settlement today.
The Little India Precinct
Bounded by Serangoon and Sungei Roads and Jalan Besar, the Little India precinct spans 13 hectares and is home to 900 conserved buildings. The precinct's arterial thoroughfare, Serangoon Road, is one of the earliest roads built in Singapore. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the precinct was associated with agricultural activity, brick making, lime quarrying and cattle rearing. The Indian community started to settle in the area back in the 1820s when they were employed to work at the brick kilns and later in the cattle trade. During the 1840s, the construction and operation of the Race Course attracted more members of the Indian community to settle and work in the area.
Despite the predominance of the Indian community, the Little India precinct was also a reflection of Singapore's cosmopolitan society as Europeans, Eurasians, Chinese and Malays also establishedbusinesses in the area. The precinct's ethnic diversity is perhaps best reflected in its diverse street names which include Sunnambu Kambam (â€œlime villageâ€ in Tamil), Kandang Kerbau (â€œcattle pensâ€ in Malay) and Nan Sheng Hua Yuen Pien (â€œFringe of Garden in the Southâ€ in Mandarin).
The settlement of the Indian community started from Dhoby Ghaut and Selegie Road at one end, spanned Serangoon Road and ended at Potong Pasir. It also included other peripheral areas such as Balestier Road. From the years following World War II to the present, the Little India precinct has transformed itself into a commercial centre catering to the needs of the Indian community.

Albert Street
Albert Street was once the location for Theemithi (or â€œfire walkingâ€ in Tamil) which is one of the two oldest Hindu festivals in Singapore. The street was known as Thimiri Thidal (or â€œthe place where people tread on fireâ€ in Tamil) to Indians. In 1870, Theemithi was relocated to the Sri Mariamman Temple at South Bridge Road.
The festival was introduced in Singapore by the caulker community, who specialised in boat building and who traced their roots to the seaside Cuddalore and Poigainallur areas in South India. They brought with them the cult of Draupadi, a Tamil folk goddess associated with the Mahabarata, an Indian epic. They owned businesses along the Kallang River and lived in the Jalan Sultan and North Bridge Road areas. To this day, the caulker community remain closely associated with the Sri Mariamman Temple.
""They managed the fire pit, the firewalking ceremony, and the physical act of starting the fireâ€¦all were managed by members of the boat caulkers' community.""
â€“ As recounted by Soundara Rajan to the National Archives for Communities of Singapore on 17th December, 1987

Sunnambu Kambam
In the 19th century, due to the location of government lime pits and brick kilns, the Serangoon Road area was known as Sunnambu Kambam or Kampong Kapor (â€œlime villageâ€ in Tamil and Malay respectively). The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, built in 1855, was originally called the Sunnambu Kambam Kovil (â€œLime Village Templeâ€ in Tamil) and patronised mainly by daily rated workers. The temple's trustees were mandores (â€œoverseersâ€ in Malay) and included Govinda Mandore and MK Andiappa Mandore.
The Sri Narasingha Perumal Temple (now known as Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple) was also built in 1855, by Vaishnavite (followers of Vishnu) merchants. By 1907, the temple came under the administration of the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowments Board. As a result of its spacious grounds, the temple was the site for Thaipusam celebrations and devotees would assemble their kavadis on these grounds before walking to the Sri Thendayuthapani temple at Tank Road.
""The temple is the most important structure among all temporal things needed for social order in a socially constructed society (the uur or â€œvillageâ€). Buffalo Road and Norris Road, falling into the geographical framework of the â€˜uur' had the Kaliamman temple as its centre. The temple was referred to as the Sunnambu Kambam Kaliamman Koil (â€œthe Kali temple at the lime kiln villageâ€ in Tamil). Over time, the area attractedmore Indians, especially the Tamils.â€
â€“ As narrated by A Mani in A Tale of Two Streets: Urban Renewal, Transnationalisation and Reconstructed memories
Published In Enchanting Asian Social Landscapes
Thannir Kambam
Thannir Kambam (â€œWater Villageâ€ in Tamil) comprises the Balestier area from where water was sent to town for sale. The Thannir Kambam Kovil or Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple was established by Tamils living in Potong Pasir and later handed over to the management of B Govindasamy Chettiar, the proprietor of Indian Labour Company and, subsequently, to his son-in-law SL Perumal. Located at the junction of Serangoon Road, Balestier and Race Course Road, the temple and its wells were frequented by Indians in the surrounding areas.
The area was also known as Recreation Road to Europeans due to the number of recreation clubs located in the vicinity. The Singapore Indian Association, the Ceylon Sports Club and the Khalsa Association at the Balestier Plain organised sporting activities and social gatherings while the former Kamala Club was a premier institution for South Asian women.

Desker Road
Desker Road was named after Andre Felipe Desker, better known as Henry Desker, one of Singapore's first butchers. Desker was an Eurasian of Portuguese descent and his butchery was situated between Norris Road and Veerasamy Road. He also owned properties between Cuff Road and Sungei Road.
The Desker family had strong associations with the St. Joseph's Church at Victoria Street and Henry Desker and his son Hermogenes Desker (better known as Armenisgild Stanislaus Desker) were active in the Church's leadership and donated generously to major Catholic institutions.
For Sale Mutton
""The undersigned have this day commenced business as Butchers, intending to furnish the residents with a regular supply of the best Mutton; they will keep constantly on hand a large stock of Gram fed, Bengal and Patna, Sheep and can therefore supply promptly all orders with which they may be favoured. Circulars will be sent round regularly.

Kandang Kerbau
Kandang Kerbau (â€œcattle pensâ€ in Malay) was the name given to the buffalo settlement established in 1835 on Serangoon Road. Buffalo Road, Kerbau Road and Kerbau Lane, and Lembu Road are place names that point to the presence of cattle trade in the area. Cattle traders such as IR Belilios, a Venetian Jew, and Moona Khader Sultan, a Tamil Muslim from the French territory of Karaikal were well known personalities in the area.
The erstwhile Kandang Kerbau (or KK) Market (now Tekka Market), the KK Police Station, KK Hospital and KK Post Office were important landmarks in the area. In the mid-20th century, the road was filled with traditional goldsmiths from South India. It was also the location of the residences of the â€œtoddy kingâ€ and contractor O Ramasamy Nadar. VK Kalyanasundaram of Thiruvarur also started his textile business at Buffalo Road and later owned stores at Dunlop Street and Serangoon Road before closing down in the late 1980s.
""A couple of months ago I went to Serangoon Road, where Tekka Marketâ€”a sprawling structureâ€”was abuzz with activity. The colour was breath taking, as customers haggled over prices, prodded the merchandise and complained sorely about the rising cost of living. It looked like sheer mayhem. But that was the way it had always beenâ€”alive.â€

Campbell Lane
Campbell Lane has borne witness to the beginnings of several veteran Indian entrepreneurial giants. P Govindasamy Pillai, widely known as PGP, was a successful businessman and owner of the landmark PGP stores, the first of which was established at Campbell Lane. When he first arrived, PGP was attached to Gnanapragasam Pillai, who was a spice and grain trader from Pondicherry with businesses located at 44 and 46 Serangoon Road.
PGP was a Justice of the Peace, a founder member of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and a well-known philanthropist who donated to temples including the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple. During the 1960s, enterprising peddlers such as Mustaq Ahmad (now Managing Director of Mohammed Mustafa & Samsuddin Co); OK Mohamed Haniffa (now Chairman of Haniffa Textiles); and Ramachandra Murugaia (now proprietor of Jothi Flower Shop) also set up their respective textile and flower selling businesses along Campbell Lane.
""They were very prominent business people in Little India in those days. Everyone knew who PGP was. They were (dealing in) very fine textiles. They had a very good provision shop. It was a place of attraction, shoppers' attraction. And it is sad that they are no longer in Little India. Business environment changes so fast and if you are not adapting to the change, there is a fall out because of the change.""

Dunlop Street
Known as Rangasamy Road prior to 1870, Dunlop Street was probably named after Colonel Samuel Dunlop, Inspector General of Police of the Straits Settlements. However, the street could also have been named after AE Dunlop, who was the secretary and an active member of the Race Course Committee.
Dunlop Street was the locus of the Hindustani community and it was known as Mangal Singh ki gali, after Baboo Mangal Singh, a cattle trader from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh and a respected member of the community. To the Chinese, it was better known as Yi Li Xiang, after a famous Teochew puppet troupe which was located here and along Madras Street in the late 1950s.
Funded by trader Shaik Abdul Gaffoor bin Shaik Hyder, the construction of Masjid Abdul Gafoor in 1910 on land that originally belonged to the Al-Abrar Mosque contributed to the multi-ethnic nature of the area. The mosque served as a focal point for Tamil Muslims and Boyanese residents of the nearby Kampong Boyan.
""The Swami Sharvananda will deliver a lecture in Hindi on Sanatana Dharma at Baboo Mangal Singh's residence, Dunlop Street, on Wednesday, the 12th inst,. At 8 p.m. sharp. All Hindi speaking public are welcome.""

Birch Road
Birch Road is named after JWW Birch, the first British Resident of Perak. The shop houses constructed between 1910â€“1930 at Birch Road and Race Course Lane are conserved landmarks under the Jalan Besar Conservation Area.
Between 1890 and 1898, the Masjid Angullia (also known as the Serangoon Road Mosque) was built at the junction of Birch Road and Serangoon Road. The mosque was named after the late Mohammed Salleh Eussoof Angullia, a Gujerati Muslim trader and property investor from Rander as well as the proprietor of MSE Angullia and Co. His son, Ahmed Mohamed Salleh, was also a prominent trader, a Justice of the Peace and Municipal Commissioner who resided in the Orchard Road area and had Angullia Park named after him.
""Asfar as I can remember, there was a mosque at the back, attap mosque, now they had turned out to a very beautiful brick mosque, there was a Malay kampong, opposite in front of our house there was a big field where the races run, and lots of trees. Of course, it is not only a race course, it is also a golf course and off days you get all the boys including myself playing football and running about in that particular field, the race course.â€

Selegie Road
Selegie Road was once known as Nagappan Thanki (â€œNagappan's Water Tankâ€ in Tamil) after Nagappan, the man who used to sell water to the public and Tek Kia Kha (â€œThe Foot of The Small Bamboosâ€ in Hokkien).
Selegie Road was also the location of the former press and offices of Tamil Murasu, the media arm of the Tamils Reform Association (TRA). In response, the rival Singapore Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (SDMK) at Norris Road published Kolgai Muzhakkam to air their differing views.
Thamizhavel G Sarangapany was the editor of Tamil Murasu and he was inspired by the philosophy of the Self Respect Movement spearheaded by EV Ramasamy Naicker. Through Tamil Murasu, he championed societal reform, literacy, modernisation of the Tamils and encouraged the celebration of secular festivals such as Tamizhar Thirunal (â€œTamils Festivalâ€ in Tamil).
""At that time (1951) it was in a shophouse at Selegie Road, that building is now Peace Centre. It was a shophouse, on the ground floor where the editor seated at a corner in a small table ... And at the space facing the editor was a printing machine, which printed Tamil Murasu. The curious thing about it was Tamil Murasu at that time was also running an English daily which was a morning newspaper. The English daily was called Indian Daily Mail. That English daily had one editor and Tamil Murasu had two sub-editors and when I joined, I was third.â€

Race Course Road
Race Course Road was named after the old race course which was located here in the 1840s. The races attracted a cosmopolitan audience including Europeans, Malays and Indians; the Tamil travelogue Athivinotha Kuthirai Panthaya Lavani by Rengasamy Dasan provides a descriptive account of his journey from India to Singapore to watch the races. Farrer Park was also witness to several historic events including the flying of the first aeroplane in 1911; the surrender ceremony of prisoners of war after the Fall of Singapore; and the historic address of Subhas Chandra Bose in 1943.
In 1950, the foundation stone of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hall (MGMH) was laid at Race Course Lane, in commemoration of Mahatma Gandhi, and the building was completed in 1953, through funds raised by the local Indian community. The Netaji Hindi High School was also set up in a club house on Race Course Lane in 1948 and conducted classes until the 1970s. The century old Singapore Malayalee Association, the oldest Malayalee organisation outside India, is also located at Race Course Road.
""And also 1919, the first aeroplane Singaporeans had ever seen came to Singapore, piloted by Mr Smith â€¦ landed at the present spot where Farrer Park is. Farrer Park, it was an old race course, the centre there, the plane landed â€¦ and of course I never missed the opportunity to go up to that spot â€¦ to Race Course to see what an aeroplane is like.""

Norris Road and Rangoon Road
Norris Road was home to the first premises of the Ramakrishna Mission in Singapore. The Ramakrishna Mission Orchestra, founded in 1939 by Dr. Chotta Singh, a Hindustani medical doctor, was Singapore's first classical Indian music orchestra. A decade later, the Indian Fine Arts Society (now Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society) was established at Rangoon Road. Amongst the society's more prominent members were pioneer performer-teachers of Carnatic music including Pandit Ramalingam, MV Gurusamy, Retnam and S Gopalakrishnan.
In 1949, the first Indian music band, New Indian Amateur Orchestra, was established by Edmund Appau and V Sinniah. The band eventually evolved into the Singapore Indian Music Party (SIMP) and its primary repertoire was film music. Bands such as SIMP would perform at the Tamizhar Thirunal (â€œTamils Festivalâ€ in Tamil) celebrations, temple festivals or even weddings ceremonies. The band rehearsed at the residences of Edmund Appau at Short Street, Race Course and Rangoon Road, and at a clubhouse on Norris Road. Edmund Appau's daughter, Christina Edmund was Singapore's first recorded Tamil singer.

Little India Today
Today, Little India continues to be the locus of Singapore's Indian community with members of the community visiting the thriving neighbourhood to buy and eat everything Indian, partake in religious festivals, and participate in activities organised by community associations. It is also the site where South Asian transient workers congregate en masse on weekends for social interactions, recreation and everyday activities such as grocery shopping, money transfers etc.
For tourists and locals alike, an experience of Little India is not complete without a tour to take in the sights, sounds and smells of the precinct. Equipped with stories of the past and present from the exhibition, one can explore the neighbourhood on foot, meet its residents, survey its shophouse architecture and landmarks, and sample the cuisines it has to offer.

History is often about presenting perspectives, and the individuals and authorities involved in producing historical accounts have different ways of describing and interpreting past events. However, history is rarely written for the mere sake of recording the past. Rather, the importance of history lies in how it serves to explain (and legitimise) conditions in the present.
When documenting historical events, historians are influenced by the complex interplay of sources as well as personal and/or institutional interests. To obtain a more holistic understanding of our past, it is important to look beyond dominant narratives, take into account history at the peripheries, adopt a multi-disciplinary approach and look at events through as many lenses as possible.
In this Singapore Bicentennial special exhibition, the Malay Heritage Centre adopts the themes of reflection and refraction as a pair of lenses to focus, clarify and contrast different perspectives. The exhibition showcases indigenous historical sources to provide counterpoints to Western perspectives and narratives of the Malay World.
In doing so, the centre hopes to present different and multiple sides of the story and to put things into perspective so that visitors can reflect on the arguments presented and draw their own conclusions.

Mapping the Malay Archipelago
Up until the 16th century, many of the early maps of the world were speculative and inaccurate, and as a result, early trade missions were often hazardous endeavours. On these early maps, Southeast Asia was represented as little known or unexplored formations and areas. However, with increased global trade, the accuracy of maps improved significantly and they became valuable navigation aids for various maritime powers.
By the 1500s, European maritime powers were relying on maps to explore commercial interests further â€˜east of the Indies' and places in Southeast Asia became increasingly important. The following maps show how Southeast Asia, and by extension, the Malay Archipelago, have been rendered by Asian, Islamic and European civilisations as well as indigenous communities at different points in history.

Mediums of Histories
Folktales, myths and legends often serve as origin stories of countries and communities. Singapura's origin story revolves around a prince whose curiosity led him to cross the sea, appease a sea-goddess and explore a deserted island - in the process sighting an extraordinary creature and establishing a new kingdom on the island.
In contrast to this mythical past, the official history of Singapore is pieced together from documents and records comprising treaties, surveys, government records, newspaper reports, photographs, public and private correspondences, and other ephemera from collections and archives in Europe.
Today, these documents and records as well as new archaeological findings continue to (re)inform the way Singapore's history is studied and (re)written while earlier Malay manuscripts, sources and material culture are often studied only at the margins of historical enquiry.
The following selection of artefacts and manuscripts bring the focus back to the latter and showcases how Malay manuscripts and sources often offer an alternative lens to better understand Singapore's past before and during the colonial period.

Melayu â€” Jawa: Order and Innovation
The paucity of archaeological and indigenous documentary evidence after Parameswara-Iskandar Shah fled Singapura as well as a climate change theory of a regional Little Ice Age between the 14th and 18th centuries suggest that Singapura experienced a decline during that period and bolsters the argument that the island was abandoned and played a limited role in the going-ons in the region until its revival by British colonial enterprise in the 19th century.
While this interpretation of Singapura's past is valid to a certain degree, Singapura still retained a symbolic significance in the feudal politics of the Malay kingdoms at the time. This is because successive Malay royal genealogies since Sang Nila Utama-Sri Tri Buana have relied on narratives of the founding and subsequent flight from Singapura to legitimise the establishment of later Malay kingdoms. Subsequent rulers of the various Malay kingdoms also played the diplomacy game, using means such as exchanging gifts, paying tribute and even brokering royal marriages to establish alliances and extend their influence vis-Ã -vis their rivals.
Singapura's economic importance as a collecting station and transit node in regional and international maritime routes of trade and exploration was renewed when it was incorporated into the new Johor-Riau kingdom in 1528. As contact with Western powers intensified from the 18th century onwards, the cultures and ways of life of indigenous Malay societies came under increasing scrutiny by Western social scientists and colonial administrators. These foreigners viewed and evaluated the Malay world through the lenses of Western civilisation, science and progress to such an extent that indigenous forms were generally deemed as inferior to those in the West.

Orang Atas Angin: Folk from Above the Winds
The arrival of Europeans in the Malay world is often presented as heralding a significant new chapter in the history of the region. In contrast, indigenous sources such as Malay manuscripts depict the arrival of the Europeans as a minor event within the expanded history of the Malay world.
In these indigenous sources, European arrivals are further identified not by their nationalities but by broad cultural identities such as â€œRumâ€, â€œPeringgiâ€, â€œOrang Putehâ€ etc. Collectively, the Europeans were described as hailing dari atas angin or â€œfrom above the windsâ€ (referring to countries that lay west to the Nusantara) and the term seeks less to identify the Europeans than to convey the position of the indigenous peoples vis-Ã -vis the Europeans.
The following prints highlight some of these early encounters between the indigenous groups in the Malay Archipelago and the Europeans, and showcase some of the literary archetypes of the latter who arrived in the region. These archetypes reflect the Malay community's own views and impressions towards foreigners and refracts the notion that the indigenous communities were unaware or had little opinion of these arrivals from the west.

Sites and Straits
The Malay world did not always exist as discrete and separate political territories. Up until the 19th century, the geographical boundaries of the Malay world were informed by its own political logic â€“ one where kingdoms, territories and people regularly shifted, in accordance with the waxing and waning of political influences within the Malay court.
The constant shift in geographical boundaries throughout the different periods is captured in cartographic and seafaring manuals from the region, in which borders are not fixed. Rather, various sites and straits are identified in order to facilitate and mirror movements through the region.
When the Dutch and the British arrived in the 18th century, they were required to refer to these indigenous sources in order to navigate the region â€“ but not before eventually dividing the Archipelago along colonial boundaries.
The following artefacts and images present different perspectives of Singapore according to both indigenous as well as colonial conceptions of space.

Polities and Forests
In 1849, Malacca-born writer Munshi Abdullah reflected on some of the changes in Singapore shortly after the arrival of the British: â€œForests have become nations, whilst [other] nations have become forestsâ€. These changes to the natural and physical environment arose in part due to the colonial impulse to survey, map and document the local flora and fauna. From the works of British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace to ethnographer Walter William Skeat, there are many examples of colonial studies into the naturistic realm of the Malay world.
However, as the various artefacts in this section show, knowledge of the natural environment was not the sole reserve of the European administration but also reflect indigenous attitudes towards and mastery of the natural environment, and how the colonial administration sometimes relied on and/or obscured such examples of indigenous expertise relating to flora, fauna and supernatural phenomena in order to assert European influence in the region.

Encountering the West
At the turn of the 18th century, Singapore was located in the heart of a power struggle that took place between the Dutch and the Malay world, as well as within the Malay court.
Within the Johor Sultanate, power was split between a faction led by the Bugis, and a faction led by other members of the court. This power struggle was complicated by the entry of Dutch and British forces into the region in the late 18th century, whose interests in the region manifested in the conquest of Malacca and parts of the Riau Islands, amongst other things.
Amidst this political landscape, Temenggong Abdul Rahman was said to have moved to Singapore in 1818 following a fall-out with Raja Ja'afar in Riau regarding the issue of colonial involvement in the region. It is within this context that the British East India Company, and Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore.

Tales of Our Shores
The establishment of a British trading post in Singapore in 1819, followed by the 1824 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance has foregrounded much of present-day understandings of trade, sovereignty and politics in Singapore. These treaties cemented Singapore's eventual position as a British colony while eclipsing Singapore's historical and cultural links to the wider Malay world.
Fortunately, these links are preserved in folk tales, literary manuscripts, documents and artefacts found across the Malay peninsula and Archipelago. Composed of both tangible and intangible mediums, the aforementioned historical sources also rarely remain unchanged over time, as new discoveries and insights are bound to emerge which may challenge and/or enrich one's understanding of history, and by extension, one's identity.
The Singapore Bicentennial offers Singaporeans with an opportunity to revisit inherited narratives and to refract these narratives through the lens of other perspectives â€“ in this case, perspectives from the Malay world. In this concluding section, artefacts from more recent times are featured in order to illustrate how history is still constantly being revisited, (re)presented, refracted and reinvented.

Introduction
Guo Pei: Chinese Art and Couture presents a dialogue between historical and contemporary Chinese design, juxtaposing 29 embroidered masterworks by China's foremost couturiÃ¨re with 20 Chinese art masterpieces in the Asian Civilisations Museum's collection. Guo Pei's dramatic, sculptural gowns reflect influences from growing up in Beijing surrounded by Chinese imperial art and mythology. Her creations also express her personal take on contemporary fashion and aesthetics.
Exploring her impact on everyday lives beyond the runway, many of Guo Pei's intricate Chinese bridal gowns â€“ including two directly inspired by artworks in the Asian Civilisations Museum's collection â€“ will be displayed for the first time. Serving as points of encounter and departure, the Asian Civilisations Museum's objects invite contemplation on how Guo Pei references and reimagines Chinese aesthetics and tradition for China and the world today.

Gold is the Colour of My Soul
Couture: The Spirit of Dedication and Devotion
As part of their training, the embroiderers at Rose Studio improve their skills by studying and reimagining embroideries of old â€“ like the thangka depicting the Buddha on a lotus (bottom left). Thangkas are embroidered textiles or paintings depicting Buddhist deities or scenes. The Buddha is depicted here in fine satin and stem stiches. Symbolising his enlightenment, he stands serenely on a lotus, rising above the turgid waters below. The laborious process required to produce such silk textiles produces merit for the makers, and those who donate money to make these for monasteries and temples.
Requiring 50,000 worker-hours to complete, Guo Pei regards this iconic masterpiece (bottom right) as a personal milestone. It symbolises her dedication and her desire to create the most beautiful dress possible without commercial considerations. Because of its technical mastery, it has been hailed as â€œthe birth of haute couture in China, â€¦a symbol of its timeâ€ by the China National Silk Museum in Hangzhou.
The stunning dress, made up of long, slim panels richly embroidered with designs of lotus and floral scrolls, radiates like the sun, corresponding to the theme of her first couture collection, Samsara (a concept of life cycles in some Asian religions). A key visual symbol of Buddhism in art, the lotus is associated with qualities like purity and harmony.

Reinventing Imperial Tradition
In Qing China, dress was governed by sumptuary laws that gave visual hierarchy and order to society. This style of robe is known as jifu (auspicious attire) and was reserved only for use by the emperor during ritual ceremonies and festive occasions like New Year's Day.
Symbols of absolute authority decorate the garment: the emperor is represented by nine dragons â€“ considered supreme of all beasts â€“ rising above and controlling the universe indicated by the swirling blue clouds (bottom left), waves, and mountains at the hem. Yellow is associated with earth, life, nourishment, and wearing this particularly bright shade (minghuang) was a privilege of the emperor, empress, and empress dowager.
Every Guo Pei collection since 2006 has featured striking yellow and gold creations. Her fondness for resplendent yellow, elaborate embroidery, and lavish silk reflects a love for designs, materials, and techniques associated with Chinese imperial art and style.
Guo Pei's splendid creations like this show her personal, joyous take on Qing Chinese imperial style. The sombre dragon robe has been reconceived into an informal, fun and frilly mini-dress with a long train. The dragons â€“ key emblems of power â€“ are replaced by the Chinese characters for happiness and good fortune. But strong parallels remain in its design: the choice of bright yellow; the symmetrical composition; the placement of key motifs on the front and shoulders; auspicious symbols rising above a geometric hem-border; and the naturalistic depiction of motifs.

China and the World
Sculpting Couture from Tradition
Guo Pei's magnificent artworks and historical Chinese export art share similarities in method of decoration, and also often feature hybrid designs. In particular, blue-and-white porcelain that were customised for different markets, was so popular that it developed into a visual symbol for all Chinese trade objects. For example, large dishes like this with rims of swirling, crested waves and intertwined flowers were exported to the Middle East for elite Islamic clients in the 15th century.
Blue-and-white porcelain has also deeply resonated with fashion designers in China and beyond.
One of Guo Pei's most renowned sculptural masterpieces, this blue-and-white gown was inspired by Chinese blue-and-white porcelain, in both design and technique. Like porcelain, the designs were hand-drawn and hand-painted. Skilfully draped to fan out, the fabric achieves a ceramic shard-like effect.
Similar to the museum dish in decoration, this gown depicts large single blooms of the lotus, surrounded by five borders of decoration that include crests, cloud and thunder (yunwen and leiwen) patterns (known as â€œkey-fretâ€ in the West), waves, lingzhi fungus, and flowers, 10,780 Swarovski crystals embellishments give a sparkling, finishing touch.

Treasured Heirlooms: Chinese Bridal Dress
Empress for a Day
This bridal ensemble of a robe and vest, possibly worn by a Peranakan bride in Penang, inspired Guo Pei to make a golden version in response. This one is noteworthy for the unusual outer vest featuring a lively pair of five-clawed dragons. The vest (xiapei éœžå¸”) was culturally significant in the Ming and Qing periods for its reference to an elevated status of the bride as â€œempress of the dayâ€ on her wedding day.
â€œTraditionalâ€ bridal ensembles could also be creative in their time: A more common decoration for the vest was a mandarin badge, but designs made for the Chinese overseas often varied. Five-clawed dragons were restricted to the emperor and those close to him by sumptuary laws, but these rules were not tightly enforced during the late Qing period, especially not among the Chinese outside of China.
A cloud collar (yunjian), consisting of layers of segments resembling lingzhi fungus, lotus flower petals, and ornamental sceptres, was a striking feature of Chinese bridal ensembles worn by Peranakans.
This remarkable version features five layers of dense decoration that includes flowers, Buddhist symbols, and figures. Peranakans sometimes refer to these as a â€œphoenix collarâ€, drawing parallels with the neck feathers of the mythical bird. Cloud collars were also thought to be symbolic, separating the realm of the material, the body, from the spiritual, the head.
Guo Pei's golden creation shows influences from two bridal ensembles in the museum's Peranakan collection: a cloud collar and a vest. She expanded the traditional vest (xiapei éœžå¸”) into an elaborate jacket, open at the front, revealing a pair of large, multicoloured courting phoenixes on the inner robe. A cloud collar, and loose banded sleeves â€“ including the swastika, a Buddhist symbol for good fortune â€“ was incorporated to complete the look. In general, Guo Pei's elegant bridal dresses show an appreciation of Chinese forms, techniques, and imagery.

Fantastic Beasts and Auspicious Flowers
Singapore reminds Guo Pei of the mythical phoenix, with multicoloured feathers representing the different cultures of the country. The phoenix and peony were popular designs on porcelain made in China for the Peranakan Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia (called nyonyaware). Together, they complementarily connote royalty, wealth, rank, and honour.
Among the largest of nyonyaware, this kamcheng (covered jar) was used to serve festive food at celebrations.
Guo Pei's theatrical designs often blend Chinese imagery with Western silhouettes and three-dimensional tailoring. This billowy gown features elaborately embroidered phoenix tails, large peony blossoms, and grand waves dramatically swirling at the base of the cape.
Significantly, this dramatic creation represents Guo Pei's pursuit of the revival of traditional craft. Touched by silk peony accessories that she salvaged from the countryside, she directed her studio to craft and paint similar ones to adorn the billowy, full bodice of this dress.

Peranakan Connections
It is estimated that 75 per cent of overseas Chinese reside in Southeast Asia. Many selectively continued Chinese traditions as they adopted and adapted local traditions to develop their own distinct preferences.
This bridal ensemble (bottom right), possibly exported from China, is of the type favoured by the Peranakan Chinese in Penang. A jacket with side opening paired with two pleated skirts was also popular in China in the early 20th century. The ensemble is decorated with auspicious Chinese symbols, primarily the lotus, signifying purity and peace, and goldfishes, referring to abundance.
Rabbit fur trimmings, symbolising the wish for the couple to be fertile, decorate the scalloped edges. The striking bright orange is affectionately called â€œPinang orangeâ€ by Peranakan Chinese in Penang, referencing the colour of areca nut (pinang) used in betel chewing. Enjoying betel was a popular form of socialising and hospitality for the Peranakan Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia up till the 1940s.
While visiting the Peranakan Museum's traveling exhibition on Peranakan Chinese art in Paris in 2010, Guo Pei was so captivated by ACM's bridal jacket and skirt that she resolved to reinterpret it for a contemporary Chinese bride. Her version changes the tailoring, with a tighter silhouette and tapered sleeves, and combines the two skirts into one.
The central skirt panel is enlarged to feature more luxurious embroidery, and there are no skirt pleats or fur trimmings. Yet a strong resemblance remains in the colour palette of orange and green, use of elaborate gold embroidery, and respect for the core motifs of lotus and goldfishes and their auspicious meanings.
Celebrity actress Angelababy (Yang Yin) wore this elegant creation during her marriage ceremony to Huang Xiaoming, an event described as the â€œChinese wedding of the Yearâ€ in 2015. Guo Pei felt the dress suited her warm personality. The direction of cultural influence is seldom linear â€“ in this example, an early 20th-century Chinese bridal style exported to the overseas Chinese is given new life back in China by that country's leading couturier of today.

What is Ramadan?
The Muslim month of fasting and devotion
Ramadan is the ninth month on the Islamic calendar and the holiest month of the year. Muslims all around the world fast (referred to as puasa in Malay) from sunrise to sunset every day throughout the month. It is also believed that the first chapters of the Quran, the Islamic holy text, were revealed to Prophet Muhammad during this month.

A Lot More than Fasting
Why fast?
To our Muslim brothers and sisters, fasting is much more than abstaining from food and drinks. It's a deeply spiritual practice for them to strengthen their self control and inculcate greater compassion for others. It is believed that one could only truly empathise with the poor and needy by experiencing hunger and thirst themselves. This is also a special time for Muslims to meditate, self- reflect, and focus on spiritual growth.
Who fasts?
All Muslims are required to fast during this month. There are, of course, exceptions to this. Children who haven't reached the age of puberty, expectant mothers, and mothers who are breastfeeding are not required to fast. The elderly and the sick are also exempted. Women are exempted from fasting during their periods, and they can make up for these days another time.
Breakfast and break fast - Sahur and Iftar
During Ramadan, Muslims have their breakfasts before sunrise (sahur) and break fast after sunset (iftar). Every evening of the month, mosques around Singapore distribute bubur lambuk (rice porridge), while the streets of Geylang Serai and Jalan Bussorah (behind Masjid Sultan) light up with little stalls selling a wide variety of Malay culinary delights, gifts, and clothes.

Extra prayers, extra love
In addition to their daily prayers, Muslims are encouraged to take part in an extra session of night prayers known as Terawih. In Singapore, Muslims can take part in the Terawih prayer at home or join the congregation at the mosques, communal halls, or void decks of their HDB flats.

Giving to the less fortunate is an important part of Ramadan. All Muslims are also required to offer zakat fitrah, a donation to the poor and needy in their community. During the 2020 Coronavirus crisis, the local Muslim community has come together to express their gratitude to healthcare workers, and extend a helping hand to needy households, by donating 15,000 meals to them this month.

Hari Raya Puasa - the big celebration
When the fasting month ends
To mark the end of the fasting month, Muslims come together to celebrate Hari Raya Puasa, also known as Hari Raya Aidilfitri. As families gather, the younger generation would take turns to kiss the hand of their elders as a sign of respect, while asking them for forgiveness. This is also the day Muslims put on new clothes and decorate their homes with colourful lights. Here in Singapore, we have our own unique way of welcoming this special occasion.
Not missing out on flavours
Most locals and tourists would have tried the famous beef rendang (spicy beef stew), ketupat (rice cakes wrapped in coconut leaves), and lontong (coconut gravy rice cakes). While these are the main highlights of every Hari Raya feast, the celebration isn't complete without the delicious kuih (sweets) and biscuits. Kuih tart (pineapple tarts) and kuih bangkit (tapioca cookies) are must-haves for most families. Local bakeries are also giving popular snacks a different twist by infusing flavours such as durian, white chocolate, and even parmesan cheese.
Green packets and colour-coded outfits
During Hari Raya Aidilfitri, it is common for adults to give the young gifts and sweets. In Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries, we've given this tradition our own local flavour.
Here, working adults often distribute duit raya (gifts of money) in green packets to children as a gesture of goodwill, and at times to the elderly as a form of respect.
It is also common to see families wearing similar-coloured baju kurung, their traditional outfit, as a display of togetherness when they visit their relatives.

Debunking the myths
Ramadan and the religious act of fasting sometimes comes with its own set of misunderstandings. What are some of these misconceptions you had, or heard? Let us shed light on some of the more common ones.
Myth: Every Muslim has to fast during Ramadan
Fact: Only able-bodied adults have to fast. Children who haven't reached the age of puberty, the elderly, those who are sick, expectant mothers, mothers nursing their children, as well as women on their periods, are exempted.
Myth: Muslims do not eat and drink for a straight 30 days during Ramadan
Fact: Muslims only fast between sunrise and sunset. They have a meal before dawn and break their fast in the evenings.
Take a look below for more debunked myths!
  Let's Ramadan Together
Due to circuit breaker measures, this past Ramadan was unlike any other â€“ but that didn't make it any less special. From all across Singapore, Muslims and non-Muslims joined us as we celebrated #RamadanTogether through a series of LIVE events, filled with laughter, food and lots of cheer.
Watch: Ramadan Together Highlight Reel
  Iftar Together
Enjoying iftar â€“ or breaking fast â€“ together has always been a highlight for many Muslims in Singapore during Ramadan. While we may not have been able to share a meal together this year, that didn't stop us all from sharing a good time!
Iftar Together brought over 1000 Singaporeans together as we exchanged Ramadan stories, tips and interesting fun facts. We even capped things off with our first-ever virtual iftar session, and of course â€“ we had to take a giant group photo to remember this very special iftar.
Check out how Iftar Together went down in the video below!
Masak Together
There's nothing like some delicious traditional bites to get us in the festive mood. To help make this Ramadan even more special, Chef Sarah Ariffin dished out some of her favourite Ramadan and Hari Raya recipes for everyone to enjoy at our LIVE cooking show â€˜Masak Together'.
While Chef Sarah is well-known for her delicious creations, the stars of the show were definitely her irresistible Roti Jala with Chicken Curry, and her one-of-a-kind Cornflakes Meringue Cookies.

Concert Together
Hari Raya Puasa, also known as Hari Raya Aidilfitri, is a joyous occasion where Muslims come together to mark the end of Ramadan. The festivities usually involve lots of food, laughter and not to forget â€“ music.
To wrap up our series of Ramadan events, we hosted a Hari Raya celebration unlike any other with â€˜Concert Together', a LIVE performance by some of Singapore's favourite artistes like Sezairi, Aisyah Aziz and Jatt Ali.
We were treated to soulful renditions of Hari Raya classics and some of their original hits, as we enjoyed an evening of stories, games, and well-wishes together from our homes.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/conversion-circumcision-and-an-angry-mum/conversion-circumcision-and-an-angry-mum-the-journey-of-one-couples-interracial-marriage,"TL;DR
To marry Rita Ahmad (right), the love of his life, Llewelyn Ridhwan Teng (left) got circumcised and converted to Islam. This journey was fraught with challenges. Among other things, he had to endure the wrath of his mother.
This is an abridged version of a RICE Media article which was written in partnership with the National Heritage Board. It was originally published in August 2020 as a companion piece to NSFTV's short, fictional film on the challenges faced by interracial couples in pre-independence Singapore.
For Your 55th is a story of kind deeds, love, and loss. Watch this tale of a rickshaw puller and a young nurse as they navigate romance in 1929, across ethnicity, class, and time. This video was made in collaboration with Not Safe For TV.
  Rita Ahmad, 47, was queuing for food at an eatery in Pasir Ris when a Chinese boy in his 20s approached her and asked shyly: â€œIs the Chinese man sitting there your husband?â€
Befuddled, Rita, who was dining with her spouse Llewelyn Ridhwan Teng, 52, nodded.
â€œCan I ask how his parents accepted you?â€ he continued.
Rita ventured: â€œYour girlfriend Malay ah?â€
â€œYes, and my parents cannot accept it,â€ the boy answered. F
or the briefest moment, Rita was transported back to the 1990s. She saw a younger version of her husband, perplexed and troubled by the challenges brought about by their interracial coupling.
Not much has changed in Singapore since she started dating Llewelyn, then a Roman Catholic, in 1994, she thought.
The pair had met two years before, having been posted to the same work team at SATS, a catering service provider at Changi Airport. Due to their religious differences, they did not entertain the idea of getting together.
Chuckling, Llewelyn said: â€œ(But) when you work hand in hand with your team 10 to 12 hours a day, you don't really have a social life outside the airport so you can't help but get close to the people you work with.â€
  Their love story began with Rita receiving notes from a secret admirer. One, dated 22 January 1994, read: â€œDearest Rita, I miss you so much that my heart aches! Secret Admirerâ€.
Another came attached to a drink. It said: â€œTo my dearest Rita, enjoy the drink and food of â€˜lâ¤ï¸ve'! Wz lots and lots of love, guess who?â€,
â€œI was so naÃ¯ve,â€ Rita giggled. â€œI told Llewelyn someone was into me. He said he'd help me check who the person was. He was such a good actor.â€
Apprehension, Conflict and Tension
Their relationship hit a major bump in the road when Llewelyn's mum found out that he was courting a Malay Muslim. â€œShe was furious. There was a lot of disapproval, anger and tension at home,â€ he said. â€œShe knew that if I got married to Rita, I would have to convert.â€
His mother went out of her way to express her unhappiness and attempted to drive a wedge between the couple. Whenever they called each other, she would pick up the other phone in the house and place its receiver at the radio. Rita was unable to hear him clearly so he had to use a public phone.
On the few occasions Rita visited Llewelyn at home, his mother acted oblivious to her presence.
Llewelyn's mum also mobilised his family against him. He said: â€œI believe that my younger brother and sister may have been more accepting of Rita. But they could see how unhappy I had made my mum so they backed herâ€¦ and tried to knock some sense into me,â€ said Llewelyn.
Despite the obstacles placed in their way, the couple said they bear no grudges. Rita said: â€œI think his mother was thinking ahead and wanting the best for her son. (She wanted to make) sure we were serious (about each other). As parents now, Llewelyn and I understand (where she was coming from).â€
Llewelyn's mother had a change of heart about two years into their dating life. In 1996, when Llewelyn's family moved to Tampines, one of the first things she did was to invite Rita over for a house tour.
Soon after, the couple married. By this time, Llewelyn had converted to Islam.
Such interracial and interreligious unions were uncommon in the 1990s. The statistics say it all.
In 1994, only 8.8% of all marriages in Singapore were between individuals of different races. In 1984, the figure stood at just 6.3%.
What gives? By and large, who we end up with still tends to be greatly influenced by social norms and traditions within our own ethnic and cultural spheres.
Sociologists Riaz Hasan and Geoffrey Benjamin expand on this theory in their journal article Ethnic Outmarriage Rates in Singapore: The Influence of Traditional Socio-Cultural Organization. They argue that marriage for a Chinese man tends to be â€œcircumscribed by family controlâ€ due to the patrilineal culture. This is why they tend to marry within their race compared with their female counterparts who are five times more likely to marry outside of it.
Meanwhile, Indians â€œexpend much effort in ensuring that their daughters marry properlyâ€ because â€œin Hindu-Indian beliefâ€¦ it is maternityâ€¦ that determines a person's ritual (and hence social) standing.â€1
The authors of the paper note however that: â€œIslamic allegiance in itself has an overriding and equalising effectâ€ which explains the higher incidence of interracial marriages between Indian Muslims and Malay Muslims.
Acceptance, Compromise and Love
Rita's relationship with Llewelyn's mother continued to blossom.
Dabbing her eyes with tissue as she teared, Rita recounted how her mother-in-law made an effort to tell her she looked beautiful on the day of her Malay wedding. The make-up artist was not the best, Rita shared. â€œMy mother-in-law knocked on my door and told me, â€˜Whatever it is, you still look pretty'.â€
She would go on to be incredibly supportive of the couple, helping them to house hunt for instance. Every Chinese New Year, the family also prepares separate dishes to accommodate their family unit. Eventually, Llewelyn's mother stopped cooking pork at home, choosing only to consume the meat as a dine-out option.
Rita gushed that her mother-in-law is her best friend now.
What caused Llewelyn's mum to change her attitude towards their interracial relationship?
Llewelyn said he was simply focused on being with Rita. â€œI didn't really try to convince my family much. Rita was just another human being, you know? Rita was just a woman whom I wanted to marry someday. After two years of courtship, my mum realised I was not going to let this girl go. So she accepted it.â€
Are interracial marriages more common today?
In 2018, such unions comprised 22.4% of all marriages in Singapore, a significant three-fold jump from Rita and Llewelyn's courtship days, and four times more than in 1965, when Singapore first gained independence.
Llewelyn said: â€œI suppose our society is now more tolerant of such marriagesâ€, adding that there are other mixed marriages on his side of his family.
Rita chimed in: â€œSociety is more open to mixed marriages now. One of my cousins followed in my footsteps and married a Chinese man.â€
Sociologists believe that marital assimilation signals the final breakdown of social barriers between groups. If so, the growing number of such unions certainly bodes well for Singapore's multicultural fabric.
â€œCan I ask how his parents accepted you?â€ the boy asked Rita as they stood in line for food in Pasir Ris.
They may not accept your relationship at first, Rita replied. â€œWhat you have to do is show them that you're serious about it, that you will take responsibility, that you love the person, and respect their religion.â€

While many Singaporeans will recognise its name, Thaipusam's roots, rituals and practitioners are still unfamiliar to many. This important festival is celebrated every year, primarily by Singapore's Tamil Hindu community, on the full-moon day of the Tamil month of Thai. For many believers, Thaipusam is a time of devotion, sacrifice and thanksgiving, dedicated to the Hindu god Murugan, who symbolises bravery, power and virtue.
The festival commemorates Lord Murugan's victory over evil forces with a vel, or spear, which is why spears are a significant part of the festival. One of the most recognisable elements of Thaipusam is the ceremonial procession of the kavadi-bearers â€“ men who walk carrying large metal structures known as kavadi, which are fixed with spikes or hooks that pierce their bodies. Believers bear the kavadi, which translates to â€œsacrifice at every stepâ€, in order to fulfil vows made to Lord Murugan, or as an expression of thanks to the deity.

The Legend of Murugan and Idumban
The practice of carrying kavadi originates in a legend from the Puranas, a collection of sacred, ancient Sanskrit texts. According to legend, Idumban was instructed by his master, Saint Agasthya, to go to the Mount Kailai range and fetch two hills belonging to Lord Murugan. Idumban took the two hills, tied them together, and carried them on his shoulders. But on his way back, Idumban became lost.
Lord Murugan then appeared to Idumban in the form of a king and led him to a place called Thiruvavinankudi (or Palani). There, he asked Idumban to rest before continuing on his journey.
Once rested, Idumban tried to lift his load again, but found that he could not. Then a child in a loincloth appeared on top of one of the hills and claimed ownership over them. Angered, Idumban attacked the child, but was defeated. Idumban then realised that the child was none other than Lord Murugan himself.
Idumban pleaded for Lord Murugan's forgiveness. He also begged the deity to grant him a blessing â€“ that whoever worships Lord Murugan carrying an object resembling two hills suspended from a pole would be given their heart's desire. Lord Murugan granted Idumban this wish and also added that those who carried sandalwood, milk and flowers in a kavadi to his shrine would also be blessed. To this day, those who wish to be blessed by Lord Murugan continue the practice of carrying kavadi.

Thaipusam in Singapore
While Thaipusam is celebrated by Hindus all over the world, the festival is particularly significant for the Tamil communities of Singapore and Malaysia. In Singapore, Thaipusam has been a major religious festival for over a hundred years, and preparations for the entire festival start months before the actual procession. Kavadi-bearers also take special care to condition their minds and bodies beforehand so that they may safely perform their rites of devotion, while other devotees prepare themselves spiritually with prayers, fasting, and acts of penance.

Tracing the Devotees Path
On Thaipusam, kavadi-bearers and their supporters walk the traditional route, which starts at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple on Serangoon Road, and ends at the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple on Tank Road. Barefoot, kavadi-bearers walk this path that is more than a hundred years old, while other worshippers carry offerings such as paalkudams or milk pots, fruit and flowers. Along the way, devotees may pause in front of the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, where they pray for the goddess Kaliamman's blessings.

Journeys of Devotion
While kavadi-bearers might be the most recognisable figures of Thaipusam, it takes an entire community to make the festival possible. From piercers to friends and family, every individual journey of devotion is important, with each person making a significant contribution to the festival in their own way. Here are some of their stories.
Journeys of Devotion: The Kavadi-bearer
Kavadi-bearers often begin conditioning their minds and bodies weeks before Thaipusam, by fasting, or having simple vegetarian meals, observing celibacy, and abstaining from creature comforts such sleeping on beds. Preparations also include obtaining a kavadi from a traditional craftsmen, or even designing their own. Personal details are often added to each kavadi to express a believer's personal relationship with their god.
Watch: A Journey of Devotion: The Kavadi-bearer
  Each kavadi-bearer's journey is unique. Murali Raj, who has been carrying kavadi for over a decade, shares his experience: â€œ[I carried my] first kavadi 15 years ago â€“ it was the spike kavadi. It's not those small arch kavadis, it's the one where you carry the whole figure, which is supported using the belt.â€
â€œFor my first piercing, I was nervous, not knowing what the feeling would be like. It was just like an ant bite, but to have continuous piercings one after the other â€“ that's when you will just have to endure it. But what actually makes the difference is the traditional music that is being played, and your family and friends singing the religious songs. I think that's what diverts your mind and so you don't concentrate on the pain when you're getting pierced.â€
At the end of the walk, he adds, â€œYou can't express the happiness because you're so-called â€˜caged up'. But you dance towards the celebration, you dance with the kavadi as a form of enjoyment, fulfillment. It's a form of fulfilment that whatever that I vowed, it's been granted, and that's what makes me want to carry on. Whatever I can do for Murugan, I just do it for him â€“ in the name of devotion, and not anything else.â€

Journeys of Devotion: The Piercer
One of the most fascinating aspects of Thaipusam is that, often, no blood can be seen from the piercings that are made onto the kavadi-bearer's skin. This is attributed to the spiritual essence of the ritual, but is also largely due to the skill and know-how of the piercers themselves. All piercers participate on a voluntary basis and some, like Tamilchelvan Suppiah, are highly in demand for their decades of experience.
Watch: A Journey of Devotion - The Piercer

â€œI got involved from a young age,â€ recalls Tamilchelvan. â€œA person called P. Nanthakumar was the one who taught me how to pierce and most of the prayers â€“ he taught me what to do in the traditional and proper way.â€
â€œOne day, he was carrying the kavadi, and one of the piercers did not turn up because he was busy or somewhere else. Then he just called me, â€œCome, Chelvan, you just poke for me.â€ Then I was scared and unable to do it because I was afraid. Then he just encouraged me â€“ â€œI've already taught you how to do it, then why don't you do it?â€
Having volunteered as a piercer for over 40 years, Tamilchelvan is a mainstay of the Thaipusam community. â€œIt's changed me a lot in my life,â€ he says. â€œOn that day, I feel grateful to Lord Murugan and the devotees who give me a chance to do it. Surrounded by a lot of devotees, everybody is feeling at peace and calm in their own thoughts. I feel very happy... It feels like I'm in a spiritual world.â€

Journeys of Devotion: The Musician
Traditionally, live music forms a significant part of the Thaipusam procession. Hymns are often sung by friends and family, and religious songs known as bhajans are also sung by groups of musicians who follow kavadi-bearers â€“ to boost their spirits as they make their arduous journey.
Watch: A Journey of Devotion: The Musician
  â€œMy day typically starts early,â€ says Jathishweran Naidu, a Thavil player who has participated as a musician for several years.  â€œI come to the Perumal temple in the wee hours and the first and foremost important thing to do is to pay respect to the deities at the temple. Then we go and have a look around to see the different kinds of kavadis that are on display. People actually put in a lot of effort into doing up their kavadis, so it is quite a sight. Finally, we settle down for someone's kavadi and then we start the bhajans there and we follow him throughout his journey.â€
For Jathish, celebrating Thaipusam brings him back to his roots and contributes to an important sense of community: â€œFrom the time my dad started carrying the kavadi, I was always part of Thaipusam,â€ he recalls. â€œEvery year we look forward to this because it brings everyone together. Everything is interconnected â€“ to me, by helping the kavadi-bearers getting from one end to the other, we are doing what we can. It makes me feel good, especially when the kavadi-bearers come and say thank you at the end of the day. I'm quite thankful to be a part of it.â€
Journeys of Devotion: The Thaneer Panthal Volunteer
Along the route, volunteers at various thaneer panthal â€“ or water points â€“ pour water onto the feet of kavadi-bearers to relieve them from walking barefoot on the hot tarmac, and also offer food and water to the rest of the community.
Watch: A Journey of Devotion - The Thaneer Panthal Volunteer
â€œWe are not just giving people water, but making them feel looked after and giving refreshments to people who have spent the whole day helping others too,â€ says Mano Manikam, who has volunteered at the Vel Murugan Thaneer Panthal for over a decade.
Even for those not carrying kavadis, preparations for Thaipusam can be intense and time-consuming. â€œOn the eve, we're already there to prepare. We do our own prayers for the tentage, and we make an effort to decorate it with traditional banana trees, flowers and garlands,â€ explains Mano. â€œWe sleep overnight in the tent itself, because the activity has pretty much started â€“ the milk pot carriers are there just before midnight on the eve.â€
Like many, Mano finds the spiritual fulfillment and social bonds at Thaipusam to be worth every effort:  â€œWe are giving back to Lord Murugan by giving back to our community â€“ whether you're clearing rubbish or setting up safety structures, everyone is doing it as part of offering to God. I've been volunteering for close to 14 years now, so I've seen the kids of friends, who are now teenagers, also coming into it. So that, for me, is a very satisfying thing to see. To be part of it is something that I'd never want to miss.â€

Journeys of Devotion: Friends and Family
Friends and family also play an essential role in the Thaipusam procession. â€œWhen someone is carrying kavadi or milk pot, the moral support [from friends and family], the songs they sing, is absolutely important to the person doing the ritual,â€ explains Mano. Supporters walk alongside the kavadi-bearers shouting â€œVel! Vel!â€ and singing hymns or Bhajans to motivate the kavadi-bearers and give them encouragement to complete their walk. â€œAs long as you are wholly involved in this festival,â€ adds Mano, â€œyou're playing a role that is absolutely critical.â€

Participating in Thaipusam
Excited to learn more about Thaipusam? Why not experience it for yourself! Thaipusam is an important expression of our multicultural nation, and all Singaporeans â€“ regardless of their belief â€“ can observe and even participate in the festival.
In 2020, Thaipusam falls on Saturday, 8 February. Recommended locations for observing the procession are along Serangoon Road, all the way to Tank Road. As a sign of respect, avoid entering the temples where devotees fulfill their vows. Come attired in clothes that cover your shoulders and knees. Generally, clothing also should be loose and not revealing, as befits a religious festival. Observers are welcome to take photographs, but should do so discreetly and respectfully, without blocking devotees' paths. For more helpful information, visit https://thaipusam.sg/.

Conservation Services
One of the key duties of the HCC is to care for and carry out conservation treatment on the National Collection (NC). The main purpose of this is to strengthen the stability of its physical condition so that the artefacts and artworks can remain accessible for generations to come and preserve our shared heritage. The artefacts are diverse, and their physical condition can range from stable to fragile.
In the HCC, Conservation Services comprises 4 specialisms, namely Objects Conservation, Paintings Conservation, Paper Conservation and Textiles Conservation.  
The Conservator assesses and documents the condition of the artefacts through various means of examination techniques and then, provides conservation treatment or preservation recommendations for storage and display. A Conservation Scientist from the Conservation Science section undertakes instrumental analysis in characterising the material composition of an artefact to help the Conservator make informed conservation treatment decisions.

Unveiling the Uncharted â€“ Objects & Paper Conservation
by Lee Siew Wah & Sylvia Haliman
Conservation treatment is an important part of collections care. Treatment methods range from cleaning to repair.
Before doing so, however, conservators first try to find out more about the artefact: what it is made of; how it was made; what kind of damage or deterioration it has suffered, and why. Some of this information can be gained by examining the artefact under magnification, or with the help of imaging techniques using specialised equipment. Understanding the artefact helps us to make suitable treatment decisions to improve its stability or appearance, without altering its historical and socio-cultural significance.
Manuscript Map on Vellum
This map, which is attributed to the Dutch burgher Abraham de Wind, was drawn on vellum (calfskin parchment). Although it may have been stored and handled improperly at some point in its history, the map was still largely intact when received by HCC. However, ink inscriptions on the map appeared faded from physical abrasion. 
In multispectral imaging, the artefacts are exposed to different light sources. Conservators can obtain more information about the artefacts from observing the different behaviours of materials under different wavelengths of light. The information obtained can help us to identify the materials and devise conservation treatments for the artefacts. 
Through the use of multispectral imaging, we were able to determine that the map's inscriptions were written using iron gall ink.

As iron gall ink degrades, it produces chemicals that readily absorb ultraviolet radiation. Hence, iron gall ink appears darker under ultraviolet light, which makes the ink inscriptions more obvious.
Interestingly, iron gall ink is invisible under infra-red radiation; this unique property is one of the confirmative tests for iron gall ink. When we tested the map under infra-red radiation at 1000nm, its inscriptions were invisible.

Terrestrial and Celestial Globes
This pair of standing 21-inch English globes was made by John and William Cary â€“ well-known map-publishers and globe-makers of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Representing the largest size of globes produced during the 1800s, the pair consists of a terrestrial globe and a celestial globe. The terrestrial globe shows the tracks and discoveries made by Captain James Cook as well as that of Captain George Vancouver. The celestial globe features star coordinates and constellations.
This is the only pair of globes in the NC, kept as part of the collection of maps and charts.
The conservation of the globes was a collaborative effort between an objects conservator and a paper conservator â€“ in preparation for the globes' display in An Old New World at the National Museum of Singapore.

Examination of the structure and surface features of the globes
Conservators engaged in a range of examination processes to understand and to study the condition, material, damage, and construction found on the globes.
It was important to build up knowledge about the globes in order to devise a conservation treatment plan for the care of the globes.
    Microscopy
When the surface features of the globes were examined using a digital microscope, the following details were observed:
  The original print â€˜U' and in-painting of â€œLâ€ (left); Repair with new paper and in-painting of lines (right)
Marks created from burnishing the paper surface (left); Paper in-fill (right)
  Plaster layer can be seen through the holes on paper support (left); Metal particle from the paper making process (right)
UV-induced visible fluorescence examination
The UV examination revealed the different varnishes on the globe and its stand and led to the discovery of many old repaired areas.

Conservators and curators worked closely to discuss the treatment needs of the globes.
Curators were concerned about the legibility of the globes' inscriptions, which are obscured by the glossy and discoloured varnish. However, it was risky for conservators to remove the varnish due to its complexity â€“ possibly involving multiple layers of original and new or added varnish.
After discussion with the curators, a decision was made to leave the varnish intact and untreated.
X-ray
X-ray imaging unveiled the globes' interior â€“ revealing essential information about construction methods, points of weaknesses, as well as old repairs.
As X-ray is non-invasive, this method allowed conservators to examine the globes' interior without disrupting their surface or structure.

CT Scan
By allowing us to separate and select individual layers and parts of the globe shell, the CT scan provided a defined form of the hollow interior. We were able to confirm the thinness of the shell, as well as the presence of a metal weight â€“ used as a counterbalance â€“ within both globes.
  CT scan image of celestial globe
Construction of the globes
From this investigation, we found that each globe is comprised of two wooden hemispheres joined at the equator to form a hollow sphere with a metal weight within it to act as a counterbalance for the globe. Internally, the sphere is supported by a wooden centre pillar which holds the hour ring, pivot clamp, nails, and meridian ring in place. The meridian ring has grooves, enabling the globes to be rotated on two axes.
Covering the wooden spheres is a plaster layer that is overlaid with printed paper. During the globes' construction, the paper support was burnished, sized, hand-coloured with water colours, and, finally, coated with varnish.
Making it Last â€“ Textiles Conservation
by Geraldine Sim
After examining and investigating an artefact, the conservator may carry out treatment. Conservation treatment encompasses a variety of activities, such as cleaning and repair, and can involve the use of various tools and materials that are uniquely suited to the required task. What the conservator decides to do depends on the needs of the artefact, with the aim of preserving and highlighting its significance. If needed, a specially designed mount may be created for the artefact so that it can be safely and appropriately displayed.
Child's Baju Panjang
Child's Baju Panjang
This child's baju panjang, or long shirt, was tailored in Indonesia during the second half of the 18th century, using imported cotton from the Coromandel Coast in India. Its striped and floral pattern â€“ in red, blue, purple, and white â€“ was created from hand painted, mordanting, and resist dyeing of the cotton fabric. 
  Dutch trade routes during the 18th century, when the fabric for the baju panjang would have been traded between the Coromandel Coast and South Sumatra
The baju panjang was the standard women's wear for most local communities in the Dutch East Indies. However, this garment's small size suggests that it was worn by a child, and is particularly rare. As it is long and loose fitting, this jacket provided ventilation in the hot and humid climate of this region and would have been worn over a batik sarong.
When HCC received the baju panjang, we documented conditions such as holes, tears, staining, and previous repairs â€“ using a microscope for detailed documentation.

Beyond Aesthetics â€“ Paintings Conservation
by Filzah Mohd Amir
A variety of media and techniques can be found in the paintings of the National Collection. They range from traditional easel paintings and paintings on glass and wooden panels, to three-dimensional modern and contemporary artworks. They present the diversity of cultural heritage across Singapore and Southeast Asia. Conservators, as custodians of these works of art, have a duty to ensure their long-term preservation. To properly care for these paintings, we strive to understand their structural and material properties, cultural significance, and artists' intent.
You can learn about selected tasks that Paintings Conservators do, as well as types of damages to paintings as you scroll along the images below.

Framing the Moment
by Damian Lizun
Picture frames are vulnerable to damage. It may occur during exhibition, storage, and transportation, and can be caused by poor handling, adverse environmental factors, neglect, and irreversible restoration. Historic frames are also more complex than they first appear to be and can be made up of a wide variety of materials. Therefore, frame and particularly gilding conservation is a discipline that integrates traditional skills and techniques with modern materials and approaches. The purpose of this case study is to highlight a few details about the frame's design and the techniques involved in its fabrication and conservation.
Carlo Maratta Frame
The role of the frame in the presentation of a picture fulfils two main functions: protecting and enhancing the painting. Notwithstanding its usual subordinate role, the frame is also a work of art in its own right, designed by an artist or architect and executed by a highly skilled wood carver and gilder. The frame for the portrait of Sir Robert Fullerton is an example of classical elegance that discreetly emphasises the dignity of the portraited subject without overpowering it. 
Here, we highlight a few details about the frame's design and the techniques involved in its fabrication. By bringing into the foreground the tradition of craftsmanship and virtuosity behind frame-making and frame conservation treatments, we hope to help the public understand that a picture frame is a complex piece of artwork and that its welfare depends on proper preservation and, where necessary, conservation treatment.
  Portrait of Robert Fullerton
Provenance and style
The frame appears to be the original for the portrait of Sir Robert Fullerton attributed to George Chinnery (1774â€“1852), painted between 1802-1807. The frame is a superb example of the British framing style known as Carlo Maratta, which was widely used in England between 1750 and 1820. The style has a characteristic profile that features a concave hollow, known as scotia, in the centre of the frame, which rises outwards to meet a convex top edge. This classical form was decorated with independently carved and gilded ornaments: acanthus-and-tongue in scotia; ribbon-and-stick along the lustre top edge; and leaf-and-tongue along the back edge. The lack of complicated centre and corner ornaments made Carlo Maratta frames economical to construct and, hence, popular among frame-makers of that time.
  Decorative bands in detail
How was the frame joined?
The individual frame sections were each made using a single piece of oak wood. The sections are assembled with complicated mortise-and-tenon joints with mitre half-lap corner joints. These types of joints provide utmost strength and stability to the frame, and no keys, dowels, or nails are required.

Conservation issues
The frame was in a poor state of preservation before exhibition. The surface of the front of the frame was completely covered with dust and grime, which significantly disfigured the gilded finish. Some parts of the gilded finish were severely and unevenly worn, exposing the coloured bole or white gesso. Other parts were liberally overpainted with a bronze paint during the past restoration. All nails securing the ornamental decoration were corroded and had become weak, resulting in partial detachment of the ornaments from the frame. Intensive nailing of the decoration bands to the frame resulted in the cracking and separation of the gesso layer from the wood.
Conservation treatment
The discipline of frame conservation integrates traditional skills and techniques with modern materials and approaches. The conservation was divided into four major treatments: consolidation of weak and unstable gesso; cleaning of gilded finish; infilling the lost gesso; and gilding in the areas of lost or heavily and unevenly worn gold leaf. The consolidation and cleaning of the frame took advantage of modern materials and methods.
On the other hand, the infilling and gilding involved the use of traditional recipes and techniques, which guarantee the perfect integration of the new and old materials.

The Technique of Gilding
Gilding â€“ the process of applying extremely thin sheets of gold to a surface â€“ requires gilders to have extensive skills, knowledge, tools and experience in order to obtain good results.

The Miracles of Science â€“ Conservation Science
by Lynn Chua
Science plays an important role in the field of Art and Heritage Conservation. Through this interdisciplinary field â€“ â€œConservation Scienceâ€ â€“ we study the material and chemical aspects of the artwork using scientific instrumentation.
The analyses of artworks can be non-invasive (do not require taking a sample) or micro-invasive (a small sample is taken from the artwork). Such analyses can help us to understand how artefacts were made, or how they have degraded, so that we can care for them appropriately.
Officer's Sword
Lloyd's Patriotic Fund Â£50 presentation sword
This sword, dated 1804, was presented to the captain of an East India Company ship as a reward. While we marvelled at its beauty, we wondered how the sword had been decorated, prompting us to study the gilded and blue areas using scientific analysis.
How was the gold applied? 
Through X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, we found traces of mercury (Hg) in the gold (Au). This result suggests that the gold was applied through mercury gilding. 
  XRF analysis of the gold gilding on the sword
  Bluing technique
Through Raman spectroscopy analysis, the blue areas of the sword were found to contain magnetite, an iron oxide that is black with a metallic luster.

The Blacksmith's Craftsmanship
Magnetite can be formed on steel by heat or chemical treatment. Further examination with a light microscope suggests that the bluing technique was likely achieved chemically through â€œrust bluingâ€: 
This process involved rusting the steel surface evenly by coating it with an acid solution. The sword was then immersed in boiling water to convert the red rust to black magnetite.
As the final blue hue depended on the thickness and uniformity of the magnetite film, blacksmiths required skill and technique to achieve the desired shade of blue. 
Aside from improving its aesthetics, bluing also had the additional benefit of protecting the steel from corrosion.

  The East India Company Chart Case
East India Company Chart Case
During the early 19th century, this leather chart case was used for storing sea charts. At first glance, the surface was observed to be highly glossy with crack lines. This was an unexpected occurrence, not normally seen in degrading leather. 
To help the conservator decide how to preserve the chart case, scientific investigation was carried out. Crack lines on the chart case allowed us to extract tiny fragments for analysis. Thanks to advances in modern-day instrumentation, we were able to address the conservator's questions relating to the chart case's conservation.

Was a coating applied on the leather?
Under ultraviolet (UV) light, a yellowish fluorescence suggested the presence of a coating.
  Examining the chart case under UV light
Under blue light, an area of loss on the chart case revealed three layers: 
An outer yellow fluorescing layer
A black layer
An innermost reddish fluorescing layer likely to be leather

Thus, we could conclude that the leather case was covered with a coating.
What type of coating?
A tiny loose fragment lifting from the surface of the chart case was embedded in resin, ground and polished to reveal its cross-section.
When stained with chemical solutions, all layers (1-3) darkened, indicating that the layers contain:
Oil
Protein

  What type of coating?
Through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) imaging, the chemical component in each layer was identified as: 
Lacquer
Leather
Leather
Hence, we concluded that the surface coating is an oil-based lacquer, likely added by the maker to offer sheen, durability, and weatherproofing properties to the leather case. These findings clarified our understanding of the degraded surface, enabling the conservator to decide whether to treat, retain, or remove the coating on the chart case.

Find out what goes on in the Conservation Science Laboratory at the Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC) in an exclusive interview with Singapore's only conservation scientists, Lynn (L) and Xu Mei (XM). Get a behind-the-scenes rundown of how artworks and artefacts are investigated and subsequently restored, and even learn about the perks of being in this niche yet collaborative field of work.
What is Conservation Science?
Everyone knows that artworks and artefacts need plenty of care, and at times restoration, especially for the ancient and historical pieces. It is easy to label conservators and curators as being at the forefront of this restorative projects.
Conservation Science, on the other hand, looks to investigate the material aspects of these artworks and artefacts. Using advanced analytical technology, conservation scientists investigate the provenance, materials and techniques, as well as determine the original appearance of these works under careful treatment. Their investigations come in tandem with others from the curatorial and conservation departments of the HCC.
Q&A
How did we enter the field of Conservation Science?
L:
In 2009, I started out as an assistant conservator of paintings. Subsequently, I developed an interest in paint cross-sections and the identification of artist' materials. That led me to an internship at the V&A Conservation Science lab, which broadened my understanding of the benefits conservation science has in the preservation of artworks.
Back then, the HCC did not have a dedicated science department, and that's when we, a team of conservators and senior managers, embarked on a journey to set up the Conservation Science lab. In 2014, I continued to pursue my interest in the field with a Masters' research programme specializing in micro-analysis of painted artworks using different instrumentation. That led to an opportunity to understudy a senior conservation scientist at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Returning to the HCC in 2016, I assist in the equipment and development of the Conservation Science lab.
XM:
Conservation Science was a mid-career switch for me. When I left my first job, last year, doing toxic chemical analysis, I chanced upon a job posting online for the role. I had never heard of Conservation Science, or the idea of Conservation, before joining the HCC! I was on the lookout for a stimulating career that could broaden my perspectives, and Conservation Science has proven to be a perfect fit. My initial impression of the role was the simple material analysis of artwork, but I soon came to realise that the possibility of questions arising from working with these artworks and artefacts are endless.
Here's what a typical day at work is like.
XM:
We answer questions. Plenty of them. As artefact analysis is at the core of what we do, typical questions we usually get from conservators and curators are â€˜What is this object made of?' or â€˜What is this abnormality that we see or smell?'.
To break it down, conservators ask questions about artefacts in order to inform on conservation treatment decisions, such as choice of solvents to use, while curators' questions are meant to supplement knowledge of the artefacts, such as place and period of an object's origin, which can be shared in display panels or brochures.
How do we find the answers to these questions? Usually, we need to get samples from the objects, and analyse them on the lab's instruments. Sometimes, the samples can be so tiny, that they can't be seen with the naked eye. The entire process of extracting the samples, preparing them for analysis, running the analysis on instruments (yes, multiple instruments!), then interpreting the results can take days to weeks, depending on the complexity of the question and object.
What makes it even more challenging is that these samples are very limited, sometimes only giving us one shot at an analysis. The work we do is never routine, as we may be looking at textiles one day, and ceramics the next.
Besides the direct analysis of objects, Conservation Science is also concerned with detecting chemical gases in the environment that surround artefacts on display or in storage. Some gases do cause artefacts to degrade, and have to be removed or reduced if detected. Hence, materials such as showcase boards, mannequin fabrics and even the paint on the walls are tested for off-gassing before use.
L:
Xu Mei pretty much summed it up. Just to add on, our work does not keep us in the lab all of the time. To help confirm our analytical results, you may find us outside the HCC looking for reference materials like poison tree sap, chicken blood, peach gum, and more. In fact, we look to explore new techniques on the market that can be applied to artworks or visiting museums and stores for in-situ analysis, meaning we get to learn new things almost every day.
So, what have we been up to lately?
L:
Often, having a conversation with like-minded colleagues do lead to collaborations and interesting surprises. Recently, a case on fading pink dye was raised in one such exchange, involving various fabrics in our Peranakan textile collection. It was observed that even in minimal light exposure, such as within the museum, the pink fabrics would still show noticeable fading after a few months. That got us curious about the dye used in this collection, since they all showed the same fading trend. Through non-invasive examinations, we narrowed the possibility to an early synthetic dye called eosin (the result has not been concluded at the time of this interview). This same dye can also be found in Van Gogh's paintings, and is well-known to fade extremely quickly.
XM:
As for me, the most interesting question would be in reference to a hair queue (style of pulling back hair into a braided tail, worn by Manchu Chinese men) worn by a male subject during the Qing dynasty. Was the hair from a human or an animal? At first, I felt like the answer to the curator's question seemed out of reach. Upon further research, the origin of this hair was deduced simply by observing the fine structures of a single strand of hair under a high magnification microscope â€“ an established forensic technique. Interestingly, we compared the sample to hairs from different animals and even some from our generous colleagues, and thus, it was concluded that the hair queue was of human origin.
There are times when we get stuck. But there's always a solution to a problem. Here's how we deal with it:
L:
Since the variety of materials in our National Collection is so huge, there are times when I can't answer the questions posed to me. As a conservation scientist, I am not exactly an expert in all materials and techniques. That's when I may need to consult a conservator, someone who has years of practical experience dealing with a certain type of object, or a curator who knows the history of the object best. Sometimes, we even look to a conservation scientist in another country, who may have worked on a similar problem.
Although well-equipped, there are times when we approach our vendors and local universities for technical help. Personally, I have encountered analysis cases that remain unsolved for years, but with technique and technological improvements on the market, have managed to recently revisit them. If in doubt, just keep on trying.
XM:
Agreed! Among the most difficult questions I've encountered are those relating to how degradation products are formed on objects over the course of time, which can go back to hundreds of years. Understanding the degradation process will help to prevent similar occurrences in the future, which helps current day artists make better informed choices of the materials to use. In addition, the objects studied may have been exposed to complex environments, such as undersea or caves. All these complicate the degradation process and make it hard to pinpoint the contributing factors or replicate the process for study.
Do we actually understand the art we are analysing?
XM:
To a certain extent, yes. Coming from a purely science background, having zero knowledge of art history proved to be a setback, as the lack of understanding I had for the artwork did affect my analysis. It is important to understand the materials and techniques available during the time period or the preferred choice of materials and style used by the artist, as that would help narrow down the list of possible suspects greatly.
Gaining information on where the object has been located and how it was used will also provide much insight for analysis. This requires in-depth research on the history of the specific object, which can comprise on-site overseas studies and interviews with artists (or their relatives) and art sellers.
Are there any unique challenges in our work?
XM:
Yes, analysis of samples are delicate issues, as artworks are precious and one-of-a-kind. When we draw a sample, we take only micro-amounts (a few dust-like particles or a single fibre), as we want to be as non-invasive as possible to the artefact or artwork. However, these samples are further complicated by the mixing of different materials, ageing and degradation.
Furthermore, there is a lack of references for identification as materials used to create the object may no longer be available or were self-concocted by the artists. Besides technical difficulties, it is also important for us to have clear communication with our colleagues from the various fields, in order to facilitate a two-way exchange of such niche information.
What else inspires us to do this work?
L:
Every question we answer, or â€˜mystery' we solve, brings us closer to the truth. Much like detective work.
XM:
We get to reveal untold secrets, and verify information about ancient artefacts, which enables us to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of history, art and culture. Conservation Science also contributes to the conservation of damaged artefacts, preservation of the authenticity of artefacts, and most importantly, ensuring they are passed down to future generations as accurately as possible. This is what inspires me to do better work. It may be a relatively new field, with many novel and exciting applications being explored at such a rapid rate, it's truly inspirational on both the scientific and arts front.
Help us raise awareness for art conservation and the science behind it!
L:
9 in 10, or sometimes even 10 out of 10, people who visit the HCC may say it is their first visit, and more surprising, that they did not know heritage conservation exists in Singapore! Half of them admit to understanding or have come across art conservation, but probably none have heard of conservation science. In recent years though, there have been more people who have come to know about our work, through our continued efforts to share and collaborate with others.
XM:
Yes, those numbers do not lie! Every time I tell people what I do, the first response I get is â€˜So, you authenticate stuff?' I will then re-emphasize that our analyses are meant to understand the artefacts better for conservation purposes, not to authenticate the artefacts.
If I were not a part of the HCC, I would not have known that such roles existed in Singapore. So, I do believe that more can be done to spread public awareness on what we do here, which is what our communications department at NHB has been actively doing.
To date, we have upped our digital presence with outreach videos on social media, and written articles (much like this one!) on our website. Most recently, â€˜An Old New World' exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore featured sections on Conservation and Conservation Science in their brochure. We have a very open office environment and conduct lab tours for the public, where they can see us, and the conservators alike, in action. For any students reading this, we do host internships to develop interest and potential in our field.

What is intangible cultural heritage?
Under the 2003 UNESCO Convention for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is defined as cultural practices and living traditions which reflect cultural diversity and creative expression, and provide communities with a sense of belonging.
In Singapore, ICH can be broadly classified into six categories: oral traditions and expressions; performing arts; social practices, rituals and festive events; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; food heritage; and traditional craftsmanship.
ICH is part of our living heritage and continues to evolve with time. ICH fosters a sense of identity amongst the different communities and contributes to the vibrancy of Singapore's multicultural heritage. It is therefore important that we document and safeguard our ICH for future generations.

Kreta Ayer: Cultural Heartland of Chinatown
The boundaries of present-day Chinatown were established in 1822 and its origin can be attributed to Sir Stamford Raffles. This is because Raffles organised the town of Singapore according to ethnicity as a way of preserving communal harmony, as well as facilitating trade by locating ethnic groups involved in commerce closer to the port. The historic district of Chinatown today consists of four sub-districts: Telok Ayer, Kreta Ayer, Tanjong Pagar and Bukit Pasoh.
Among the four sub-districts, Kreta Ayer Road and its neighbouring streets formed the commercial heart of Chinatown. The name â€œKreta Ayerâ€ means â€œwater cartâ€ in Malay, which refers to the bullock and ox carts that plied Kreta Ayer Road in the mid-1800s. These carts were used to distribute water from wells located in Ann Siang Hill.
The early immigrants of Kreta Ayer, who were predominantly Cantonese, brought with them traditional and cultural traits from their hometowns in China. Kreta Ayer soon became a cultural heartland known for its concentration of teahouses and opera theatres. It was also home to other traditional arts such as nanyin music, lion dance and wushu, which are examples of ICH that are still practised in Chinatown today.

Chinese Opera
Chinese opera is a performing art form rooted in Chinese tradition and staged with stylised actions and elaborate costumes. Music, acting, martial arts and acrobatics are key features across various genres of Chinese opera. Opera performances often draw upon Chinese folklore, history or literature, and showcase aspects of Chinese culture, tradition and philosophy.
Known locally as â€œwayangâ€ in Malay, Chinese opera was the most popular form of local live entertainment for more than a century in Singapore. Introduced by Chinese migrants in the 19th century, it was often performed at religious festivities in honour of deities such as Ma Zu (goddess and protector of seafarers), Guan Yin (goddess of mercy) and Guan Di (god of war and protector of tradesmen). Presented on makeshift stages, opera performances were often sponsored by temples and clans, and staged for free public viewing.
Between the late 1800s and 1930s, the Chinese opera scene in Singapore was thriving and the 1881 census recorded a total of 240 Chinese opera performers. In fact, Chinese opera became so popular here during its heyday that Singapore was known as the â€œsecond homeland of Cantonese operaâ€ outside of Hong Kong and China!

As evidence of the popularity of Chinese opera during that time, throngs of enthusiastic fans could be seen surrounding the performers as they leave the theatre.
Opera Houses
As the popularity of Chinese opera increased, opera houses that could accommodate hundreds of patrons were built in Chinatown to stage shows on a daily basis. Established in 1887 along Smith Street, Lai Chun Yuen was the first opera house dedicated to Cantonese opera and staged performances twice a day. Other notable opera houses include Heng Seng Peng and Heng Wai Sun at Wayang Street (today's Eu Tong Sen Street).
Another well-known venue is Tien Yien Moi Toi Theatre (former Majestic Theatre), built in 1927 by tycoon Eu Tong Sen, reportedly for his wife who was an avid opera fan. In the early years of its inception, it attracted glamorous opera stars from China before it was converted into a cinema in 1938.
In the early 20th century, Chinese teahouses were also popular venues for opera performances. The teahouse at Great Southern Hotel, colloquially known as Nam Tin, drew crowds with regular qingchang (Mandarin for â€œpure singingâ€) performances which involve solo or group renditions of operatic excerpts accompanied by a small group of musicians.

Elements of Chinese Opera
Costumes
In general, Chinese opera costumes can be divided into five categories, namely mang (four-clawed dragon robe), pei (informal robe for the elite), kao (armour), zhe (robe for commoners) and yi, (other costumes).
The costumes help audiences identify the role of each character, whose social standing is reflected in the costumes. Costumes with more elaborate designs are typically worn by important and powerful figures while simpler ones are reserved for those with a low status. Most costumes make reference to clothing from historical periods such as the Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644), which was the golden era of Chinese opera.

Music
Music in Chinese opera can be divided into two categories: wen (Mandarin for â€œcivilâ€) and wu (Mandarin for â€œmilitaryâ€). Wen music comprises string and wind instruments that accompany characters such as scholars and court ladies. Wu music uses percussion instruments in dramatic moments such as hand-to-hand combat and battle scenes.
Characters
Characters in a Chinese opera are generally classified into four types: dan (female characters); sheng (male characters); jing (male characters with painted faces); and chou (clown). Each character type has its own distinct make-up, costume and performance style. Typically, a performer would specialise in a specific role and refine his or her portrayal of the character over time.

This is a typical costume worn by an actor playing a male general during battle scenes in a Chinese opera performance. The body of the costume is usually covered in scale-like motifs, which are modelled after ancient Chinese amour. The four triangular flags attached to the back of the costume are a reference to pennants of command awarded to generals in the past. They also symbolise preparedness for war, and heightens the costume's dramatic effect. The flags can be removed after the battle scene is completed.
Kao is also worn by an actor playing a female general during battle scenes in a Chinese opera performance. Compared to the male general's costume, female kao costumes tend to incorporate a shoulder cape and more feminine touches such as tassels.
Local Dialect Forms of Chinese Opera
Cantonese opera, Hokkien opera and Teochew opera were and remain the three most common regional forms of opera staged in Singapore. The different genres of opera could be found in different quarters: Cantonese opera was predominantly performed in Kreta Ayer, Hokkien opera in the vicinity of Nankin Street and Hokien Street, and Teochew opera around Merchant Road and New Market Road.
Cantonese Opera
Cantonese opera (yueju) is performed in the Cantonese dialect and one of its key characteristics lies in its elaborately embroidered costumes that showcase strong regional influence from Guangdong. The costumes are usually made of silk and satin, and dyed in bright colours that have symbolic meanings. For example, yellow represents respectability, red embodies integrity, and black denotes forthrightness.
Performers also don simple but striking make-up, paired with a bright red lipstick. While most opera genres feature the common â€œwhite and red faceâ€, Cantonese opera tends to emphasise the red highlights around the eyes and on the cheeks, as well as a sharp contouring of the nose.

Teochew Opera
Teochew opera (chaoju) is performed in the Teochew dialect and involves colourful costumes and stylised movements. Although the costumes are vibrant and detailed, they are usually not as ornate as their Cantonese counterparts. This genre is also known for its variety of clown (chou) characters, and it is common to see multiple clown characters appearing in a single Teochew opera performance.
Teochew opera is also closely associated with street performances, where a temporary stage is constructed in open areas. These performances are conducted by professional troupes, such as Sing Yong Hoe Heng Teochew Wayang. The oldest of these troupes is Lao Sai Tao Yuan Teochew Opera Troupe, which was established in the 1850s and is the oldest surviving troupe in Singapore.

Hokkien Opera
Hokkien opera (in the form of minju, gezaixi, gaojiaxi, liyuanxi, xiangju) is performed in the Hokkien dialects, and is usually based on folk tales from the Fujian province in China. As most performances are narrated using colloquial language, Hokkien opera is one of the most popular genres of Chinese opera. Folk music (xiaodiao) is also used in performances and such music often possesses a catchy melody, which adds to the genre's popularity.
Like Teochew opera, Hokkien opera is also associated with street performances. However, unlike its Teochew and Cantonese counterparts, Hokkien opera is known for its improvisation and, in more contemporary times, for using modern musical instruments. One of the most prominent professional Hokkien groups was Sin Sai Hong Hokkien Wayang, which had a history dating back to 1910.

Memories of Chinese Opera
â€œI became interested in Cantonese opera as a child because I watched opera performances regularly with my aunt. I used to listen to Cantonese operas from my father's collection of vinyl records and attended singing classes at a clan association. While I never had formal Chinese lessons, I learned to read and write the language on my own by singing and reading opera lyrics.
I was so excited to make my debut as lead actress for Madam White Snake in 1968. I wanted to preserve Cantonese opera, so I set up Chinese Theatre Circle in 1981 with my husband Leslie. We have performed all over the world! I even came up with new ideas like singing opera in English and having English subtitles to help more people appreciate opera. The past 60 years have not been easy, but opera is something I will never give up. My focus now is on nurturing young talent and directing shows.â€
â€“ Joanna Wong, whose efforts and achievements in reviving Cantonese opera earned her the prestigious Cultural Medallion in 1981

â€œMy father Chat Thye Poh left China in his teens and first settled in Malaysia, where he trained as an opera apprentice under his mentor. In 1951, he moved to Singapore and made Chinatown his home. He told me that he paid weekly visits to Part Woh Wui Koon (Cantonese Opera Artistes Guild) in Keong Saik Road to seek out potential job opportunities with opera troupe owners.

Over the years, he became a popular Cantonese opera actor skilled in both civilian and military-type roles. He used to travel all over Singapore and Malaysia for work, and performed at different makeshift venues across Chinatown, such as Pagoda Street, Mosque Street and Banda Hill.â€
â€“- Cindy Chat, whose father was a popular Cantonese opera actor in Chinatown in the 1950s and 60s
Chinese Puppet Theatre
Chinese puppet theatre arrived in Singapore from southern China in the late 1800s to early 1900s. Like Chinese opera, Chinese puppet theatre was another form of popular entertainment for the masses. Puppet shows were usually held on a temporary stage, often along the streets or within a temple compound. Occasionally, troupes were also hired to perform for private events such as birthdays or weddings.
Chinese opera and Chinese puppet theatre are closely associated. Like Chinese opera, Chinese puppetry is linked to the Buddhist-Taoist faith and is usually staged to celebrate the feast days of deities. Performers of Chinese puppet theatre were sometimes former opera actors who could employ their singing skills for the puppets' voices. However, these former opera actors would still need to master the techniques necessary to manoeuver the puppets.
Puppet shows continue to entertain both locals and foreign visitors around Chinatown today, mostly during festive or religious occasions. In an attempt to attract younger audiences, puppet troupes such as Sin Hoe Ping incorporate modern puppets as well as a variety of puppets, such as string puppets and glove puppets, in the same play.

Common Types of Puppetry in Singapore
In Singapore, the common genres of Chinese puppetry include Hokkien glove puppetry, Teochew iron-stick puppetry, Hainanese rod puppetry and Henghua string puppetry.
The Hokkien glove puppet is between 25 to 35cm in length. The puppeteer controls the puppet's movements with his hand and fingers, which are fully inserted into the body of the puppet. Only the arms of the puppeteer are exposed on stage, as he controls his puppet from beneath the stage.
The Teochew iron-stick puppet is approximately 35cm in length. Three iron sticks are connected to the puppet: one to support the puppet head made of clay or papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and the other two for the puppeteer to manoeuver during a performance.
The Hainanese rod puppet measures between 60 to 70cm in length. It has a middle rod which controls the head and two thinner rods at the base for manoeuvring its movements.
The Henghua string puppet is at least 80cm in length and has twelve strings. Additional strings can be attached to perform the trickier and more elaborate movements. At the peak of its popularity in the 1950s, the Henghua genre dominated the Chinese puppetry art scene in Singapore.

Nanyin, Music of the South
Nanyin, literally meaning â€œmusic of the southâ€ in Mandarin, is a musical art form that is performed using vocals and a specific set of wind, string and percussion instruments. Its origin can be traced to Tang dynasty court music, as well as cultural traditions from the Song, Yuan and Ming periods. Nanyin flourished during the Ming and Qing periods in Fujian province, from where the art form was later brought to Singapore by Chinese immigrants in the 1800s.
Nanyin grew in popularity among Singapore's early Chinese settlers as its familiar sounds served as an emotional link to their homeland. The cultural art form is usually played alongside Chinese opera performances, or during events such as temple festivals or private celebrations. Nanyin musicians also formed societies based on dialect or kinship, which enabled them to connect with kinsmen from the same hometown.
Today, nanyin is still performed in temples such as Thian Hock Keng, one of Singapore's oldest Hokkien temples. In fact, Thian Hock Keng continues to uphold an age-old tradition of hosting nanyin performances in honour of the deity Guan Yin. The cultural art form is also practised by various musical groups such as Siong Leng Musical Association.

Forms of Nanyin
Fujian Nanyin
The Fujian genre of nanyin uses the Hokkien dialect of Fujian province and instrumental music. It is transmitted through a long tradition of music that is expressed in three forms: instrumental suites; suites with instrumental and vocal parts; and ballads accompanied by an ensemble. Nanyin is integral to the cultural identity of Fujian province and is commonly described as the region's â€œmother musicâ€ (muyue).
A nanyin performance is typically led by a solo vocalist who is accompanied by instruments such as pipa (four-stringed lute), dongxiao (bamboo flute), sanxian (three-stringed lute) and erxian (two-stringed bowed fiddle) as well as percussion instruments such as ban (wooden clappers to maintain rhythm). Traditionally, the pipa serves as the leading instrument and is used to provide the main melody.

Cantonese Naam-Yam
Cantonese nanyin, known as naam-yam in Cantonese, differs from Fujian nanyin in language, musical style, repertoire and instruments used. The genre of naam-yam comprises narrative singing where stories are vocalised through song. Naam-yam is usually performed using guzheng (Chinese zither), yehu (bowed lute made of coconut shell) or yangqin (hammered dulcimer), as well as ban. The lyrics of naam-yam are often melancholic and sombre, and revolve around the themes of heartbreak and struggle.
Naam-yam was once a popular form of entertainment among the Cantonese community in Kreta Ayer before the 1950s. Today, although naam-yam is rarely performed in its traditional form, some of its singing techniques have been adopted in Cantonese opera performances.
The musical instruments and score book on display were used by the Siong Leng Musical Association for their nanyin performances. Founded in 1941, Siong Leng is widely recognised for its contributions in promoting and preserving traditional nanyin music. Under former chairman Teng Mah Seng's leadership, the association won third prize in the folk solo category at the 37th Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod.

Chinese Calligraphy
Calligraphy was once an essential part of everyday life for the Chinese community as it served as the primary form of written communication. It was used in the writing of personal letters, advertisements, plaques and even road signs. Chinese calligraphy also serves as a means of expression and self-cultivation employed by poets, artists and intellectuals in their artistic and literary endeavours.
The tradition of Chinese calligraphy was brought to Singapore by Chinese immigrants. In the early 1900s, calligraphy was taught in Chinese-language schools such as Tuan Mong High School and Chung Cheng High School. In the 1900s, there was also a market for calligraphy signboards and such signboards can still be found hanging above the entrances of shops, temples and cultural associations in Chinatown.
Today, Chinese calligraphy is still appreciated for its timeless artistic and cultural values. While it is not as widely practiced as before, calligraphy is still taught in some schools as well as at community centres and cultural institutions. Calligraphy competitions, such as the annual National Calligraphy Hui Chun Competition, are organised regularly, and calligraphic paintings are also displayed in museums and exhibitions.

First Generation Calligraphers in Singapore
Tan Heng Fu (1870-1953)
Tan Heng Fu was a former Qing dynasty scholar who migrated to Singapore from Xinhui district in Guangdong, China when he was 62 years old. Tan was a skilled calligrapher and the artist behind the five Chinese characters on the faÃ§ade of Majestic Theatre. The characters bear the building's old place name of Tien Yien Dai Moh Toi, when it housed a Chinese opera theatre.
Wu Wei Ruo (1900-1980)
Wu Wei Ruo was a native of Dabu in Guangdong province who migrated to Singapore at age 13. Over time, he became highly sought after by local merchants who commissioned him to produce calligraphy for their signboards. These signboards can still be found outside Poh Seng Jewellers and Tiong Shian Coffee Shop along New Bridge Road.
Xu Yun Zhi, (1890-1960)
Xu Yun Zhi was a former teacher in his hometown in Kinmen County before coming to Singapore to work at Overseas Chinese Bank Corporation. He was one of the founders of Khoh Clan Association and served as Director of General Affairs at Kim Mui Hoey Kuan. Xu's calligraphic works can be found on the building faÃ§ades of Khoh Clan Association along Amoy Street and Chung Hwa Free Clinic at Telok Ayer Street.
Pan Shou, (1911â€“1999)
Pan Shou was born in Nan'an, Fujian Province, and migrated to Singapore in 1929 at the age of 19. Pan became the first calligrapher to be awarded the Cultural Medallion in 1987, and his calligraphy can be found on the faÃ§ade of the Siong Leng Musical Association building along Bukit Pasoh Road. Pan wrote the five characters of the association's name in 1992, as well as his name and the date of the inscription.
Traditional Chinese Teahouse and Tea Appreciation
In the early 20th century, traditional Chinese teahouses were important social spaces for the Chinese community where patrons could meet to mingle and be entertained. The patrons of these teahouses would drink tea and chat with friends while enjoying Chinese opera or nanyin performances at the same time.
Tea Appreciation
The origin of Chinese tea dates back to more than 3,000 years ago when the plant was used as a medicinal remedy in China. Due to its detoxifying and reinvigorating qualities, tea is widely consumed by people from all walks of life, and has become an integral part of Chinese culture, playing important roles in religious rituals, social customs and food heritage.
The act of brewing and drinking tea is regarded as a cultural art form. Tea brewers will match the selected tea with the right tea wares, infuse tea leaves in freshly boiled water, and pour tea into individual serving cups. There are different methods of brewing for different types of tea. For example, green tea is best brewed using a moderately high temperature while red tea will take a longer time to brew as its leaves are thicker.
Although tea has a long history, the import of tea into Singapore only started in 1819 when the British established Singapore as a trading post. During the period, local tea merchants imported tea from the Fujian province in China, and later from Taiwan from the late 1940s onwards. Due to strong local demand for tea, a number of tea firms were established in the 1920-30s, including Pek Sin Choon Tea Merchant, Guan Chong Bee Tea Merchant and the former Lim Kim Thye Tea Merchant.

Living Traditions
As Singapore transitions into the 21st century, new and alternative forms of entertainment such as digital games, movies and the internet have become popular. Consequently, cultural art forms such as Chinese opera and puppetry etc. are increasingly seen as leisure activities of the past. Nevertheless, devoted practitioners and stalwart supporters have continued to preserve and promote these cultural art forms to the younger generation.
In an effort to reach out to multicultural and younger audiences, some of these practitioners and performing troupes have introduced innovations into their cultural art forms by using different instruments, infusing other art forms, incorporating multi-media elements and even using English subtitles. Others have stepped up their outreach efforts to schools, community centres and museums in order to reach out to new audiences.

â€œThere is probably no city in the world with such a motley crowd of itinerant vendors of wares, fruits, cakes, vegetablesâ€¦â€ wrote author John Cameron of Singapore in the 1860s. Indeed, Singapore is home to diverse hawkers and hawking practices accompanied by a vast material culture. 
Get a glimpse of the myriad ways in which hawkers were represented. Learn about the practical struggles they faced, the environments they operated in, and shifts in hawking practicesâ€”including stricter licensing and regulationsâ€”that led to the birth of integrated food spaces or the hawker centres in Singapore that we know of today. Discover also, the tools and utensils of their trade, and how this was intricately tied to the experience of eating hawker food. 
See how our rich hawker heritage, having evolved with technological advancements and shifting consumer tastes, continue to define Singapore's social and culinary experiences.

Hawkers of the Past
Hawkers in Singapore have been written about, photographed, sketched and represented since the late 19th century. From the exoticised figure posed in a studio, to the gritty, realist picture of a humble man selling his wares on the street, and even the nostalgic rendering of a bygone tradesman, the varied ways in which hawkers have been represented reveal the diversity and ubiquitousness of their trade.

  Hawkers at Work
Hawkers were commonly found in places where people would gatherâ€”on the streets, at the riverside and in rural areas. Carrying their wares under the harsh sun or laying out their produce for sale, these itinerant vendors were easy to spot. 
The following images of hawkers at work not only reveal the physical labour involved in their trade, but also their social status and the precarious life they led. Aided by advanced camera and printing technologies, amateur photographersâ€”many of whom were tourists, travellers and localsâ€”captured these snapshots of everyday life of food vendors in Singapore.

Licence to Operate
While food hawking offered a livelihood for many, especially the impoverished, their itinerancy posed a problem for the authorities. Hawkers were perceived as unsightly, a threat to public health, and were also associated with criminals. To address these issues, the Hawkers Advisory Committee (1931) and Hawker Inquiry Commission (1950) were set up to regulate vendors.
The government even carried out an island-wide registration exercise from the 1960s to the 1980s, relocating hawkers from the main streets to the side or back lanes and stepping up enforcements against illegal hawking. Designated spaces for hawkers such as markets and hawker centres were also constructed.

Mobile Kitchens
Hawkers employed a wide range of tools and equipment to carry out their trade. These include (1) transportation aids such as kandar (wooden or bamboo) poles, baskets, carriers and carts that were used to fit their cooking equipment or store their cooked food, (2) devices such as kerosene lamps that were used to light up their street stalls at night, as well as (3) utensils and cutlery which hawkers used to cook and serve their dishes. For many of the roving hawkers, portability and durability were key considerations in selecting their tools. Some of these tools are still being used by hawkers today.

Whipping up Familiar Favourites
Have you ever wondered how popular hawker dishes such as satay (skewered meat) and chicken rice are prepared? You will be surprised at some of the practical and ingenuous ways that hawkers used to cook and promote these local favourites. From intricate moulds for kueh bahulu (mini sponge cakes) to charcoal grills for satay, the uniqueness of some of these cooking utensils and implements are as iconic as the dishes themselves, and a testament to the diversity of our hawker cuisine.

Time to Eat
Back in the day, when hawkers lined five-foot ways (covered walkways) and peddlers roamed the streets, customers sat on stools and low tables along the roadside to have their meals. These pushcarts or low tables were equipped with eating utensils such as chopsticks and bowls, so customers would eat in front ofâ€”or nearâ€”the hawkers. In some cases, they even propped themselves onto a high stool and used the cart itself as a tabletop. Peddlers and street hawkers had to co-exist with shophouse owners, and this continued even with the introduction of more organised, designated areas for street hawking.

Have a Sip
How did our drinking utensils and environments evolve? Whether it was the shift from using manual coffee grinders to automated grinding machines, or how we used to have tea at makeshift stalls but now gather at a kopitiam (coffee shop), the ways in which our drinking culture and material have changed tells a rich story of consumer habits and tastes.
With technological advancements, beverage manufacturers also began to embrace innovative packaging. While consumers were used to drinking out of traditional porcelain cups and glass bottles, portable canned drinks, and later, Tetra Paks, brought greater convenience to them and hawkers alike.

Brewing Nostalgia: Kopitiams
Coffee is best enjoyed leisurely, and the open space as well as loosely arranged furniture in Singapore's traditional kopitiams (coffee shops) create an informal setting and ambience of leisure conducive for this. With a constant supply of hot and affordable beverages, kopitiams encouraged socialisation and casual conversation within the community.
The kopitiam furniture featured here have become iconic. As examples of local design, they also show the influences of late 19th and early 20th century international forms and techniques in furniture making.

A National Treasure Trove
Opened in 2000, the Heritage Conservation Centre (HCC) is a purpose-built facility located on Jurong Port Road that serves as the repository of the National Collection (NC). It houses more than 250,000 artefacts and artworks in climate-controlled stores and conservation laboratories. Here, a dedicated team of cataloguers, collections managers, conservators, estates and support staff, photographers and scientists strive to manage and care for them to the highest professional standards.
As a part of wider efforts to make the NC accessible to the public, HCC plays a crucial role in supporting museum exhibitions such as An Old New World which was at National Museum Singapore (NMS) in 2019. Here at the HCC, we document and capture important information about the artefacts and artworks and prepare them for both physical and online display. We see to it that they are inventoried, and safely packed and transported to the museums. We work with our colleagues at the museums to ensure that the artefacts are displayed using methods and materials that are as safe as possible for the artefacts. For online display, besides including well taken photographs, we ensure that the artefact records are tagged with suitable metadata to enhance their searchability.
These essential processes are often unseen, unnoticed and unknown to the public. Check out this mini-series for information on the HCC and its different departments. Learn about the work done behind the scenes by the team in caring for the NC, whether on a regular basis or in preparation for museum exhibitions.

HCC in 2000 (left); 20 years later, HCC in 2020 (right)
The original building opened in 2000 was a four-storey building. Due to the growing number of artefacts and artworks, the building was renovated into a six-storey building in 2008 â€“ 2010 to create more space.
As HCC houses Singapore's NC of artefacts and artworks, the building is purpose-built to preserve and conserve the collection of artefacts and artworks. The design of the building is shaped by physical site constraints and functionality.  The Loading Bay, Security Control Room and Building Automation Control Room are all located at the front of the building on the ground floor to minimise circulation requirements. It also offers the benefit of immediate building control and the optimum efficient arrangement for artefacts delivery, loading and control. The five storeys above consist of repository rooms, a viewing room, conservation laboratories and administrative offices. The floors are sealed with epoxy coating to minimise dust pollution. The custom-built steel doors, measuring 3.5m by 2.3m, are among the largest steel doors in Singapore. The walls are concreteâ€“reinforced and aluminiumâ€“clad, for security reasons and to insulate all artefacts in the building. The building is designed with minimal windows. This also prevents sunlight from entering the building, which can harm the artefacts. The design also takes into account separate access to the artefact collections areas and building amenities; allowing access to areas with collections to be limited to authorised personnel only.
The images below depict the interior of the building when it was completed in 2000, before all the stores were filled. These spaces and structures remain the same till today.

The Management & Operations Group (MOG) is the corporate services arm of HCC and the key functions that it oversees include estates management, outreach, capability development, finance and office administration. HCC is continuously improving its infrastructure to ensure a conducive and safe working environment as well as to enhance the security and efficiency of the building.  HCC also organises tours to our facility and workshops to share about how we conduct collections management and our conservation efforts. Read on to find out more about two tasks carried out by MOG colleagues.
Outreach
HCC conducts outreach programmes to promote understanding, appreciation and awareness of preservation and conservation of heritage materials amongst the wider heritage community. Our key outreach programmes include organised tours at HCC and workshops to share knowledge about collections management and conservation. We also conduct heritage awareness tours for schools.
Our tours allow visitors to peek into how our cultural heritage materials are preserved for posterity. During tours, visitors learn how historical artefacts, works of art and fine antiquities are preserved by proper environmental control, good physical storage and storage methods, and other preventive conservation measures to avert deterioration. They would also get a glimpse of artefacts undergoing conservation treatment in the laboratories. Visitors are introduced to the collection management and conservation professions, careers that are crucial in heritage preservation but relatively unheard of in Singapore.
HCC Tour welcome and introduction briefing by Kathleen.
Estates Management
The Estates Management team manages building maintenance works in supporting HCC's operations. The team ensures the building meets statutory requirements by carrying out testing and inspection works. Security is of the utmost importance as Singapore's heritage assets are stored in this building. There is a strict security system for access, which includes card access, closed-circuit TV, intrusion detection system. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) are monitored and controlled to ensure the environment where the different artefacts are stored is stable and suitable. As there are artefacts which are sensitive to water such as the archival collection, the Estates Management team also oversees the Inergen gas system which can put out fires without using water. The other tasks that the Estates Management team include managing contract workers for cleaning, building maintenance, landscape, and pest control.

Prevention is Better Than Cure
by Ang Boon Kok
Besides the MOG overseeing the building maintenance aspect, the Prevention Conservation Work Group at HCC also looks at prolonging the life span of an artefact through the practice of preventive conservation. As the name suggests, this function of conservation aims to prevent or slow down the rate of deterioration of artefacts by managing various factors like the environment in which artefacts are stored, pests, mould growth and even how artefacts are handled and transported.
While conservation treatment procedures such as surface cleaning and crease relaxation help to improve the condition and appearance of artefacts, there is another important aspect to prolonging their life span â€“ preventive conservation. As its name suggests, this function of conservation aims to prevent or slow down the rate of deterioration of artefacts, and is done through managing various factors like the environment in which artefacts are stored, pests, mould growth, and even how artefacts are handled and transported. In an exhibition, one of the ways in which appropriate environmental conditions can be provided for different types of artefacts is through the use of a well-designed showcase.
How do we minimise the deterioration of an artefact?

To delay or prevent the deterioration of an artefact, we practise preventive conservation through controlling its immediate environment. Artefacts may deteriorate due to the following factors:
Effects of Temperature and RH fluctuations
Constant rapid fluctuations of temperature and relative humidity can result in warping, splitting, and delamination of certain sensitive material types.
Graphs of temperature (yellow) and RH (blue) over time. (Left) Readings stay within acceptable range. (Right) This shows large fluctuations in readings that are also constantly out of recommended ranges.
In addition, artefacts are also vulnerable to other agents of deterioration, such as:

What makes Singapore, Singapore? And what makes Singapore home? @ Home, Truly, follow Nadine, and her Gong Gong (Mandarin for ""grandfather"") as they relive the highs, lows, and moments in between of Singapore's journey from its beginnings as a nation to today.
Each chapter in this digital experience is illustrated by a different artist, in their own inimitable style. Check back every month for updates as our story unfolds!
This experience is presented in collaboration with The Straits Times. This is the second chapter of the story, and it features Singapore's playscapes, past and present. Read on, or click here to explore other chapters!
We hope you stay a while, and make yourself at home, truly!

Hello, meet Nadine and her Gong Gong! Nadine is nine, and Gong Gong isâ€¦ Well, he's much older than her, of course. Nadine has come to stay with him as her parents have to work for long hours during these unusual COVID-19 times.
Nadine loves her Gong Gong, but as they reach his home in Punggol, she feels anxious about being away from home. She is a little afraid of the dark â€“ how will she sleep without her Appa's (Tamil for â€œfatherâ€) bedtime stories, and without her favourite moon light?
Gong Gong tells Nadine they can explore the world outside, indoors! â€œIt's the doors of our minds we will open!â€, he exclaims.
Psst! This chapter's illustrator is Lee Xin Li, who uses illustration to explore Singapore's heritage, to connect with a home that he feels is rapidly changing. In his drawings, Xin Li juxtaposes layers of culture, history, architecture and nature with personal references to pop culture or childhood.
Once Upon a Punggol
Gong Gong tells Nadine to close her eyes. They're still in Punggol, but they're in the Punggol of years and years ago â€“ when all these tall HDB flats were yet to be imagined, when Punggol had farms and was most famous for its seafood restaurants andâ€¦ a zoo!
The â€œSingapore Zooâ€ was once located at Punggol. This public zoo and bird park was established in 1928 by Mr William Lawrence Soma Basapa, an estate owner, animal trader, and collector of exotic pets. At the zoo, there were orang utans, tapirs, crown pigeons, and a Bengal tiger named Apay, who was also Mr Basapa's favourite pet.
In The Lights of Singapore by Roland Braddell (1934), an early travel guide of sorts, a trip to this zoo is described as â€œone of the things that no visitor should omit; it has a personality entirely on its ownâ€! This zoo closed down before the Japanese Occupation.
There was another zoo set up in Punggol in 1958, which closed in the 1980s. The entrance to this zoo, with the words â€œSingapore Zooâ€, is depicted in the illustration!
Before the land started to be developed for residential use in the 1970s, Punggol was far away from the city â€“ and perhaps only close to the sea. Because of that, it was thought of as a recreational retreat, with seafood restaurants and water sports options. Visitors to some of the restaurants could eat freshly caught seafood from the surrounding waters!

Apart from the exotic animals at the zoo, there were other animals in Punggol â€“ pigs. Pig farming was concentrated in Punggol from the 1970s. Traditional pig farms from all over the island were consolidated and resettled there. However, by November 1990, pig farms were completely phased out due to pollution and intensive use of land and water, and pork was instead imported.

Ask Someone! What do you like the most about your neighbourhood? What are the common sights, sounds and smells that you experience there?
It's a Great, Happy, New World
â€œâ€¦So you see, Nadine, sometimes we can go places without going out!â€ Gong Gong seems even more excited than Nadine is about this activity. â€œNadine, how many worlds do we live in?â€ â€œHuh? Isn't there just one world?â€ Gong Gong has a gleam in his eye when he replies, â€œDid you know Singapore used to have three worlds? Gay World, New World, and Great World! They were amusement parks with cinemas and restaurants, before we had shopping malls.â€
â€œYour Po Po and I went on our very first date at Gay World! By that time, people were starting to have their own TV sets at home, and there were supermarkets sprouting all over the island. People stopped finding amusement parks amusing. But Po Po and I both thought Gay World was an interesting place with lots to explore!â€
The â€œWorldsâ€, built between the 1920s and 1930s, evolved through time and contained all sorts of amusing attractions â€“ they had stadiums for sports events (like boxing matches), halls for dancing in, theatres for all kinds of plays and movies.
""During school days, we used to frequent the place. We paid about 10c for admission to go inâ€¦ It was very entertaining, they had many, many amusements. Many things to see. They even had a cafÃ©, a lot of cinemas, a lot of games. It was good to spend an evening there as a schoolboy because during that time, [there were not many entertainment outlets].""

â€œ[The ghost train ride was when] you sit in the train, then you go into the dark place, apartments, they have certain apartments. So certain time you reach certain place one ghost will come out. Then you reach another door, the door open, another funny funny ghost will come out, that kind of thing. So try and scare you off that kind of thing. It's all in darkness, they play with camera tricks and so on. So it was the most popular at the time.â€

The Worlds were also used as venues for weddings, and pre-weddings events - like match-making!
â€œAnd that was a place where parentsâ€¦ get wives for their sons. They had matchmakers in those daysâ€¦ It's usually the matchmaker from the man's side goes around and finds out about the girl's side. Then they made an arrangement for the mother to take the girl to the Great Worldâ€¦ and the man's sideâ€¦ gets to look only, not to talk or to meet. But the girl's side never knows anything about it until the actual day of the wedding, they get to see the bridegroom.â€

Everyday Play
There are smaller, but nonetheless significant, â€œworldsâ€ for Singaporeans to play in today. Parks and playgrounds are planned close to homes, as social and educational spaces for children, and pockets of play amid the many high-rise estates in Singapore.

Some of the spaces Singaporeans treasured the most were the concrete-and-sand playgrounds built in the 1970s â€“ many of which featured geometric designs, fruits, or animals (though the dragon could more accurately be called a mythological being).

This plan was drafted by Mr Khor Ean Ghee, the designer of the early playgrounds in Housing & Development Board (HDB) estates. Mr Khor drew inspiration from Singapore culture in his designs. On the dragon playground, he said:
â€œAsians can easily recognise dragons and phoenixes. It was not easy to combine the play with the shape of a phoenix, but I could design a dragon playground that allows for climbing and sliding while still keeping its shape.â€

From the 1990s, playgrounds in housing estates starting sporting new looks â€“ colourful plastic slides and bouncy rubber mats were used instead, for safety and hygiene reasons. Adult fitness areas were also incorporated into playgrounds for children, to encourage family bonding.

The Play Project, an aerial survey of 100 playgrounds across Singapore showed how ubiquitous â€œnewâ€ playgrounds seem ordinary â€“ yet, each one has their own personality and story. Each is a part of their unique landscape and neighbourhood.

Playgrounds in Singapore continue to evolve today, to suit changing needs and expectations. Some are â€œinclusive playgroundsâ€, with features such as this swing that wheelchair users can enjoy.
Ask Someone! Which is your favourite play space in Singapore, and why? (It could be a playground, a park, a shopping mall, a place in your home, anywhere!)
A Walk in the Park
Of course, there are even larger, and some quite exotic play-grounds. One such playscape is the Jurong Bird Park, which was officially opened on 3 January 1971. Some of the highlights in the park included a walk-in aviary and the Waterfall Aviary, with a 30.5-metre-high man-made waterfall and more than 600 free-flying birds

Jurong Bird Park, with its abundance of birds, is perhaps the best place to learn about collective nouns â€“ it is home to a parliament of owls (and secretary birds), a flamboyance of flamingoes, colonies of gulls, a concentration of kingfishers, and many more. How would you describe a group of cockatoos?
The park was also one of the highlights on the itinerary when Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh came on a state visit to Singapore in 1972. She is seen crossing the â€œBridge of Eternityâ€ in the photograph below.

While Jurong Bird Park will be moving to Mandai by 2022, the Singapore Botanic Gardens â€“ another beloved recreational space, will remain in its original location for posterity. Singapore's only UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Gardens, was inscribed in 2015 for its contributions to the global rubber industry (through the innovative and experimental work on rubber trees in the Gardens), and its preservation as a British tropical colonial garden.  
The garden is not only world famous, it's also dear to the hearts of many Singaporeans, as a venue for the celebration of festive events and milestone events like wedding engagements and graduation photoshoots.

The Gardens has also had a complex relationship with monkeys through the years. Monkeys have been regarded as a nuisance, a tourist attraction, and were even once employed as workers!
â€œA lot of problems, the monkeys. For one thing, it was a tourist attraction. People used to come and feed, and then they became vicious because the numbers increased and I don't think there were enough tourists to feed the lot! They were attacking the tourists. Any time you walk into the Gardens with an orange or what, they'll come, just chase you and grab the orange.â€
â€“ Arthur George Alphonso, in an oral history recording by the National Archives of Singapore

Under the directorship of E.J.H. Corner in the 1930s, trained â€œbotanical monkeysâ€ (Pig-tailed Macaques) were employed to collect botanical specimens from tall, inaccessible trees in the tropical forest. They were paid in rice, bananas and raw eggs. This practice had stopped by the time of the Japanese Occupation in the early 1940s, and the monkeys at the Gardens after that never quite seemed to be able to work in the same way.
The Straits Times, 3 May 1957, p. 4. â€œGarden monkeys are too dull to workâ€
â€œGong Gong, I love the Botanic Gardens! I like saying hello to the swans and the funny tree on our five-dollar note, and going for concerts and picnics with Appa and Mum!â€ â€œOh, that reminds me, once your Po Po and I brought your mum to the Botanic Gardensâ€¦â€

Collections Management
The Collections Management (CM) department at HCC is responsible for the management of and facilitating access to the National Collection (NC).  Management of the NC includes storage and documentation, such as accessioning and movement documentation. Collection stores are maintained to provide the best possible environment to store the artefacts e.g. at optimal temperature and humidity, good housekeeping and pest management.
Our Collections Managers and Officers also manage the movement of artefacts between the museums and HCC e.g. during installations and de-installations for exhibitions and storage, as well as movement of artefacts within HCC premises e.g. to conservation labs for treatment. One key activity of the CM department is the stocktake exercise, which is carried out together with our museum counterparts, to ensure that the NC is all accounted for.
In addition, the CM department includes the Knowledge and Information Management (KIM) section, which facilitates documentation and digital access for the NC.

Storage Matters
by Ang Boon Kok, Jia Han & Tan Xue Miao
At any point in time, only less than 10% of the NC is on display at exhibitions, while the rest are in storage. With more than 250,000 NCs, collections management therefore plays a crucial role in managing and caring for artefacts.
Collections management refers to the provision of physical care and management of the collection. In HCC, a team of dedicated Collections Managers are responsible for overseeing collections functions, which include preventive maintenance, storage, and documentation.
Besides that, Collections Managers also manage work procedures such as new artefact/artwork receiving, accessioning, and facilitating access to the NC.
What Happens to a Newly Acquired Artefact at HCC?
Watch: What Happens to a Newly Acquired Artefact at HCC?
  Types of Storage
As an institution managing collections of cultural heritage, space optimisation is an ongoing concern. Hence, we maximise storage space by designing storage to best suit each artefact type, and arranging the artefacts to best fit these storage spaces. The accessibility of artefacts is also taken into consideration, ensuring safe and efficient retrieval.

  Knowledge & Information Management
The Knowledge and Information Management (KIM) is part of the CM department. KIM looks into documentation and facilitating digital access to our NC. This includes visual documentation of the NC, maintenance of collections management and movement systems, and heritage cataloguing. Singapore Collections Management System (SCMS) and Automated Collections Tagging System (ACTS) are both used to manage the NC. SCMS is a centralised database of our NC and is used by all parties working on the NC to update information of the artefacts. Images of artefacts by our Photographers and heritage cataloguing information by our Cataloguers are also stored in SCMS. Some of this information is made available to the public via Collections page on Roots.sg. ACTS is a RFID system which manages the location of artefacts and facilitates stocktake of our NC. 
Learn more about some of the tasks carried out by our KIM Photographers and Cataloguers in the subsequent sections.
Visual Documentation (Photography)
by Dave Lee
Visual documentation of the NC started in the 1970s using film and transparencies. In 2001, NHB made the transition to digital photography. Most of the visual documentation takes place in the photography studio at HCC. Visual documentation is part of the accessioning process. The images produced are used for multiple purposes, including in exhibition catalogues and online publishing. 
Two types of cameras are used for visual documentation at HCC: A 36 megapixel DSLR is used for most of the artefacts, while an 80 megapixel Medium Format Camera (MFC) is used for artefacts which require high colour accuracy or have a lot of fine detail. 
The Photographers' monitors are set to auto calibrate every 200 hours to ensure accuracy in colour display. This helps to ensure that the colour of the image captured is as close to the colour of the artefact as possible. NCs are photographed in native camera RAW format and processed to TIFF and JPEG formats for archival and publication purposes respectively.
Our in-house Photographer, Dave, takes us through his task of photographing large textile pieces below.
Dave is photographing a piece of textile (2009-02101) which is about 5m long. Due to its length, it has to be taken with this setup. Dave ensures that the lighting is even across the entire textile.
Photoshoot Sets for Artefacts at HCC
Different object types need different photography set-ups due to different forms, sizes and the materials of the artefacts. 2D and 3D artefacts require different set-ups because of the height and depth of 3D objects.

Guidelines for NC Artefact Photoshoot
HCC sees the benefits in developing standardised photo-documentation guidelines to communicate to both our stakeholders and partners on the process of how we photograph our NC. Check out the guidelines HCC developed to photograph artefacts using the set-ups mentioned above. 
There are two object types considered as 2D artefacts: a) Paper Artefacts; and b) Artefacts with a Flat Decorative Surface or artefacts that are unable to stand without support.

Heritage Cataloguing
by Afiqah Zainal & Ho Swee Ann
In this digital age, there are new ways to facilitate access to the artefacts in the NC beyond the museums' physical space. To tap on this potential, HCC started heritage cataloguing in 2014, which involves the attribution of metadata (terms/controlled vocabulary) to describe the artefacts in the collections digital database. The purpose of cataloguing is to organise and structure the digital artefact records to enhance search and retrieval of the artefacts on (1) the Collections page on Roots.sg (2) SCMS, our internal database, and (3) on other platforms such as digital interactives placed in the exhibition galleries at museums or heritage institutions.
Enhancing Digital Access
Tagging the artefacts with controlled vocabulary maintains a consistent use of metadata (terms) amongst the NC records which results in organised records for efficient search and retrieval. How is this done?
A Cataloguer reads and assesses the artefact's information that has been provided by the Curators, Collection Managers and Conservators. Additional research is then conducted to ensure the accuracy of terms used to describe the artefact. These terms are attributed according to a set list of cataloguing fields, such as the ones you see below.
Cataloguers refer to local and international thesauri to choose the most suitable terms to complete the above fields. Cataloguers ensure that the term's scope of use is applicable to describe the artefacts. [Examples of thesauri - Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), Library of Congress Authorities (LC), Getty's Thesauri of Geographic Names (TGN), NLB's Taxonomy and Thesaurus Editor (TTE)]
These terms are called controlled vocabularies â€“ standardised and organised terms to ensure consistency in artefact description; which aid in content organisation and online retrievals.
Check out how metadata created via heritage cataloguing can be used!
The artefact records are published on the Collections page on Roots.sg page on Roots.sg!
Digital Engagement Collaboration Project with NMS
The catalogued metadata and images taken by HCC Photographers may be used on digital platforms for various projects, such as the Interactive Discovery Map installed in An Old New World exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore from September 2019 â€“ March 2020. Let us walk you through a few selected features of the interactive in these images, if you had missed it at the exhibition.
Visitors were presented with an animated interface of an amalgamation of maps from Laurie & Whittle's Oriental Pilot (2018-00081). Small animated ships glided across the screen imitating the route operated by the British East India Company, passing by significant ports of interest during the late 18th century.
Classifying Artefacts in the NC
An example of NHB Object Type Taxonomy
Have you seen groups of objects arranged in a hierarchical manner? That's a taxonomy!
Cataloguers are also developing the NHB Taxonomy, of which the first is the Object Type Taxonomy. A taxonomy organises terms or concepts to reflect the relationships between/amongst NC, providing them with a structure. The NHB Object Type Taxonomy aims to organise the NC artefacts according to their form and function. The object type categories and labels establish hierarchical and associative relationships amongst them.
Hierarchical: Broader/Narrower Term relationships
Associative: Related Term relationships
Click here (coming soon) to explore the NHB Object Type Taxonomy which aids browsing of the NC artefacts on the Collections Classification page on Roots.sg.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Apsaras-Arts-Connecting-soul-to-soul-through-dance/story,"Since its establishment in 1977, Apsaras Arts has been engaging audiences through bharatanatyam and other classical dance forms. â€œAfter all, Indian classical dance is a storytelling art (where) you connect soul to soul with the audienceâ€, says the Singapore company's artistic director Aravinth Kumarasamy.

  Bharatanatyam and other dance forms like kathak, kuchipudy and mohiniattam employ subtle, intricate facial expressions, hand gestures, and body movements in combination with music, drama, costumes, and other aesthetics. Taken together, they engage audiences at many levels, from the sensory to the intellectual, from the emotional to the aesthetic and the spiritual.
The drive to engage audiences through their dance dramas has been characteristic of Apsaras since it was established by the late Neila Sathyalingam and Sangita Siromani Suntharalingam Sathyalingam. Today, Apsaras functions as a repertory company and a dance academy.
â€œWe are very keen to uplift the standards of Indian classical dance in Singapore, so we collaborate with the best in the world, and teach (students) not only dance (techniques) but also how to be a dancer and how to build a career in danceâ€, says Kumarasamy.
Classical roots and regional influences
While many of the ideals and narratives in Indian classical dance are rooted in Vedic texts including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the repertoires performed by Apsaras over more than four decades have also incorporated Singaporean elements, having evolved through multiple points of contact and intersections with a diverse array of cultures here.

At times, this Singaporean strand emerges when Apsaras adds a contemporary layer to the interconnections and crossings between the many cultures of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.
In 2017's Anjaneyam: Hanuman's Ramayana, which opened the Esplanade's Kalaa Utsavam festival before travelling internationally, Apsaras brought together dancers, choreographers, musicians and other performers from Singapore, Indonesia, and India, harmoniously blending bharatanatyam and Javanese dance forms accompanied by gamelan, Carnatic, and Hindustani raga music.
â€œWe feel we can be inspired by our neighbourhood, and there are lovely stories that we share in common with Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailandâ€, says Kumarasamy. â€œ(This has helped us) attract a different audience who are interested in heritage, traditions and Southeast Asia, and that makes our performances more interesting, to have varied audiences so that we are challenged to give them varied craft.â€
At other times, Apsaras presents different perspectives and employ fresh storytelling techniques, even as they stay true to their classical roots. Alapadma: The Lotus Unfolds explored aspects of the lotus' symbolism and iconography in Indian culture, including creation, romance, as well as its many meanings in different cultures across the world, with the dancers' movements choreographed to recall the blossoming of a lotus flower. Meanwhile, Agathi: The Plight of the Refugee showcased the experiences of refugees through imagery and sounds of their journeys.
Nurturing dance excellence across decades
The late co-founder Neila Sathyalingam, a Cultural Medallion award winner and a graduate of the famed Kalakshetra academy in Chennai, India, is also noted for her efforts to make Indian classical dance more inclusive and accessible in Singapore.
She ran training classes at grassroots level, and worked with the People's Association to establish troupes and choreographed dances for 13 consecutive Chingay parades. â€œ(Apsaras) has been able to train many aspiring youths from our heartlands and showcase them in both local and international platforms, breaking the misconception that Indian classical arts (are) only accessible to those in elite communitiesâ€, explains Kumarasamy.
Today, Apsaras' Little Angels programme, organised in collaboration with artists from the Malay and Chinese dance communities, provides training in a diverse array of dance styles for children. The company also offers the Balabharatham course for bharatanatyam fundamentals, and works closely with schools and grassroots organisations.
To provide platforms for its talents, Apsaras sustains the Darshana series which showcases young Singapore soloists, and continues to participate in international and regional festivals and dance productions. With the aim of deepening the appreciation of Indian dance and its cultural heritage, Apsaras also organises the annual Dance India Asia Pacific industry development programme, which includes master classes, workshops, dance education classes, panel discussions, and performances under its umbrella.
This dedication to make Indian classical dance inclusive and to transmit their craft has seen Apsaras nurture hundreds of dancers over the decades â€“ including Soo Mei Fei, who joined Apsaras in 2015, was mentored by Apsaras' principal dancer Mr Mohananpriyan Thavarajah, and became the first Singaporean Chinese woman to perform a full bharatanatyam recital on stage. Apsaras-trained performers have also gone on to found institutions of their own in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, France, and the United States, among others.

Mangrove forests are the â€œrainforests by the seaâ€. Found in the tropics, these forests, which grow at the interface between land and sea, consist of unique flora and fauna assemblages specially adapted to tolerate fluctuating salinities, muddy and anoxic soils1. In Singapore, the general public can get â€˜up close' to local mangroves in Pasir Ris Park, Pulau Ubin, Pulau Semakau and Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve, an ASEAN Heritage wetland site.
The mangrove forest - a unique ecosystem residing on the border of land and sea.
At first glance, walking through a place like Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve could lead to the mistaken conclusion that the biodiversity of mangrove forests is mainly restricted to homogenous trees and pesky mosquitoes. Cursory glances such as these have done little to promote the usefulness of mangrove forests and the rich biodiversity that lies beneath its deceptive exterior.
A Fragile Ecosystem
Throughout Singapore's history, it has been unfortunate that few have had the foresight to see past the seemingly â€˜dirty' exterior of mangrove forests and have thus unfairly labelled them as wastelands.
Since the 1960s, coastal habitats including mangrove swamps have been cleared en masse for the construction of residential and commercial sites, prawn ponds and land reclamation. These unique habitats which are home to a myriad of organisms have also been used as sites where industrial effluents are discharged and solid and metallic anthropogenic wastes are dumped2, 3, 4. In 1820, one year after the founding of modern Singapore, mangrove swamps covered about 13% of Singapore's fringe areas2. In 2010, these unique habitats represented less than 0.5% of Singapore's land area, concentrated mainly along the northern fringes of the country2.
The mangrove forests which remain are often very small and severely fragmented. The mangrove forests of today are no longer large enough to support big carnivores such as the tiger, which could be seen freely roaming the island in the early 19th century. The patchy distribution of trees along the most seaward portion of the mangroves have also resulted in a large amount of tree-falls due to strong winds and the strong waves produced in the wake of large ships travelling near the mangrove forest2.
Small and fragmented mangrove forests do not bode well for the long-term sustainability of what is left of Singapore's mangrove forests. Besides an increasing tree-fall rate, establishment of young mangrove trees has become increasingly difficult as there are less mature trees around to shield the young seedlings from strong waves that enter the mangrove forest during a rising tide. Should Singapore's mangrove forest remain unprotected and unconserved, Singapore may be losing a portion of her mangrove forests every year, along with their unique biodiversity and invaluable environmental services.
Providing a Service to Mankind
Mangrove forests contain plants and animals which provide man with useful materials, food and valuable coastal protection. Even till today, entire coastal communities in countries such as Thailand can be sustained through reliance on mangrove forest products5.
Controlled burning of mangrove tree wood can also provide charcoal which has applications more widespread than just barbeque starting. Charcoal is highly absorbent and is widely used in removing bad odours from air and water and to absorb harmful gases in the stomach in the unfortunate case of diarrhoea or severe stomach aches6.
Many people would be surprised that the ubiquitous â€˜atap-chee' in Singapore's beloved dessert â€“ the ice kachang â€“ is the seed of the Nipah, a palm tree that grows only in mangrove forests. The sugary sap from the stalk of the nipah inflorescence (or flower cluster) can also be used to make vinegar and palm sugar (Gula Melaka), while the large fronds can be weaved into anything from baskets to kampong house roofs6.
However, plants are not the only organisms in a mangrove forest with medicinal benefits. Haemocyanin in the blood of the horseshoe crab has been widely used by doctors as a diagnostic tool to detect harmful gram-negative bacteria6.
The mangrove forest is also a rich fishing ground that provides seafood ranging from the cheap to the very expensive (think of local delicacies such as drunken prawns and chilli crabs). Prawns from the family Penaeidae such as the tiger prawn as well as the mud crab (Scylla spp.) are common inhabitants of mangrove forests. They share a common home with other organisms like the flower crab (Portunus pelagicus), the Teochew vinegar crab (Episesarma spp.) and the sea hum or blood cockle (Anadara granosa) which provide humans with a diverse source of food.
The usefulness of mangrove forests does not stop at the organism level. The mangrove forest structure has been found to play an important economic role in aquaculture, sediment accretion, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and removal of toxic chemicals7-13. Collectively, the ecological services provided by mangrove forests can amount to about USD$1.6 billion per annum; and humans get it all for free13.
A team of scientists have found that the biomass of several commercially important species of fish was more than doubled when adult fish habitats in the sea were connected to mangroves10. It is also estimated that 80% of the world's fish catch are directly or indirectly dependent on mangrove habitats as many fishes utilise mangrove swamps as nursery areas for their young7. The dense networks of mangrove roots serve as protected places where fish larvae can seek refuge from predators, giving them a better chance for survival.
The extensive roots of mangrove trees not only serve as a place of refuge for small nekton (swimming organisms) but also enable them to hold sediment and thus, prevent coastal erosion3. These roots also buffer nearby coastal communities from the full force of tidal waves during natural disasters such as tsunamis13, 14.
In lieu of the pressing need to abate global climate change, mangrove forests should not be sidelined for their ability to function as carbon sinks. A study on the carbon sequestering ability of mangrove forests in the Universiti Sains Malaysia has found that 4.5 million hectares of mangroves can absorb the carbon emissions of about five million cars6!
Furthermore, mangrove forests are nature's â€˜detoxification' agents. Mangrove plants, have been reported to sequester toxic chemicals such as water-borne pollutants and heavy metals, and store them in aboveground biomass15, 16. The mangrove tree, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, is not only a pretty sight, but is able to bio-accumulate pyrene, while its â€˜sister' species, Bruguiera sexangula is able to absorb cadmium17. However, mangrove trees of the genus Bruguiera are not the only ones able to clean up the environment. On your next visit to Singapore's mangrove forests, look out for Xylocarpus granatum. This mangrove tree with a â€˜cannon-ball' fruit is also a hyper-accumulator of pollutants including boron, iron, copper, manganese and zinc17.

A Ray of Hope 
Much has been said about the ecological services mangrove forests provide not only to humans but to the ecosystems connected directly and indirectly to it. As such, it would be in our best interest to halt the current continuing loss of Singapore's mangrove forests.
Singapore's mangroves can be preserved and even, encouraged to grow, should successful mangrove restoration schemes be put in place. However, mangrove restoration can be a notoriously challenging project especially if the restoration committee has not been properly trained in mangrove management practices such as mangrove zonation.
Despite the small land area of Singapore's mangroves, the mangrove forest can be roughly divided into different zones with distinct plant species found at different areas in the forest. For example, plants from the Ceriops genus can be found closer to the land while mangrove trees from the genus Rhizophora are more suited for life near the open ocean18. In the past, mangrove restoration projects in various countries made the mistake of planting incorrect mangrove plants in the different zones of the mangrove forest, resulting in much preventable plant death and a loss of capital.
However, there have been shining examples of successful mangrove restoration efforts on Singapore's own shores. Restoration of mangrove forests at Sungei Api Api in Tampines and on Pulau Semakau have resulted in a more robust mangrove ecosystem in these two locations (see â€œTurning the Tides for Singapore's Mangrovesâ€).

To aid in educating future mangrove conservationists on the importance of recognising the species of mangrove plants best suited for life in the different mangrove zones, the National Institute of Education's National Sciences and Science Education Academic Group has produced a Comparative Mangrove Guide Sheet (see fig. 9).
This guide sheet, coupled with continuous mangrove research contributions and educational outreach programmes could help increase the current understanding of Singapore's mangroves in terms of its ecology, biodiversity and conservation needs.
The purpose of education on mangrove biology is however not merely restricted to conservation needs. The recent discovery of two rare mangrove species in Singapore highlights the importance of education in the area of mangrove biodiversity. Without prior knowledge of what kind of plants can be found in Singapore's mangrove forests, these two new species (and many more in the future) might just have gone un-noticed!

Careful morphological and chromosomal analyses revealed that the local Kandelia candel (a small tree called Pisang Pisang) is of a distinct species from other Kandelia species found in East Asia. As such, the plants of these species were renamed Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu & Yong; adding another new species to Singapore's mangrove record. Another cause for celebration would be the discovery of the last two Bruguiera hainesii in June 2003. These two plants were found in Sungei Loyang and Sungei Jelutong (Pulau Ubin) respectively. Although shining a ray of hope into the plight of Singapore's mangrove ecosystem, these findings serve to highlight the vast amount of biodiversity remaining in Singapore's mangrove forest which need our protection. If nothing is done to conserve the little of what remains of Singapore's mangroves, the rich biodiversity and natural heritage within these truly amazing habitats might soon become a thing of the past.

Turning the tide for Singapore's Mangroves
In recent decades, Singapore's remaining mangrove habitats have enjoyed a reprieve of sorts after earlier decades of retreat. This hopeful trend arose as both citizens and the government came to see and appreciate the role of mangrove forests as natural habitats that deliver vital ecological services as well as contribute to education, tourism and enhancing the quality of life and leisure in a largely urban city-state.
One of the earliest results of this drive to find a balance between development and conservation was Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. This wetland of old prawn ponds surrounded by rich mangroves was discovered to be a haven for migratory shorebirds by nature lovers in 1986, and following a proposal to conserve the area, the Parks & Recreation Department (the precursor to the National Parks Board) took over the development and management of the wetlands, which was officially opened by then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on 6 December 1993. Sungei Buloh was later gazetted as a nature reserve in 2001 and was named Singapore's ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003 as a protected area of high conservation value.
A lush mangrove forest is also among the highlights of Chek Jawa Wetlands at the eastern tip of Pulau Ubin. Originally slated for urban development, this coastal wetland was revealed to be a biodiverse mix of habitats for many rare plants and animals following surveys by the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research. Thousands of Singaporeans subsequently visited the shore and this led to calls to preserve Chek Jawa. As the land was not urgently required for development, the Ministry of National Development announced a 10-year deferment of land reclamation at Chek Jawa in January 2002 and the National Parks Board opened in July 2007 the Chek Jawa Wetlands which features a coastal boardwalk, viewing tower and visitor centre in a historic Tudor cottage originally built in 1930s by the Chief Surveyor of Ubin, Langdon Williams.
Meanwhile, residents of Tampines and Pasir Ris get to enjoy mangroves almost at their doorstep, thanks to an initiative by the National Parks Board to preserve a 5 ha patch of mangrove around Sungei Tampines and Sungei Api Api, where a successful mangrove regeneration project began in the early 1990s.

The lessons from this project were later translated to Pulau Semakau in the Southern Islands, where the National Environment Agency operates an offshore land fill that doubles as a nature destination, thanks to an effort to replant two plots of mangroves that had to be removed during the construction of the land ll. Today, Pulau Semakau continues to harbour thriving mangroves and reef flats with abundant bird life and marine creatures.

BeMuse Volume 6 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2013
Art lovers in Singapore were treated in June 2013 to a display of stunning works from one of the oldest privately held European collections. They witnessed first-hand the sheer breadth and scope of the collection, gaining in the process and insight into the fine taste and aesthetic judgement of the patrons â€“ the princes of the House of Liechtenstein. It was hoped that this exhibition would attract art lovers, students, and a wide section of the public including patrons and collectors. As the arts in our times are largely a source of speculative wealth, the Liechtenstein collection is a very rewarding source of inspiration for good taste and vision in acquiring art. The difference between an indifferent patron and a careful one is not just a matter of education, instinct, taste, or even sound judgement â€“ but imagination. Whether the patron is an individual or a collective, public or private, an ideal supporter is willing to step beyond the confines of his or her own historical context and conventions. Such a patron can envision a far-reaching artistic programme that lasts for a few centuries. There have been examples of such bold patrons in both South Asia and East Asia, too. Despite the personal glorification that is an inherent motivating factor of such enterprises, one can only marvel at the results in, for example, the vast temple complexes of India or the intricate decorative sheets of the Mughal Hamza Nama.
Collections of refinement
Prince Johann Adam Andreas I (1657-1712) was one such astonishing patron. At age 27, he became the head of the family and during the next 28 years (r.1662-1712), the Prince expanded the family's wealth and acquisitions. He purchased lands including the present principality of Liechtenstein, properties, embarked on building projects, commissioned artists and acquired works â€“ all of which have given the Princely Collections their richly deserved status and recognition. He was influenced by his father Prince Karl Eusebius (1611- 1684), a dedicated collector who did much to give a definite orientation to the collections. He was also the author of two didactic works, which in English read as â€œTreatise on Architectureâ€ and â€œPrincely Education: Instructions for Life, Lifestyle and Collecting.â€ Prince Johann Adam Andreas was educated in philosophy and also went on a Grand Tour in which he specially studied Italian art. He would use this knowledge and understanding to grow his collections.

The historic context in which Prince Johann Adam Andreas lived and acquired played an important role in shaping his tastes and decisions. After the Turks were expelled from Vienna in 1683, the leading aristocrats including the House of Liechtenstein became the major art patrons and were responsible for turning Vienna by 1700 into a Baroque city, which began to attract numerous artists. During this time many Italian artists sought support from the elites in German-speaking lands, as there was also a decline in papal patronage especially in Rome. Thus, as a leading patron and collector, Prince Johann Adam Andreas played a major role in fostering Baroque art in Europe, particularly Vienna.
The Prince left his mark in the two Baroque palaces that he built in Vienna. One was a City Palace and the other was the Summer or Garden Palace in Rossau, then outside the city. He bought land in 1687 and planned for a large palace with extensive gardens. The Austrian architect Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723) provided the overall concept, which included a country-style residence, a belvedere, and a Baroque garden linking the two. Eventually, two Italian architects, first Domenico Egidio Rossi (1678-1742) and next, Domenico Martinelli (1650-1718), were hired to complete the building.
Johann Bernard Fischer von Erlach (Graz 1656â€“1723 Vienna), The Belvedere in the Gardens of the Liechtenstein, Summer Palace in Rossau Quarter, 1721, Copperplate etching, H52.2xW63cm, old family collection.
The Prince took great interest in the decoration of the rooms and for this, he carefully chose painters, sculptors, and decorators. Towards this end, he maintained a wide network of artists and dealers and corresponded with major cultural centres such as Bologna, Florence, Rome and Venice. For decorating the five rooms in the Garden Palace overlooking the garden, he sought the services of the Bolognese artist Marcantonio Franceschini (1648-1729).

It should be noted that the Garden Palace was the sum total of the Prince's grand vision â€“ a dwelling in which the tastefully decorated interiors were matched by the exteriors with gardens and statuary. The most fascinating documents are the correspondences between the Prince and the artist. It was a patronage that lasted from 1691-1709, in which the Prince commissioned works and sought advice on purchasing of works. The thoroughly documented exchange includes 159 letters (written in Italian) that illustrate the choices of the patron, the artist's preference, details of payment, and mode of transporting the works. Over a history of over 500 years, each Prince has left a distinct imprint of his taste and temperament. Today the Princely Collections represent a showcase of diverse individual choices. As early as 1400, Gerog von Liechtenstein (c.1360-1419) was reputed for his art commissions. The first major patron was the first hereditary prince, Prince Karl I (1569-1627) who was fond of collecting decorative objects. While Prince Karl Eusebius (1611-1684) created the artistic nucleus of the collections, it was, as we have seen, further enriched by his visionary son, Prince Johann Adam Andreas I (1657- 1712). Subsequent princes have nurtured the collections with care by continuing to purchase art works and protecting their inheritance through dangerous times such as war. Today the Princely Collections, although privately held, are a testimony to the rich collective cultural heritage of European thought and patronage.

A showcase of Baroque art
The exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore, consisting of 91 works, was organised in several sections. Opening with a section on the House of Liechtenstein, it introduced the visitors to the royal family, its princes, their various palaces and a range of decorative objects they commissioned and collected. The rest of the display followed a western art-historical trajectory beginning with the Renaissance era. The art of the Baroque, which forms the bulk of the display, was organised along examples from the southern and northern Baroque. Dedicated sections on Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625) and Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) â€“ the latter being the highlight of the exhibition â€“ enrich the display.

Acquired by Prince Alois I in 1787.
Baroque art, a pan-European style spanning 1600 to 1750, is largely an art for the senses. Having emerged in the age of religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants, Baroque art is not uniform but marked by regional and cultural variations â€“ examples of which could have been seen in the exhibition. The most important 17th century Baroque artist, Peter Paul Rubens, was represented with eight works including two drawings or modelli. Rubens's extraordinary gifts can be seen especially in the highly expressive Lamentation (1614/1615), a painting that moves us to tears.

Acquired by Prince Johann Adam Andreas I in 1710.
The distinct themes of stilllife, portrait and genre painting, which received much attention in the hands of the northern Baroque artists are all illustrated through the works of Jan Davidsz. de Heem (1606-1684), Frans Hals (1582-1666) and Adriaen van Ostade (1610-1685).

Acquired by Prince Hans-Adam II in 2006.
The social practice of the Grand Tour, which lasted from late 16th century through the mid-19th century, gave rise to numerous art patrons and collectors and nurtured in them a fine connoisseurship. More importantly it fostered the talents of view painters such as Canaletto (1697-1768) and Giovanni Paolo Pannini (1691-1765). (Also known as vedutisti after the Italian term for view or veduta, view painters created large, highly detailed paintings of cities and other scenic vistas).

Finally the short-lived distinct art of the Biedermeier (1815-c1848) â€“ a realist movement that emerged in the German-speaking regions, is introduced through the work of Ferdinand Georg Waldmuller (1793-1865).

A colonial counterpoint
The Art of Portraiture: Historical Paintings from the National Collection was a complementary exhibition featuring 16 artefacts illustrating diverse representational modes. An integral part of the National Museum of Singapore's historic legacy; many of the works belong to the colonial era. More importantly, several of the paintings reveal their links to the grand British portrait painting tradition, which set the model for representing statesmen, elite personalities and people belonging to a higher social class â€“ an influence that was carried into its colonies and well into the 20th century. Having had an assured patronage from both the royalty and the landed gentry, the fine art of British portraiture was formed largely by continental painters such as Han Holbein the Younger (1497-1543), Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641) and Peter Lely (1618-1680). The compositional modes they set were further expanded and even modified by the premier artist Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), the first President of the Royal Academy of Arts (1768) â€“ the leading arbiter of taste in the 18th century. The American expatriate John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), who settled in London, brought a dashing elegance to his realist depictions. He showed what portraits are really all about â€“ an art of flattery. The oil portraits belonging to the National Museum of Singapore together reveal different artistic persuasions â€“ grandness of vision, idealisation, and a realism. Of particular interest is the range of artists who produced these paintings. They include established artists trained in the Royal Academy, itinerants in colonial Malaya, amateurs and the feted Singapore artist, Lim Yew Kuan (b.1929).
The Principality of Liechtenstein
One of the smallest European states, Liechtenstein is situated between Austria and Switzerland. It is governed by the House of Liechtenstein which is an Austrian dynasty of rulers. They derived their name from Castle Liechtenstein south of Vienna and applied it to their present territory after the estate became an imperial principality in 1719.
The modern history of this dynasty begins with Prince Karl I who became the first hereditary prince in 1608. By the second decade of the 17th century the House of Liechtenstein were closely tied to the Habsburgs. Prince Karl I's grandson, Prince Johann Adam Andreas I purchased the territories of Schellenberg and Vaduz in 1699 and 1712, which were affirmed with the rank of Imperial Principality of Liechtenstein. After Prince Johann Adam Andreas I died without a male heir, the title went to Anton Florian, who was a descendant of Gundaker, Prince of Liechtenstein and this line continues till today. With Prince Franz Joseph II (1906â€“1989) moving to Vaduz in 1938, it became a permanent residence of the ruling princes. Liechtenstein became a constitutional monarchy in 1921 and the town of Vaduz has been the permanent residence of the ruling Princes since 1838.
In 1989, Prince Hans-Adam, who succeeded Prince Franz Joseph II, worked towards making his country a part of the United Nations in 1990. Now it is the 160th and smallest member of the UN. The Principality is the 4th smallest state in Europe and covers a 62-square mile area between Switzerland and Austria. It is highly industrialised, has an export-oriented economy and offers a hospitable atmosphere for business.

Now more than ever, the image of a woman in a sarong kebaya resonates with the Singaporean public â€“ from the iconic Singapore Girl to the Little Nyonya of primetime TV and even to the blown-up images of Ivan Heng as the sultry Emily Gan in Emily of Emerald Hill. The sarong kebaya, a tubular batik skirt worn with a fitted blouse, is still proudly worn by Peranakan women â€“ Nyonyas â€“ in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar. The diverse influences that led to this enduring garment are traced in a new exhibition at the Peranakan Museum.
The early 20th century was the golden age of the Peranakan sarong kebaya, and in recent years the garment has experienced a major revival. Yet perhaps at no other moment has the sarong kebaya been so misunderstood.
One of the most arresting images of Mediacorp's hit television series Little Nyonya, set between the 1930s and the 1950s, was of the protagonist cooking up a feast in the kitchen. Simply but immaculately dressed in a sarong kebaya, she wore her hair neatly pulled up into a chignon. However, during that period, unmarried girls did not wear an expensive and delicate sarong kebaya into the kitchen, and chignons were only sported by their mothers and grandmothers, while they themselves preferred modern short crops, crimps and perms. And most of the batik sarongs shown in the series are of a type popular only in the late 1950s and 1960s. Such anachronisms are common â€“ and have arisen because of the dearth of information on Peranakan fashion. An exhibition at the Peranakan Museum from 1 April 2011 to 26 February 2012 aimed to fill in the gaps.
Sarong Kebaya: Peranakan Fashion and its International Sources presented the historical and stylistic phases of the Peranakan sarong kebaya from the 1800s to 1950s. It revealed fascinating aspects about the origins of both components of the costume over five centuries. On display were 131 objects, including 58 outfits presented in chronological sequence. Many of the cloths and kebayas belonged to types that have never been published before, including rare treasures from the Peranakan Museum, from the collection of Mr and Mrs Lee Kip Lee, and from three Dutch museums: the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam and the Museum Volkenkunde in Leiden.
Distant Origins
The exhibition began with rare textiles from the 16th to 19th centuries that reveal the history of skirt cloths and sarongs. Some of these ancient patterns can still be found on batiks worn today. The ports of maritime Asia had long been dynamic centres of exchanges between cultures. One medium of cultural contact was cloth. By the 16th century, Indian textiles from Gujarat and the Coromandel Coast were extremely popular commodities used by Arab, Indian and European traders to barter for spices from the Malay archipelago. Although sarong is a term used nowadays to describe any kind of wrapped skirt, it is in fact a long cloth sewn into a tube (sarung means â€˜sheath' in Malay). Early examples of wrapped skirts and ceremonial cloths, as well as the earliest documented sarong made from an Indian textile, were among the treasures on display.

Two key types of garments were introduced. The prototypical kebaya is a long loose jacket derived from the ancient qaba, an Islamic robe worn at least since the 9th century by rulers across the Middle East, Central Asia and northern India. By the 17th century it had become a common garment worn by both men and women of the elite classes across the region. Even the Brahmins of Calicut (now Kozhikode in Kerala, India) wore a long white gown called a cabaye, â€˜of very white cotton, reaching to the heels'.1 Variant spellings include cabaia, kabaai and kabay. However, in the 19th century, this robe was called a baju panjang (â€˜long robe' in Malay) in Malacca, and was worn by Peranakan women until the early 20th century. The other key robes was the baju, a hip- or knee-length tunic with a V-shaped opening for the head. This is derived from the bazu, another ancient Islamic garment. In the 17th century it was common all over the Indian Ocean and the Malay archipelago, and worn by men and women, including the women of the first Eurasian communities in the Portuguese colonies of Goa and Malacca, and even in the Spice Islands further east. European travellers noticed that women wore a baju â€œso fine that you may see all their body through itâ€.2 Another traveller noted that the baju worn by noblewomen in the court of Banten in Java were â€œso lightly executed that their embroidery does not hinder one from perceiving their naked bodies.â€3 This tropical engagement with see-through fabric endured till the 20th century.

Early Nyonya â€˜Bajus'
The earliest group of costumes worn by Peranakan women in the exhibition dates to the late 19th century and showed the evolution of Nyonya fashion,starting with the sombre hues of the staid baju panjang and plaid sarong. By the 1910s, women wore bright and transparent European organdies (worn for modesty over a high-necked, long-sleeved white blouse) together with expensive hand-drawn batik sarongs imported from Chinese workshops on the north coast of Java. The Chinese had been involved with batik-making at least since the late 18th century. Production was mostly low quality and by the early 19th century, large quantities of batik handkerchiefs and shoulder cloths were exported to the Straits Settlements. The finest hand-drawn cloths were produced in limited numbers for wealthy patrons in Semarang and Lasem, at the north coast of Java. It was not until the second half of the 19th century that the production of high quality batiks reached quantities large enough for export to Singapore and the region.

By the 1930s, the combined baju panjang and sarong was a riot of colour, especially because the batik sarongs were able to match the vibrant hues of the imported organdies after chemical dyes were introduced from Germany. In Singapore, the organdie was called kasa, after a centuries-old trade term for fine gauzes. The Nyonyas added their own flavour to the term, referring to it as kasa gelair (â€˜glass-like organdie') after its translucent quality.

Lace: Threading East and West
In the 18th century, colonial women in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) added lace to their long kebayas, which they wore with voluminous skirts or saias made of hand-drawn Indian cloths. The word for lace in many languages of the region is derived from the Portuguese term renda, entering even the Peranakan Fujian dialect spoken in Penang, where lace is termed lianla.
By the mid-19th century this fashion was widespread throughout the colonies, and dressing in a white lace kebaya with an expensive cotton batik sarong became a status symbol among European and Eurasian women in the Dutch colony. During this time, European female entrepreneurs in Semarang and Pekalongan in Java began producing high quality batiks to satisfy the huge demand. Taking on many traditional patterns from the old Indian textiles worn by their ancestors a century before, they added many innovative design features to create a whole new genre, today called batik Belanda (â€˜Dutch batik' in Malay). Dutch women's journals advised that a lady living in the colonies required three dozen kebayas and at least a dozen sarongs. There were kebayas specifically for day and night, the latter being less elaborate. On their long sea journeys from the Netherlands to the Indies, women switched from Western dress to sarong kebaya after their ship passed Port Said.4
The sarong kebaya was a costume disparaged by many European travellers. One author described it as an outfit that was â€œthe only practical morning dress, because it can be easily changed two or three times a day â€“ which is becoming to so few; the way the sarong falls straight in the back is particularly angular and ugly, however elegant and expensive the costumeâ€.5
From Emulation to Assertion
Some time around 1900, Nyonya women in the Dutch East Indies began to abandon the long and loose kebaya or baju panjang, and opted instead for the elegant and contoured European white lace kebaya and floral sarong, a fashion they exported to the Straits Settlements. Even at that time, the costume was totally misunderstood. A resident of Kuala Lumpur, in a lively debate on the sarong kebaya organised by the Selangor Chinese Literary and Debating Society in 1904, described the outfit as â€œan imitation borrowed from the Malayâ€. The kebaya was â€œnot graceful, nor neatâ€ and the vulgarity of the sarong was â€œbeyond questionâ€, making the Nyonya â€œa disgrace to modern civilisationâ€.6
Such criticisms were ignored, since for the next fifty years, the sarong kebaya was the hallmark of Nyonyas in the region. On the other hand, the European women they were emulating stopped wearing the sarong kebaya completely, preferring the modern fashions of the Jazz Age. This period might be regarded as the high point of the Peranakan sarong kebaya. Peranakan women soon added elements that expressed their own identity. Kebayas became increasingly elaborate, and the introduction of the Singer sewing machine lifted imitation lace to astounding levels. Fields of meticulous lace-like work, impossible to achieve with real lace, resulted in kebayas that were breathtaking, cross-cultural works of art. In the 1930s, the finest examples were made from pale cotton voiles, complementing the absurdly complex batiks made in Chinese-owned ateliers in small towns on Java's north coast. They produced unique pieces for wealthy clients; the batiks were so precious that retailers kept them in safes until buyers were found.
In January 1930, the British textile manufacturer Tootal trademarked their signature cotton voile known as Robia, and by April of the same year it was advertised for sale in Singapore at Whiteaway, Laidlaw & Co.7 Among Nyonyas, this name became synonymous with the voile used for kebayas, and has deep nostalgic resonance for many Peranakans today.
Towards the middle of the century, the colours of the sarong and kebaya became increasingly vivid and intense. After the war, the prohibitive expense of lace and the desire for stronger hues and dramatic modern patterns resulted in kebayas with larger motifs and sarongs drenched in contrasting colours.
To the wearers, the costume was a very private indulgence. Like many luxuries, the finest aspects of workmanship and quality were expressed in details that were hidden when worn. For much of this golden age, the sarong kebaya was an outfit for the home, important family occasions and visits to the residences of close friends and relatives. When a nyonya had to put on a public face â€“ at colonial events or occasions when there would be people of other communities â€“ she frequently preferred the Chinese cheongsam. However, with over 50 examples on display at the Peranakan Museum, the iconic sarong kebaya were finally nudged back into the limelight.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-early-communities/story,"The Malay community consists of many different sub-groups. Among the first of these groups to arrive were Tengku Hussein Shah's followers.
As Singapore prospered, it also attracted the Baweanese, Javanese and Bugis â€“ ethnic groups from territories belonging to Indonesia today.
The Baweanese hailed from Bawean island while the Javanese, Central and East Java. The earliest Javanese migrants to Singapore were believed to have been craftsmen and merchants. From a small group of 38 in 1825, the Javanese population expanded to 8,541 between 1886 to 1890 when they were recruited en masse to work in plantations and mines in the region.

Baweanese men viewed leaving home to work overseas a necessary rite of passage. They arrived in smaller numbers and later than the Javanese. In the early 1900s, they emigrated to Singapore in droves when the Dutch started imposing a tax based on the number of individuals living on Dutch territories.
The advent of steamships made Singapore a launching pad for the Hajj journey to Mecca. Pilgrims would often work here to fund their pilgrimage.

The Bugis were a seafaring people who originated from Sulawesi. They were one of the first immigrants to arrive in Singapore, being able to trade more freely under the British than in Dutch-controlled territories.
A Day in the Pondok
When Baweanese immigrants arrived in Singapore in the 19th century, they lived in communal shelters called pondok. Life in a Baweanese pondok was peaceful, although never quiet. Its close-knit community came together particularly during Ramadan and Hari Raya.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
During Ramadan, families in the pondok would gather to break their fast, share food, stay up to pray and recite the Quran. At about 3pm, the girls would head to the mosque to collect bubur lambuk â€“ a spiced porridge which was distributed to the public only at this time of year.
A week before Hari Raya, the pondok would be brimming with activity. Boys were called upon to help beat the batter for kueh bahulu and pound the peanuts required to make the peanut sauce for satay and ketupat â€“ diamond-shaped rice cakes wrapped in wove coconut leaves. The Pak Lurah, or headman, would distribute money to each family so they could purchase ingredients to make kueh and cloth to make new bedsheets. Those who were talented at sewing would be tasked to sew new curtains for the pondok.
This money came from the monthly contributions pooled by the pondok's residents. A trustworthy person appointed as bendahari, or treasurer, was in charge of money matters.
Shopkeepers visited the pondok to hawk their wares. An Indian man selling textiles, and a Chinese drinks seller who spoke fluent Baweanese were recalled to be hot favourites among the residents.

Tucked away on a hill, hidden among the high commercial buildings, it is difficult to imagine that a red-roofed, two-storey building holds the blueprints of the Singapore philately story.

The Singapore Philatelic Museum is the humble abode to Singapore's postal history since it opened on August 19, 1995. It is Southeast Asia's first philatelic museum, with main galleries and travelling exhibitions, as well as a quirky museum shop known to be a philatelist's playground. To the first time visitor, the museum readily offers a rich lesson in Singapore's history and heritage with its collection of deceivingly simple stamps.
A Nation's Story in Stamps
Before the advent of technology, mail was the main form of long-distance communication for the maritime port. The East India Company introduced the first postage stamp in Singapore in 1854. The Straits Settlement government took over the issue of stamps between 1867 and 1946.
As the mail volume and demand for postal services in the country increased, the General Post Office was relocated several times. The Fullerton Building, named after Robert Fullerton who was the first governor of the Straits Settlements, was a grand post office established by the side of the Singapore River in 1928. It was the largest building in Singapore when it was first completed.

The initial purpose of stamps was purely functional, used only for everyday postal needs. They were issued regularly at the post office.
In 1917, the Red Cross was the first to use the stamp to solicit funds for war victims, by printing â€œRED CROSS â€” 2câ€ over three- and four-cent stamps. In another example, King George V stamps were issued with the overprint â€œMalaya Borneo Exhibitionâ€ to commemorate an exhibition unveiling the budget plan to develop reclaimed land at Telok Ayer.
During the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese used stamps as a propaganda instrument to establish their sovereignty. The Japanese recalled existing stamps throughout the country and overprinted them to deface the British sovereign head on the stamps. They then redistributed the colonial stamps in Japanese. Unexpectedly, the first public postage stamp design contest was organised during the Japanese Occupation period.
After World War II, postal services resumed under the British Military administration. Due to the mandatory one-month period to overprint stamps, postal services were free of charge (FOC) between September 17 and October 18, 1945. Besides the necessity of the FOC grace period â€” the alternative being cancelling all postage services â€” it was also thought to be a fitting way to celebrate the end of the war.
The first set of Singapore stamps were issued in 1948, making history by featuring the word â€œSingaporeâ€. The event was commemorated with a stamp design with a lion statue as its main feature.
Beginning from the 1960s, stamps were used extensively to commemorate significant political, social and economic events in Singapore's history. In 1960, for Singapore's historical first National Day, the stamp issue featured the new state flag. In 1961, the stamp showed the joining of hands of four individuals from the Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Others (CMIO) ethnicity model. In 1962, skilled labour was depicted to show the turnaround of Singapore's economy by industrialisation; in 1963, blocks of Housing Development Board (HDB) flats were featured. Loosely speaking, the stamp designs were the visual manifestation of Singapore's social, economic, and political ambitions.
Throughout the years, stamps have told different stories, immortalising people, events, buildings and even botany. In this digital age, it can be argued that definitive stamps have reached the end of an era. On the other hand, just like how photographs hold memories, the collection of stamps in the Singapore Philatelic Museum still holds value, serving as a photo book of sorts that narrates the Singapore story.

Today's Singapore Philatelic Museum
The Singapore Philatelic Museum has been active in its mission to acquire and exhibit postage-related artefacts, and to educate the public on philately. The public gets to enjoy the wonders of the 1.3 by 1.8 inch prints, amongst other paraphernalia, in colourful, cosy, and interactive exhibitions.
The stamp galleries are not all exclusively in local flavours. In the recent Return to Sender â€” An Exhibition, the Singapore Philatelic Museum showcased an array of stamps and collectibles related to Elvis Presley. The collection, that includes vinyl records and movie posters, was on loan from a Singapore collector. The exhibition ended on 15 November, 2015.
Every visitor leaves the Singapore Philatelic Museum with a sticker in the shape of a stamp. More importantly, they are taking with them a unique, educational experience. Going past the red postbox (which they can mail a real letter or postcard from) that holds fort at the museum entrance and exit, one can hope that they have discovered a world of priceless legacies in the humble two-storey abode.

G.R. Lambert (b. 1846) from Dresden, Germany, is a name closely associated with the early photographic history of Singapore. He was one of the earliest commercial photographers who had made a name in Singapore and the neighbouring regions, and was amongst the first to establish a permanent photograph studio in Singapore in the 1880s.

The photographic company he set up, G.R. Lambert & Co., had the most extensive inventory of contemporary views of Singapore, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra. Comprising about 3,000 subjects, it was known to be one of the finest collections in the East. G.R. Lambert & Co. also maintained a high reputation for artistic portraiture.
G.R. Lambert & Co.'s works are valuable historical records of the growth and developing topography of Singapore as a British colonial centre. The impressive stock of photographs and postcards produced by G.R. Lambert & Co. is today treasured as archival photographic documents providing a visual reference of what Singapore was like more than a century ago.

CAPTURING IMAGES Of THE COMMUNITY
The first mention of G.R. Lambert & Co. was an advertisement placed in the Singapore Daily Times by Mr Lambert in April 1867 to inform the community of Singapore that he had opened a photographic firm, G.R. Lambert & Co., on No. 1, High Street. But he seemed to have left Singapore, only to return a full decade later, in May 1877, and a similar announcement was placed again in the local press.
From his return until the end of World War I, G.R. Lambert & Co. produced high quantities of large format original photographs (8 x 10 in or 20 x 27.5 cm) featuring landscapes and people of Singapore for sale to the public. These photographs can be easily identified by the company's logo which was dry-stamped on the lower right-hand corner of each photograph.

G.R. Lambert & Co. was also extensively patronised by the British colonial authorities to record political occasions and official visits. The firm was not only famous in Singapore but also in the region. It was also appointed as official photographers to the King of Siam, and also the Sultan of Johore. This appointment was proudly printed on the back of a photograph taken in Singapore in 1894.

At the end of the 19th century, G.R. Lambert & Co. had become by far the largest and most successful photographic studio in Southeast Asia. The company operated from the head office at Gresham House, Battery Road and branch studio in Orchard Road, and had overseas branches in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, and Sumatra.

It is difficult to make any accurate assessment of Mr Lambert's own photographic contribution as his presence in Singapore was sporadic. The firm was managed by Mr Alexander Koch, who had entered the business as an assistant around 1883- 1884. Mr Koch's position as manager was later taken over by Mr H.T. Jensen, who ran the business from around 1908-1910. The company was subsequently managed by a number of managers who were operating more as caretakers. The company closed down in 1918.
FROM PHOTOGRAPHS TO PICTURE POSTCARDS
At the turn of the 20th century, G.R. Lambert & Co. and other professional photographers were challenged by the rise of family photographers and amateur photographic societies. As a result, they quickly diversified their photographic business into the production of postcards and the servicing of amateur needs.

The new century ushered in a profitable postcard craze which reached its greatest height of popularity from 1906 to 1913, a period which collectors refer to as the Golden Age of Picture Postcards.

The large photographic business and the vast catalogue of photographs which G.R. Lambert & Co. produced fuelled the lucrative picture postcard trade. It was said that the company had a turnover of about quarter of a million cards a year.

The outbreak of the war in Europe in 1914 brought a complete halt to the picture postcard collecting craze and effectively brought an end to the Golden Age of Singapore Picture Postcards (1906-1913). G.R. Lambert & Co. ceased operation when the war ended in 1918.
From 2 August 2010 to 2 January 2011, the Singapore Philatelic Museum displayed a collection of photographs and picture postcards by G.R. Lambert & Co donated by Mr Koh Seow Chuan.

â€œ... they are human beings seen in their agony. This is not art, it is not imitation; these are their bones, the remains of their flesh and their clothes mixed with plaster, it is the sadness of death that characterises body and form. I see their wretchedness. I hear their cries as they call to their mothers, and I see them fall and writhe. How many human beings perished in similar or even worse ways! Up to now temples, houses and other objects have been found that have aroused the curiosity of educated people, artists and archaeologists; but now you, my dear Fiorelli, have uncovered human pain, and every man feels it.â€
â€“ Luigi Settembrini (1813-76)
On 24 August 79 CE, Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried the Roman town of Pompeii and its neighbours â€” Herculaneum, Oplontis, Stabiae and Boscoreale â€” in the southern Italian region of Campania with volcanic mud, ash and pumice. All the towns perished within two days and were only rediscovered in the 18th century. In 1863, Luigi Settembrini, a professor of Italian literature at the University of Naples legitimised the success of Giuseppe Fiorelli's discoveries in Pompeii when he commented on the plaster casts of bodies of victims found in Pompeii. Giuseppe Fiorelli (1823-1896), director of the archaeological works in Pompeii from 1860 to 1875 and curator of the National Archaeological Museum in Naples from 1863 to 1875 had invited his friend, Settembrini to view the body casts. Fiorelli made use of his training as a numismatist and applied the method of plaster casting to his archaeological work. Volcanic ash had hardened around the bodies of the victims and the flesh of the bodies had decayed. Cavities were formed and Fiorelli ordered a mixture of water and plaster to be poured into these cavities, revealing not only the shapes of the bodies but also their clothing and facial expressions.
William Dean Howells, (1837-1920) the American consul in Naples then, wrote in 1864 upon seeing four body casts displayed in a temporary museum in Pompeii. He mentioned about the victims â€œwhose shape the settling and hardening ashes took; whose flesh wasted away, and whose bones lay there in the hollow of the matrix till the cunning of this time found them, and, pouring liquid plaster around the skeletons, clothed them with human form again, and drew them forth into the world once more.â€
To this day the body casts of Pompeii still leave a striking impression on visitors, evoking a mixture of compassion and simultaneous morbid curiosity about the way the victims have died and their identities and former lives. Take for example, the famous body cast of the â€˜crouching man'. Discovered at the southern walkway of Pompeii's Large Palaestra, the man had covered his mouth with the edges of his cloak as the toxic fumes and volcanic ash overcame him. His pose is typically rigid due to the high temperatures of the eruption which caused muscle spasms and contractions.

Another extreme example of body contortion can be seen in the body cast of a dog found in the House of Orpheus. Left chained to a post to guard the house while its occupants fled, the dog attempted to save itself by climbing up the lapilli that filled the house from the compluvium1 of the atrium2. As the pumice fall-out deepened, the dog climbed higherâ€” until eventually it ran out of chain and was suffocated. The bronze studs around its neck are all that remains of a leather collar. Its contorted position during its death made it difficult to cast.

It has been gathered from excavation reports that a total of 1,047 victims have been found in Pompeii and a total of 103 casts have been made of them.3 The population of Pompeii has been estimated at 12,000 and if there were only that many victims found in the town itself, it meant that many did manage to escape after all.
The moving evidence of the almost instantaneous deaths of the volcano's victims encapsulated in the body casts are not the only reasons which make Pompeii and the Vesuvian archaeological sites so intriguing and famous. The importance and uniqueness of the sites lie in the fact that they possess wide-ranging evidence of Roman urban life, despite post-eruption disturbances. From the public and domestic architecture which has been uncovered, to wall decorations, mosaics, pottery and metal work, it was possible for archaeologists and historians to piece together a fairly accurate picture of the daily life and culture of Roman society in the 1st century CE.
One could easily visualise the entertainment sports they enjoyed, or the food they ate and the gardens they relaxed in, simply from the amazingly well-preserved archaeological evidence of the sites, in particular, those from Pompeii. While Rome offered a glimpse into the grandeur of imperial life, the remains found at Pompeii and its neighbours reflect the liveliness of the daily lives of ordinary citizens, freedman and slaves living in the provincial towns of the Roman empire.
Amongst the most spectacular and interesting finds which gives us a glimpse into the daily lives of the Pompeians are those related to public entertainment, in particular the gladiatorial gear found in the Quadriporticus 4 of the theatres. Gladiatorial contests were the most popular form of public entertainment. These games were originally linked to funeral rites and staged as a tribute to the deceased. They evolved into gladiatorial contests (munera) that were sponsored by magistrates and political aspirants, in order to win the support of the people.
Gladiators were mostly prisoners of war or those condemned to death. Slaves and forced labourers could also become gladiators and literally fight their way towards freedom. On occasion, free men who were forced by circumstances or who were attracted to fame and fortune signed on to become gladiators. Victorious gladiators could keep the bulk of their earnings and accumulate large sums of money, and win the hearts of many fans. Nevertheless, they led hard lives for they could die at any moment during combat and, if defeated, were at the mercy of the spectators.
There were many types of gladiators, each distinguished by their different combat gear and strategies. This helmet with an angular crest and visor is unique to the murmillo gladiator and is amongst the 15 helmets, 14 shinguards, six shoulder guards, and other bronze gladiatorial parade weapons found in the Quadriporticus of the Theatres. Built between the second and beginning of the 1st century BCE, the Quadriporticus was transformed into the training and housing barracks for gladiators when the earthquake of 62 CE heavily damaged the gladiator barracks in Insula V and put it out of use.

A bronze and silver round shield is also amongst the spectacular finds of the Quadriporticus. It was probably used by a hoplomachus gladiator who also fought with a lance and sword.

If we want to know what the Pompeians ate, it is not difficult to deduce their daily diet from the carbonised remains of food found in Pompeii. Carbonised olives, barley grains, walnuts, peach stones, broad beans, figs and oyster shells have been found in the homes and villas of Pompeii. Hence we know for example that the Pompeians ate a good variety of seafood as Pompeii was after all situated near the sea and fish sauce was also found in abundance in the storage jars used in homes and take-away shops known as thermopolia. Carbonised breads were also found throughout Pompeii in these shops as well as homes and bakeries. Besides actual examples of food found in Pompeii, their depiction in frescoes or wall paintings further suggest the range of food the Pompeians enjoyed.
Our knowledge of Greek and Roman paintings is largely derived from the abundant examples of frescoes that have survived from Pompeii and its neighbouring sites. These fresco paintings reflect the ideals and aspirations of their patrons. In emulating Greek styles, the Romans sought to distinguish themselves as cultivated and refined people. These painted wall decorations further served to extend the small confines or windowless rooms of Roman houses.
They bring one into an imaginary realm beyond the physical confines of an enclosure. Take for example, this sumptuously painted garden fresco painted within three frames. Found in the House of the Golden Bracelet in Pompeii, a rather luxurious villa built over three levels and overlooking the sea on the western slope of Pompeii, this fresco originally covered the entire back wall of a summer dining room. Its painting of a garden created the illusion of a lush garden populated with birds within a dining room. Each panel depicts the scene of a garden framed in niches by a light trellis structure. Two oscillas (decorated roundels) and a mask are depicted as hanging from the centre of each panel. Exotic motifs such as a pair of facing sphinxes also feature in this fresco. Dotted amongst the rich vegetation depicted are various birds in a multitude of poses.

Apart from this beautiful fresco, the house was decorated with many other frescoes on the two lower levels containing the bedrooms (cubicula), dining rooms (triclinia), reception rooms and garden. In its garden were also buried fragments of finer examples of frescoes which were destroyed in the earthquake of 62 CE. These were possibly previously used to decorate the dining rooms or garden.
Apart from wall decorations, sculptural decorations excavated from the gardens and villas of Pompeii gave us an idea to the environment they lived in. Elaborate peristyled gardens (viridaria) were often filled with herms, statues, fountains, garden furniture and even aviaries. With the construction of aqueducts in the 1st century CE, water features such as fountains became common in Pompeian gardens.
Garden sculptures often represented the god of wine Bacchus and his entourage of satyrs and maenads, alluding to the wild side of nature. This bronze statue of a young Bacchus would have stood in the garden of a private home. As the god of wine and enjoyment, the imagery of Bacchus was appropriately found in the garden. The cult of Bacchus was a popular one and just outside of Pompeii was a large temple dedicated to his worship.

Herms such as the one below, featuring a young and old Bacchus, often decorated the gardens of the Romans too. Herms are originally pillars serving a protective function for travellers and found at crossroads during Greek times. They were later adopted into Roman towns serving the same functions but went beyond the crossroads and into the gardens of the Roman people as decoration.

From the time it was discovered since the 18th century till today, Pompeii does not cease to amaze for the plethora of archaeological finds when pieced together, not only coherently tell the story of how the ancient Romans lived but also trace the foundations of modern society. From their political system to trade and commerce to the aqueducts and even forms of public and domestic architecture, the Romans have left behind a rich legacy on which modern society was built.
Although the forms may have changed, the ideals, aspirations and inclinations of human beings have not changed very much over time. In fact in many ways, we are much more alike to the ancients than we realise. The violence of the gladiatorial games for example, have transcended to that of computer games, whilst the aspirations of human beings to surround ourselves with beauty and imagery alluding to another world, have not changed too. Furthermore, Mother Nature still reigns over mankind, not matter how much we think we have conquered her.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 3 â€“ Jan 2017
Port Cities: Multicultural Emporiums of Asia, 1500-1900 was on display at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) from November 4, 2016 to February 19, 2017. Peranakan scholar Peter Lee, together with ACM's former director Dr. Alan Chong, conceptualised this show, the first of its kind to explore the histories of Asian port cities through the perspective of local inhabitants, rather than European colonial ties and trading networks.
Port cities perfectly encapsulate a fundamental human process that has existed since time immemorial â€“ the constant mixing of people, objects and ideas. These cities and the powerful cultural dynamics within and between them reflect how culture is formed, spread and shared. The story of port cities in Asia is the story of multiracial communities and networks. It is also the story of global trade, diverse consumption of objects and the spectrum of responses to them. Supply and demand engendered extensive competition, counterfeits, cheap replicas, as well as innovations and improvisations. New cultural forms emerged. Singapore â€“ an active port in the mid-19th century, as depicted in the panoramic view painted by Percy Carpenter â€“ is a large part of this story.

Oceans and waterways facilitated the movement of people, ideas and goods, while climate and trade winds governed them. By considering three categories of cultural dynamics in Asia â€“ divergence, convergence and integration â€“ and by connecting contact points and the complexity and confusion of multi-directional cultural flows, the exhibition managed to elicit new ways of thinking about history.
In the period leading up to the 17th century, starting up life and trading in a new country took place against enormous odds. Those who succeeded reaped rich rewards and made a tremendous impact on material culture. The production of copies and cheap imitations, and their wide circulation created international styles and fashions. The rare example of a kimono made of Indian chintz is testament to the international circulation of textiles and their adaptation in local contexts. Over time, this creativity and the ever-changing dynamics of port cities facilitated what we understand today as modernity and globalisation, and also the development of popular culture.

New Places, New Lives
The exhibition began with an eclectic array of mannequins depicting 19th century inhabitants of Singapore. The presence of people from different backgrounds, dressed in their own fashions, was common not only in Singapore, but also in the many port cities of Asia. Five intimate stories of transnational communities which illustrate the diversity of port cities were told through the objects on display.
Mobile and enterprising, Chettiars have been trading beyond their homeland of the Chettinad region, in Tamil Nadu, India, for centuries. More than 200 years ago, Chettiars built temples in Saigon. Links were strengthened when Pondicherry (near Chettinad) and Saigon became part of the French colonial empire. The treasuries of Chettiar temples in Saigon were filled with ornate gold jewellery offered to deities as devotional embellishments. A gold prabhavali would have been placed around the image of a deity.

Cornelia van Nijenroode (estimated to have lived around 1629 to 1691) was born in Hirado, Japan, to a Dutch merchant and a geisha. This family portrait was made in Batavia, where she had gone after her father's death. At the time, she was married to the wealthy Dutch merchant Pieter Cnoll. Upon Cnoll's death, she became a very rich widow. Her marriage four years later to Johan Bitter and his subsequent attempts to take over her inheritance led to one of the most famous and acrimonious international court cases of the 17th century. It was fought all the way to The Hague, where she passed away.

Dokutan Shoei is the Japanese name of the Chinese monk Duzhan Xingying (1628 to 1706), from Putian in Fujian province, China. Together with thirty other disciples, he followed his Zen master, Yinyuan Longqi (Ingen Ryu Ì„ ki in Japanese), to the port city of Nagasaki, Japan, in 1654 to serve the Chinese population living there. Seven years later, Master Ingen established the O Ì„ baku sect of Zen Buddhism, centred at Manpuku-ji in Uji, near Tokyo. Dokutan was part of this new sect and he later established a Zen temple, Shosan Horin-ji, in Hamamatsu. In addition to his Zen teachings, he also made paintings, three of which werepart of this exhibition. The practices of the O Ì„ baku sect are closely linked with Pure Land Buddhism and Ming culture. Dokutan himself had a strong inclination towards Pure Land philosophy and also held strong Confucian attachments to his parents and ancestors.

Georg Franz MÃ¼ller (1646 to 1723) grew up in the Alsace region of France and became a soldier of the United Dutch East Indian Company (Vereenigde OostIndische Compagnie, commonly abbreviated as VOC). He arrived in Java in 1670 to serve as a soldier in Batavia and other outposts. He studied the Malay language and kept an illustrated diary of his travels, making portraits of the various people in the region, as well as drawings of exotic flora and fauna. The diary also includes sketches of mermaids. When he returned to Europe, he worked for a Roman Catholic church in St Gallen, Switzerland. He left his diaries and other objects collected on his travels to that church before returning home in 1720.

Hikayat Abdullah is the autobiography of Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir (1797 to 1854). Born in Malacca, he had a strict Muslim upbringing and scholarly education. The book is written in Jawi, and gives vivid accounts of everyday life and politics in Singapore, Malacca and the region. For his literary contributions, Abdullah is often referred to as the â€œfather of modern Malay literature"".

Owning, Collecting, and Commissioning
The convergence of people and goods in port cities was made visible by diverse architecture and imported international goods. The multicultural populations spurred conspicuous consumption, social competition and an increasingly globalised marketplace. Unified tastes and fashions became the norm. Members of various communities residing in a port city often coveted the same luxury objects and imported goods. The material culture of port cities was therefore dominated by the coexistence of a comprehensive array of imported goods from the whole of Asia.
One section of the exhibition was devoted to objects from Batavia, perhaps the most important port city in Asia in the 18th century. International goods circulated widely among its multiracial residents, who sported the latest fashions. The flood of Asian goods into this metropolis was probably unprecedented in history. Jan DaniÃ«l Beijnon's painting of a Eurasian woman from Batavia shows an interior space filled with imported goods from Asia. The silk tablecloth and Chinese wooden folding screen (also referred to as a Coromandel screen, after the name of the Indian port from which these screens were exported) were common luxury goods of Asia.

Mayhem: The Dark Side of Dynamic Encounters
Underlying the extraordinary convergences of people was the brutality of travel and urban life. Piracy was rife, mortality on voyages high and among warring nationalities, the plunder of cargo was justified as legal booty. Commerce was often conducted under mercenary and violent terms, and involved harming competitors, forcing agreements, then ignoring agreed-upon terms of such agreements. Trade and armed force went together hand in hand.
Slavery and human trafficking had great impact on urban society, intensifying the racial diversity of the population. Political and religious leaders put into place extremely ruthless measures to control the population. Japan, for example, underwent a period of isolationism under the sakoku (literally â€œclosed countryâ€) policy from 1633 to 1866. Strict restrictions were put in place on the entry of foreigners and the movement of Japanese people abroad. An official 1808 document from the Hirado archives details foreigners who were detained by Japanese authorities due to their illegal entry into Japan. Regulations on the population, however, did not stop violent upheavals nor the whole range of human vices, including murder, gambling, prostitution and illicit drugs.

Contriving, Combining, and Creating
The concentration of diversity in port cities engendered not only racially hybrid communities, but also a multiplicity of hybrid forms. Adaptations and improvisations were the norm because of the commercial nature of most aspects of cultural output. In environments where migrants far from their motherlands made up a large percentage of the population, the traditional was often transgressed. These modern elements can be traced through the material culture of port cities, in the heterogeneous forms and trends, and in the diversity of objects. A locally produced chair from 18th century Batavia features hybrid forms that are a mix of Dutch and Chinese designs. In addition, Chinese-style lacquer coating indicates that the chair was the work of Chinese craftsmen in Batavia.

Increasingly, itinerant craftsmen of different nationalities offered their services in every port of call and were adept at producing work in a range of styles. Consequently, many categories of objects do not have clear provenance. The complexity, chaos and creativity of port cities reveals that globalisation and multicultural, hybrid environments are not new at all. Rather, they are a persistent and ancient phenomena.
Ultimately, they also raise deep questions about whether anything can or needs to be considered homogenous or pure.
The material culture of mixed-race communities illustrates this hybrid quality through the adaptation of new fashions and styles. Adaptation and use of the sarong kebaya by Peranakan nyonyas, for instance, reveals hybrid influences stretching from Europe and southern Africa through to the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia.

The person in the Portrait of a Man in Barong Tagalog has been identified as Don Paterno Molo y San Agustin, called Paterno Molo (1786 to 1853). This painting represents the earliest known dated portrait of a local painted by a Filipino artist. Paterno Molo belonged to an important Chinese- Filipino merchant family who were suppliers of Chinese goods destined for re-export in the Galleon Trade to New Spain. The family's descendants are still prominent in Filipino society today. Portraits like this are indicative of the emergence of a native middle class, who conscious of their newly attained achievement and status, drove the demand for privately commissioned portraits during the mid-19th century. The barong tagalog is today considered one of the forms of national dress in the Philippines. In this picture, the high collar was inspired by Spanish outfits of the period.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/are-you-game-how-we-used-to-play/story,"TL;DR
How did children of yesteryear keep themselves occupied? They were pretty resourceful and inventive. If they lacked a jump rope, they fashioned one out of rubber bands. Traditional games such as this were often inexpensive and easy to make. Brought to life by creative minds, a plethora of games emerged over time, capturing imaginations and unifying communities across playgrounds and open spaces islandwide. Try out some of these games for yourself!
This write-up was adapted from an educational booklet produced by the Malay Heritage Centre.
Yeh-Yeh (Jump Rope)
While the origins of jump rope are fuzzy â€” some believe it started in Egypt while others trace it back to ancient China1 â€” one thing is for certain: jump rope crosses cultures and has entertained children for millenia. It is as much a staple activity for African American girls in modern times, as it was for children of Medieval Europe who used to jump rope on its streets.2
Jump ropes can be made from a range of materials. The ancient Egyptians were said to have used vines while children in more recent times repurpose items such as clothes lines and twine. In Singapore, children used to string together rubber bands in a game some refer to as yeh-yeh.
Try it yourself:
Two individuals hold a piece of rope on each end. Then they swing it. A third player jumps over it.
As the game progresses, the rope is raised higher and higher until the player can no longer jump over the rope without touching it.
Some versions of the game specify six heights to clear, starting at the ground level, then the ankles, knees, waists, shoulders and ears of the individuals holding the rope.3
The player who clears the rope at its highest point wins.
To add yet another dimension to the activity, two ropes can be put in play and whipped around while a player attempts to slip in between the lines and clear them. Rhythms and chants can also be added to enhance gameplay.
Gasing (spinning top)
The top has fascinated both the young and old for centuries. Archaeological digs across the world have uncovered tops fashioned out of a variety of materials including conch shells, seed pods, ivory and iron.4
Closer to home, the game's popularity has been traced back to the 15th century during the reign of the Melakan Sultanate. Records show that the gasing served as entertainment for rice farmers who played it during lull periods after the end of the harvest season.5
The shape of the gasing was said to have been inspired by the fruit of the berembang tree which tapered off at its tip.6 It tended to do well on hard and sandy surfaces.7 In Singapore, gasing was played across kampongs islandwide.
Try it yourself:
Tops are designed to spin rapidly while balanced on their tips. All it takes is a simple flick of the wrist to set the top in motion. Others might need to be wound up via a string around their axis and then released quickly. The player who can keep his or her top spinning the longest, or strike and stop the trajectory of another top in play, wins.
Tie a string tightly around the top of the gasing.
Throw the gasing and release the string at the same time. Carefully transfer the top onto a wooden panel.
In another version of the game, players have to strike and topple each other's tops. The gasing that survives or spins the longest, wins.
Capteh
With acrobatic hurricane-whirl kicks and mesmerising moves inspired by natural predators such as the snake, tiger and leopard, the Shaolin monks are renowned as impressive martial artists. What few would believe is that generations of them had used the humble shuttlecock â€” or capteh as we know it â€” to sharpen and hone their kung fu skills.8
It might seem like child's play to get the shuttlecock off the ground but mastering special moves and keeping it airborne for as long as possible with one's feet is a whole other ball game. An international federation has evolved the game into a competitive sport since 1999, with players battling it out on a court with a net in the middle to challenge their agility, balance and strength.
The capteh played in our neck of the woods tends to be a more casual activity. Looks-wise, it is hard to miss. It typically comprises rainbow hued feathers attached to a weighted, rubber sole.
Try it yourself:
Launch the capteh into the air with one foot and keep it off the ground for as long as possible using either foot. A point is awarded for every successful kick.
The objective is to keep this going for as long as possible without using one's hands.
It is a numbers game with capteh. The more kicks executed to keep it in the air, the higher the chance of winning. Players can also agree on a winning tally of continuous kicks to sieve out the winner.
Capteh can also be a team sport. In this iteration, participants form a circle. The first player then steps into its centre to demonstrate his capteh abilities. A second player takes over and so forth until all players have completed their turn. The team with the most number of kicks wins.
Batu Seremban (five stones)
Soft little pads of beans, rice or sand wrapped in cloth. Some handsewn, some mass manufactured. The game of batu seremban or five stones, where the objective is to catch counters thrown into the air, has enthralled children for generations.
The game, which requires hand-eye coordination and a certain level of dexterity to clear its various levels, is not unique to the region. Researchers have found evidence of it being played in ancient Greece and Ukraine.11
Try it yourself:
Throw the five stones on the ground. Then pick one up to toss in the air.
With the same hand, pick up a second stone from the ground and catch the first stone before it touches the ground.
Now, with two stones in hand, toss one of the stones into the air and pick up a third stone from the ground.
Next, throw one of the three stones in hand into the air, pick up a fourth stone from the ground and retrieve the falling, airborne stone.
Finally, throw the fourth stone into the air and pick up the final stone on the ground.
There are multiple levels to the game, each with increasing complexity and variants of gameplay that involve multiple players. Many Singaporeans would have fond memories of casual or competitive sessions of five stones during their days as students.
Goli
Goli or marbles is a riveting game. At stake are your own marbles which you bring to the arena. Using one's own set of glass balls, players gingerly flick, nudge and prod competitor's marbles away from pre-determined margins â€” usually a circle drawn in the sand or demarcated by string.
The game requires patience, skill and accuracy to control the trajectory of the marbles and successfully strike a competitor's token out of the play zone.
Try it yourself:
Draw a circle on the ground. Thereafter, get each player to place one of their marbles in the play zone.
To start the game, add two parallel lines to the ground. Players should then take turns to each throw a marble from behind one of the lines (A).
The player whose marble is nearest to the line on the other end (i.e. line B), gets to start the game.
Game play starts from line B. Each player takes turns to throw their marbles into the circle with the aim of dislodging those belonging to their competitors.
The player gets to keep the marble he or she successfully edges out of the circle. The participant who collects the most marbles wins.
Congkak
Congkak, a two-player game akin to chess, requires a fair bit of mental agility and mathematical prowess to anticipate moves and game play patterns. The game's objective is to amass the larger number of seeds in your own stipulated storehouse on the board.
The board itself, typically boat-shaped with 16 hollowed out pits, deserves a mention. Early editions used to be hand carved12 and made out of expensive woods such as mahogany or teak. More exquisite sets would feature intricate carvings of dragons or mythical birds. Cowrie shells, marbles as well as saga or tamarind seeds can be used to plug the board's holes.
Variations of the game, which is said to have originated in the Middle East, in particular Jordan between 7,000 BC and 5,000 BC, are played all over the globe, having been spread by travellers and traders over time.13
How it's played:
Two players sit across each other with the boat-shaped block in between.
Each player â€œownsâ€ the circular holes before them (henceforth known as homes), as well as the larger pit on his or her left.
Before the game begins, each house must be filled with seven marbles. Both storehouses are left empty.
Both players then pick up marbles from any of their own houses. Going clockwise, they deposit a marble per house on the board, regardless of who owns the house, until the marbles in hand run out.
They must also deposit a marble at their own storehouses but not at their opponent's before ending the round.
Upon ending the round, a player scoops up all the seeds in the house he dropped his last seed in, and repeats the process until his last seed lands in an empty house.
There are three outcomes for each player at the end of these rounds:
- If the last seed falls into his own house, he can pick all the seeds from his opponent's house lying across it and deposit them in his own storehouse.
- If it drops into his storehouse, he can continue the game, picking a house of his choice from his side to begin the next round.
- Should his last seed end up in an empty house, he is considered â€deadâ€ and his turn ends.
The one with the most seeds at the end wins. This round is followed by two others which vary in play.

Gifts are an integral part of human interaction. Throughout recorded time, gifts have been given and exchanged in varied situations and transactions. At the highest level of societal interaction, official gifts or State gifts comprise a unique category of gifts. They are symbolic artefacts and the presentation and exchange of gifts among the parties involved in the process shapes the nature of relationships that develop between them. In this exhibition presented by the National Museum of Singapore from 22 September 2010 to 9 January 2011, a selection of 50 State Gifts from the collection of the President's Office at the Istana were being displayed for public viewing for the first time in the museum.
The State Gifts exhibited covered the period from 1962 to 2009 and encompassed the terms of office of the six Presidents of Singapore since independence. The Presidents in their capacity as Head of State received these gifts from foreign leaders or their representatives from countries with which Singapore had diplomatic ties. The gifts were formally presented on occasions such as official State visits or courtesy calls made by foreign dignitaries on the Singapore President or during the President's state visits to foreign countries. These gifts now in the collection of the President's Office have, over time, become a symbolic legacy of the diplomatic contacts established between the Singapore Presidency and its foreign counterparts.
The Singapore Presidency
The Singapore Presidency came into existence as a symbolic and ceremonial institution following Singapore's independence in 1965. In the early years of independence, the President became a national symbol both locally as well as in the international arena. At the national level, he symbolised the form and ceremony of constitutional government in Singapore as seen in his formal opening of Parliament and delivery of the Opening Address. In the international arena, he became a symbolic manifestation of the new nation's identity and values in his interaction with representatives of sovereign nations.
A significant development in the evolution of the Singapore Presidency took place in 1991 when Parliament passed a Constitutional amendment to create an Elected Presidency with custodial powers. Since then, the President has been elected by citizens to a six-year term of office and given veto power over the national reserves and key appointments in the civil service.
Over the years, the Singapore Presidency has grown from a largely ceremonial role to one with an element of independence by virtue of veto powers as defined in the Constitution and vested in the President. In retrospect, the Singapore Presidency has also been shaped by the personal character and stature of its respective incumbents. This can be seen, for example, in the public usage of the term â€œthe people's Presidentâ€ to highlight the close symbolic link that has emerged between the Presidency and the citizenry.
The President â€“ An Overview
Encik Yusof Ishak (1910 to 1970)
Encik Yusof bin Ishak was the first President and served from 9 August 1965 to 23 November 1970. Born in Perak on 12 August 1910 and of Minangkabau descent, he was educated in the former Victoria Bridge School and Raffles Institution in Singapore, and then went into journalism. He rose to become the first Managing Director of the newspaper Utusan Melayu in 1939. After World War 2, he continued in journalism until 1959, when he entered public office.
When Singapore attained self-government on 3 December 1959, Encik Yusof Ishak became the first Malayan-born Yang di Pertuan Negara. After Singapore's separation from Malaysia in 1965, he became President of the newly independent country. In this respect, his role reflected the transitional stages by which Singapore evolved into an independent nation.
As President, Encik Yusof Ishak was determined not to play a wholly ceremonial role and toured many constituencies in order to have direct contact with the people. He also emphasised the new nation's multicultural identity in the aftermath of the failed merger with Malaysia. On the regional and international level, he regarded his role as one that could showcase Singapore's determination to succeed as an independent nation. He died in office on 23 November 1970.

The oldest artefact on display, this silver and wood punch bowl is a gift by His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia to the late Encik Yusof Bin Ishak in 1962.
Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares (1907 to 1981)
Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares was the second President and served from 2 January 1971 to 12 May 1981. He was born in Singapore on 12 August 1907 and was educated at, among other schools, Raffles Institution and the King Edward VII College of Medicine. He began a career in obstetrics and gynaecology, and rose to become Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Malaya in Singapore in 1950. After retiring, he went into private practice, having built up an international reputation in his field. It was during this period that he was appointed as President.
Less than a fortnight after assuming his new role, Dr Sheares was thrust into receiving the Heads of Commonwealth delegations arriving in Singapore for the first-ever Commonwealth Conference held in Singapore. He went on to serve two terms of office. Those who knew him noted his readiness to read and ponder over a range of topical subjects when preparing himself for meetings and discussions with foreign dignitaries. He died on 12 May 1981, during the tenth year of his presidency.
Silver Tea Set
The late Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares was presented this silver tea set by the late Tun Abdul Razak Bin Hussein Al-Haj, Malaysia's second Prime Minister.
Mr C V Devan Nair (1923 to 2005)
Mr C V Devan Nair was the third President and served from 24 October 1981 to 28 March 1985. He was born in Malacca on 5 August 1923 and was educated at Rangoon Road Primary School and Victoria School in Singapore. He became a teacher, and in 1949, the General Secretary of the Singapore Teachers' Union. Although he was detained for extended periods by the British colonial authorities due to his anti-colonial activities, he continued to be a prominent trade union leader. He became the first Secretary-General of the National Trade Union Congress and later, its President in 1979. Mr Nair was elected as Member of Parliament for Anson in a by-election in 1979. He resigned in 1981 to become President. He resigned from the Presidency in 1985 due to health reasons. He died on 7 December 2005.

Dr Wee Kim Wee (1915 to 2005)
Dr. Wee Kim Wee was the fourth President and served from 2 September 1985 to 1 September 1993. He was born in Singapore on 4 November 1915 and was educated at Pearl's Hill School and Raffles Institution, which he left in 1930 to join the Straits Times as a clerk. In 1941 he went on to join the United Press Association (UPA) until the Japanese invasion. At the end of the Japanese Occupation in 1945, he rejoined the UPA. In 1959, he joined the Straits Times as Deputy Editor (Singapore) heading the editorial department.
When Dr Wee was nearing retirement, he was appointed Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia in 1973 and subsequently served as Singapore's Ambassador to Japan and Korea. He had a range of experience in public service as well as in community work by the time he became President in 1985. He was in office in 1991 when the constitutional amendments for an Elected Presidency came into effect, hence becoming the first incumbent to hold the new constitutionally-vested veto powers. He died on 2 May 2005.
MR Ong Teng Cheong (1936 to 2002)
Mr Ong Teng Cheong was the fifth President and served from 2 September 1993 to 1 September 1999. He was born in Singapore on 22 January 1936 and was educated in Chong Cheng Primary School, the Chinese High School and at the University of Adelaide. He also obtained a post-graduate degree of Master of Civic Design (Town Planning) from the University of Liverpool in 1967. Following this, he joined the Planning Department of the Ministry of National Development.
In September 1971, Mr Ong resigned from the civil service to set up his own practice. His community work led to a political career. In 1972, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Kim Keat constituency, a position he retained for 20 years. In 1975, he was appointed to his first political office as Senior Minister of State for Communications, culminating in 1985 with his appointment as Second Deputy Prime Minister. Between November 1990 and August 1993, he was Deputy Prime Minister. He resigned from his government positions in August 1993 to stand for the Presidential Elections and was sworn in as Singapore's first Elected President on 1 September 1993. He passed away on 8 February 2002.

Mr S R Nathan
Mr S R Nathan was the sixth President beginning his service from 1 September 1999 to 31 August 2011. He was born in Singapore on 3 July 1924 and was educated at, among other schools, Victoria School and the University of Malaya in Singapore, where he graduated with a Diploma in Social Studies (Distinction) in 1954. He joined the civil service the following year, beginning as a medical social worker and, over a long career, rose to various leading positions, retiring as Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was made Executive Chairman of the Straits Times Press (1975) Ltd in 1982 and also held directorships in several companies.
In 1988, Mr Nathan was appointed Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia, and in 1990, Singapore's Ambassador to the United States, where he served until 1996. Upon his return to Singapore, he was made Ambassador-at-Large and concurrently Director of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University. He resigned from these positions to stand for the Presidential Elections and was sworn in as President on 1 September 1999 for a six-year term. He was re-elected for a second term on 1 September 2005, and passed away on 22 August 2016.

State Gifts and Diplomacy
In the first decades of the twentieth century, a French sociologist by the name of Marcel Mauss (1872-1950) wrote The Gift which became a classic work and is still in print. This work has profoundly helped to shape our understanding of the nature and function of gifts. Mauss based his observations on a study of pre-colonial Polynesian as well as Pacific/North American tribes.
According to Mauss, the process of gift-giving in these societies carried with it a mutually binding obligation to receive and to reciprocate. Gift-giving facilitated a circulation of desired commodities as well as symbolic capital in its various forms to flow among the participating tribes, thus linking them closely together. In other words, the gift contributed to human solidarity and this formed the basis of Mauss' social theory of the gift.
Extending this conceptual understanding of the gift to the realm of the State, we find that the presentation and exchange of State gifts was a long-established tradition among sovereign kingdoms and countries. For example, Egyptian pharaohs presented gifts to their neighbours, the Hittite rulers, who were linked to them by peace and defence pacts as well as by dynastic marriages.
Although the presentation of State Gifts often took place in a situation of normative mutual equality among the involved parties, this was not always the case in the past. For example, the Imperial Chinese court regarded foreign ambassadorial missions bearing official gifts as â€œtribute missionsâ€, implying a submissive allegiance on the part of the foreign countries. Another example of a sovereign-vassal context of gift-giving was the Siamese court receiving gifts of the bunga emas (golden flowers) from the kingdoms of Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu on the Malay Peninsula in the 18th-19th centuries.
However, in the contemporary world of international relations, the presentation and exchange of official gifts is shaped by norms of cultivating mutually beneficial diplomatic ties and friendships among sovereign nations.
Criteria for State Gift
State gifts are viewed as unique by the parties presenting or exchanging such gifts. The exchange is regarded as affirming a mutual relationship that symbolically links the giver and the recipient.
State gifts are also associated with a certain prestige and status reflecting the position of the giver as well as of the recipient. The prestige of such gifts is determined by the ascribed, intrinsic value of the gift in the society or country of the giver, such as its conspicuousness and its rarity, or the type of material such as gold, silver, diamonds and precious stones. Other factors that contribute to the value of the gift include its cultural, artistic motifs and symbols grounded in the history and heritage of the country, and its ceremonial significance. These factors help to position the gift as an appropriate object to be presented at the highest levels of state authority.
The official gifts that are displayed in the exhibition illustrate this range of criteria. As official gifts are representational objects and thus multifaceted, these criteria should be viewed in terms of a holistic combination contributing to the significance of the gift. Some examples include:
Gold and Silver Nielloware Cigarette Box â€“ Thailand
This gift was presented by His Majesty King Bhumibol and Her Majesty Queen Sirikit to President Nathan, 17 January 2005. President Nathan was on a state visit to Thailand from 17-21 January 2005 at the invitation of the King of Thailand. This was the first state visit to Thailand by a Singapore President.
Nielloware is a prominent and unique decorative object in the history of Thai traditional crafts. Niello is a metal alloy comprising sulphides of silver, copper and lead that is applied as a decorative inlay and results in colours ranging from blue-grey to rich black. The alloy is applied after the object is crafted with silver and gold, and with designs and images on the base metal. Nielloware was associated with power and authority. As such, it became a tradition for Thai monarchs to present nielloware objects as gifts to foreign dignitaries.
Marble Octagonal Box â€“ India
This gift was presented by President Dr Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam to President Nathan, 1 February 2006. President Abdul Kalam called on President Nathan at the Istana during his state visit to Singapore from 1-2 February 2006. As part of the visit, President Kalam delivered the 27th Singapore Lecture, â€œEvolution of Enlightened Societies on our Planetâ€, on 1 February 2006.
Indian marble inlay work was prominent during the Mughal period and continues till today. A brass plate with oral or geometric designs would be placed over the marble and the pattern drawn onto it, after which the marble was carved accordingly. Inlay work consisted of inserting polished semi- precious and precious stones into the marble, and further polishing the surface and edges of the marble.
Octagonal Silverware â€“ Brunei
This gift was presented by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah to President Nathan on 27 February 2003. The Sultan and Her Majesty The Raja Isteri called on President Nathan at the Istana during the Sultan's second state visit to Singapore from 27 February to 1 March 2003.
This receptacle, known as a calapa, is made of silver and crafted with attractive designs and motifs. The main body of this octagonal calapa normally contains several small receptacles which are used to keep betel leaf, areca nuts, gambier and lime and kalakati (areca nut cutter). The calapa is used in important and special occasions such as weddings, coming of age ceremonies and other festivities.
Tombac Bowl â€“ Turkey
This gift was presented by President Dr Abdullah Gul to President Nathan, 8 June 2009. President Nathan made a state visit to Turkey from 8 to 14 June 2009.
The term tombac refers to articles made of copper or a copper alloy plated with a gold-mercury mixture. It is an enduring method of copper plating where the gold dissolved in mercury penetrates the pores of the copper utensil. It is still practised in its traditional form in Turkey.
Arabian Dagger â€“ Bahrain
This gift was presented by Crown Prince HRH Shaik Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa to President Nathan on 27 March 2000.
The Crown Prince called on President Nathan at the Istana on 27 March 2000 during his official visit to Singapore from 27- 28 March 2000. This was the Crown Prince's first official visit to Singapore. The gold-layered khanjar (curved dagger) with a steel blade is a ceremonial ornament that is part of male attire at weddings, formal dinners or important civic events.
Silver Dagger â€“ Jordan
This gift was presented by King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein to President Nathan on 3 March 2006. His Majesty King Abdullah II called on President Nathan at the Istana during his working visit to Singapore on 3 March 2006.
The silver khanjar (curved dagger) with steel blade is a ceremonial ornament that is part of male attire at weddings, formal dinners or important civic events.
Conclusion
State gifts are different from other types of gifts as they are presented in the international arena at the highest level of state authority and so help to facilitate a measure of international diplomacy and relations among sovereign countries. As stylistic works of craftsmanship and meaning, they are invested with an â€œemotional geographyâ€ that can help contribute to cross-cultural appreciation. State Gifts are meant to be enduring symbols in the sense that over the passage of time, they serve as a collective reminder of a nation's legacy of interaction and cultivation of ties with the international community.

Notes",Roots Website,Presidential Presents State Gifts From 1962 2009
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/powerhouse-by-the-port-st-james-power-station/story,"BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 1 â€“ Jan to Mar 2011
A Category A winner in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Architectural Heritage Awards (AHA) 2010, St James Power Station represents a radical example of adaptive reuse, from a coal-fired power plant to one of Singapore's top entertainment centres by the harbourfront.
Located just off the Sentosa Gateway off Telok Blangah Road, St James Power Station was opened in 1927 to supply electricity to nearby shipyards, factories and residences. Until 1962, the facility powered much of Keppel Harbour. In 1982, the building was converted into Southeast Asia's first fully automated commercial warehouse. A new lease of life came in 1998 when the URA revealed a Master Plan to transform the HarbourFront Precinct into a commercial and lifestyle hub. For the former power station, this entailed its conversion into a multi-concept entertainment centre housing themed pubs, interactive museums, galleries and other retail or leisure outlets. The building was then refurbished in 2005 at a cost of $40 million.
Steel Standing Strong
DCA Architects, who were tasked to restore and adapt the facility, found a distinctive colonial building that was an engineering feat of its time. The main structure consists of two blocks with 18 metre high steel columns supporting 20-35 metre wide roof trusses. The perimeter steel columns are encased in the brick walls that form the building facades, giving the place a stately masonry appearance.
Architecturally, the power station reflects its colonial heritage with classical motifs adorning its facades. The sturdy appearance of the building is achieved with a solid fair-faced brick base that elevates the repetitive vertical fenestrations, which are proportionately divided by masonry lintels with arches at the top. The building is capped by a simplified masonry entablature which hides the pitched roof to give the structure a civic appearance.
All the masonry surfaces are painted in white to create contrast with the fair-faced brick walls and express the neoclassical architecture of its era. The prominent chimneys are strong reminders of its past as a power station while the light green and blue glass window panels add interest and subtle colour to the building facades.
The slab condition in the two main building blocks was generally satisfactory, requiring no hacking or reconstruction. The structural system from the second to the fourth storey consists of concrete slabs supported on encased steel beams, which required rectification of spalling concrete and rusted steel beams. The steel roof trusses were, however, in good condition.
There is also a 4-storey ancillary block where concrete had spalled and constant water seepage had corroded existing steel beams. To rectify this, new structural columns were constructed and positioned as closely as possible to where the original beams were to retain the spatial quality of the building's interior.
Designed To Connect
Spatially, the voluminous space within the two main building blocks provided an opportunity to evoke a theatrical quality through the use of elaborate props or displays, while the ancillary building was thought suitable for retail or administrative purposes. New mezzanine floors were introduced as viewing galleries for visitors to enjoy the spatial quality within the building. Additional staircases were also built to connect the building blocks internally and to comply with the necessary fire safety codes. To link all three building blocks, new covered walkways and entrance drop-off canopies were provided that also connect to an overhead bridge to the adjacent VivoCity complex.
A special cleaning paste was used to restore the existing fair-faced brick facades to their original state. Other restoration work included protective treatment to the disintegrated brickworks, re-pointing works to the mortar joints, and applying strengthening solution and water-repellent material onto the entire fair-faced brick facades.
The existing coloured-glass window panels had to be replaced as they could not be conserved except for one that was restored to serve as a record of the original construction. The replacement glass panels were sourced from Thailand and selected to match the original panels in colour intensity and texture.
A poignant reminder of the buildings' past function, the existing chimneys were restored and their imposing presence has now become a landmark in the HarbourFront Precinct. Special cleaning agents and protective treatments were also applied to the internal and external surfaces of both chimneys.
St James Power Station has been faithfully preserved according to the principles of maximum retention, sensitive restoration and careful repair to bring the building to its former glory. In its previous role as a power station, it was admired from afar but accessible only to authorised personnel. Today, it is a good example of how adaptive reuse has successfully preserved the distinctive character of a bygone era and made a building relevant by allowing the public to explore its cavernous interior while viewing reminders of its robust past.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/singapores-first-financiers/story,"The Chettiars are a subgroup of the Tamil community who originated from Chettinad in Tamil Nadu, India. Traditionally, the Chettiars were involved in the trade of precious stones, but later became private bankers and moneylenders, establishing their presence in Singapore as early as the 1820s.
Singapore's first Chettiars were men who hailed from Chettinad, Tamil Nadu, to seek their fortunes. They were distinctively recognisable: usually shirtless, dressed simply in white dhotis and sporting vibuthi-smeared foreheads.
A Chettiar moneylender, c. 1890.
Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
The Chettiars adopted the concept of SOHOs (small office home office) long before the term was invented. When they arrived in Singapore in 1824, their kittangi â€“ meaning â€œwarehouseâ€ in Tamil, served as both bank and bunk. By day, these financiers would be hunched over their desks, armed with their ledger. By night, they would push aside the furniture and roll out a mattress for lying down.
Mostly located in Market Street, in the city's financial centre, the kittangi were shophouses from where the Chettiars ran their money-lending and banking businesses. Conversant in Tamil and Malay, they put their clientele of sundry merchants at ease.
Each Chettiar's office was sparsely furnished and not partitioned. Their space was only a few square feet, simply marked by the presence of a low wooden desk, a cupboard and a safe. A cook provided meals and a caretaker looked after the kittangi.
During its heyday, Market Street had seven kittangis which housed some 300 to 400 Chettiar firms. As recently as the 1970s, when the Chettiars started to lose ground to homegrown banks, Market Street still had six kittangis as well as 30 to 40 Indian-owned businesses.
This was one of modern Singapore's first Indian settlements, and the entire quarter vanished in 1977 when the area was redeveloped into the Golden Shoe Complex.

Indian Migrants
Did you know that some of the very first professions taken on by early Indian immigrants were security enforcement? The first Indians to set foot in Singapore were soldiers from Bengal, and the police constabulary was dominated by Tamils and Sikhs for decades.
Sir Stamford Raffles and Major William Farquhar brought 120 sepoys from the Bengal Native Infantry when they landed in January 1819. These sepoys, or soldiers, were recruited from Bengal, Punjab and other northwestern regions in India, and formed Singapore's first defence force under the British administration.
Narayana Pillay, a government clerk from Penang, was Singapore's first Tamil settler on record. He arrived in May 1819. Many more Indians followed. Those who were educated became teachers, lawyers, interpreters and administrators. Many, like the Chettiars, were traders and merchants.
But most Tamils who arrived in the 19th century were low-waged coolies from the untouchable caste. They worked on docks and railways. They came illegally, or by way of the kangani system, in which an employer paid his Tamil foreman to recruit labourers from his home district.
When Singapore became a convict station in 1825, Indian convicts were sent here to construct roads, buildings and canals. They built St. Andrew's Cathedral, the Istana, Cavenagh Bridge, and North and South Bridge Roads. By the 1860s, the Indian community numbered 13,000 â€“ the second-largest in size after the Chinese. The system of convict labour in Singapore ended in 1873 and some pardoned convicts decided to settle in Singapore.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 â€“ Apr to Jun 2016
Every morning, 64-year-old (at the time of writing) Mr Quek Kim Kiang checks the tools of his trade, a pair of hooked poles, before he heads out to the mangroves. There he wades into knee-deep waters to catch mud crabs by hooking them out of their mud holes. He is careful to make sure that the crabs are not injured or broken in the process. If the crab caught is a juvenile, it goes back to the mangroves.
Ahmad Kassim, 80 years old at the time of writing, lives away from the mangroves. His home is a large wooden house that his father built during World War II. He has added a shop to his home and sells drinks to visitors. Recalling life in the village, he says, â€œIn the past, we villagers practised gotong royong. We worked together. Neighbours came together to help each other.â€ Ahmad does not speak English but he understands the language of a thirsty person. The drinks he sells are not overpriced.
These men are part of a small community of residents who live on Pulau Ubin, Singapore's kampong (â€œvillageâ€ in Malay) island off the northeast coast of Singapore.
The story of Pulau Ubin is intimately tied to Singapore in the way of a metropolis and its frontier. The British claimed Pulau Ubin (then spelled Pulo Obin) on August 4, 1825 when John Crawfurd led an expedition to the island from Singapore, which the British had colonised only six years earlier. Crawfurd hoisted the Union Jack on the island and with a 21-gun salute, claimed Pulau Ubin and the small community of woodcutters there as part of the British Empire. Pulau Ubin was later described as an important island that commanded the entrance of the â€œhighway for all vessels trading to China and the Far Eastâ€.
In an effort to combat piracy on the Johor Straits in the early 1850s, the colonial administration encouraged Malay settlers to colonise the island with tax-free land incentives to prevent pirates from using the island as a hideout. Another wave of Malay settlers came in the 1880s from the Kallang River in Singapore to settle around the coastal kampongs such as Noordin, Mamam and Petai. These settlers became fishermen.
By 1847, Pulau Ubin was settled by the Chinese who started private quarrying companies on the island to quarry granite and feed the demand for stone as the colony of Singapore expanded. Later in the 1850s, the colonial administration established large-scale granite quarrying operations on Pulau Ubin for the construction of the Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca, the Raffes Lighthouse, the Causeway, Pearl's Hill Reservoir, Fort Canning and its reservoir, and the Singapore Harbour.
At the turn of the 20th century, large tracts of land on the island were cleared for cash crop cultivation. Coffee, nutmeg, pineapple, coconut, tobacco and rubber plantations were opened up on the island but only rubber remained profitable. Together with granite quarrying, these became the pillars of the island's economy. Not all the people in Ubin were involved in granite quarrying or rubber cultivation. Coffee shops and provision shops were opened across the island to cater to the needs of the quarry and plantation workers. Boat operators started ferry services to connect parts of the island together as the mangrove swamps were impassable on foot. This was an important service as the Tua Peh Kong temple, the focus of religious life on Pulau Ubin, was located at the main town on the island. It was only after the introduction of prawn farms to Pulau Ubin in the 1950s that many of the swamps were drained, linking up the different parts of Ubin and making most of the island accessible by foot.

The 1950s also marked important milestones in Pulau Ubin's history. The first educational institution, Bin Kiang School, was established in 1952 to provide education to the island's children, and a maternity and child health clinic was set up in 1957. Both reflected the increasing needs of the island's growing community.

Population growth on Pulau Ubin reflected the island's economic development. In the 1970s, Pulau Ubin had a population of 2,000 to 4,000 people as granite quarrying reached its peak, due largely to the formation of the Housing & Development Board in 1960 that started large-scale housing development projects across Singapore. By the 1980s, granite quarrying operations were starting to fold up due to the drop in demand for local granite. Rubber cultivation on Pulau Ubin also declined in the 1980s as the soil was exhausted and plantations were no longer profitable to run. The loss of these economic pillars saw many people leaving the island. The population fell to 1,000 people in the late 1980s and by the mid-1990s, the population of Pulau Ubin was approximately 400. By 2001, the population fell to below 200 and it has remained that way ever since.
Pulau Ubin's population decline and loss of economic significance should not be taken as a sign of failure. The island continues to play an important role at Singapore's frontier. The former quarry sites have been reclaimed by nature and transformed into large lakes. The jungle and mangroves have grown into the abandoned plantations creating secondary forests and enabling wildlife to return to the island. The island is now colonised by species of bats, herons, hornbills and crabs that are no longer found in Singapore.

Thousands of people travel to Pulau Ubin every year, not as workers or commuting residents, but visitors who wish to experience the island's natural and cultural heritage. They come to experience the rustic way of life â€“ the kampong life â€“ that can no longer be found anywhere in the metropolis. For example, the annual Tua Peh Kong festival celebrated on the island is a six-day festival featuring processions, opera performances, lion dances, mediumship and getai (live stage performances more popularly associated with the Hungry Ghost Festival). Such a long duration of celebrations is no longer practiced in Singapore. While vestiges of Pulau Ubin's tangible past âˆ’ the former maternity and child health clinic, the Tua Peh Kong temple, abandoned fish farms and quarries, and kampong houses reminds us of Ubin's history, the stories of local residents like Mr Quek and Mr Ahmad continue the story of Pulau Ubin as the living kampong on Singapore's frontier.

Mr Quek Kim Kiang settled in Pulau Ubin sometime in the late 1980s when the population on the island was in decline. Unlike other residents on Pulau Ubin, Mr Quek alternates between living in a house on the island and on a fishing platform anchored just off the southern coast. The fishing platform is a reminder of his past as a fisherman. These days he catches more crabs than fishes. He uses traps and hooked metal poles to catch freshwater mud crabs on the island's mangrove swamps.

Mr Quek is keenly aware of the impact of human activities on Ubin's ecosystem. He recalled an incident when he encountered someone who caught a small-sized crab and he confronted him. The person responded: â€œIf I don't catch it, someone else will.â€ Mr Quek continues to catch crabs in a sustainable manner, releasing juvenile crabs that he catches that are too small back to the wild. He has also taken on a ten-year-old apprentice who is eager to learn the skills of a fisherman.

Mr Ahmad Kassim and his wife reside permanently on Pulau Ubin as of 2016. He arrived on the island with his father and his six siblings during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He remembered that life during the war period was difficult and their diet consisted mainly of tapioca. That was until the Japanese offered him and his family some work and they were paid in rice. However, as Ahmad recalled: â€œWhen we got the rice, we sold it to the Chinese. We took the money and went gambling.â€

When the war ended, Ahmad remembered the Communists taking over from the Japanese on the island. They came with machine guns, pistols and bayonets. However, after a week, the British returned to the island and chased the Communists out.
Ahmad also remembers a time when his fellow villagers used to call him Ahmad Janggut: Ahmad the Bearded. As of 2016, his family and his brother's family are the only ones left in Kampong Melayu.
NHB's year-long Pulau Ubin Cultural Mapping Project, concluded in April 2016, included a 25-minute documentary titled ""Life on Ubin"". The documentary presents the memories and experiences of current and former residents of Pulau Ubin.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/punggol-waves-of-recreation/story,"Text by Michelle Chan Yun Yee
MuseSG Volume 11 Issue 1 - 2018
In 1996, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (URA) published a brochure advertising Punggol as the â€œwaterfront town of the 21st centuryâ€. Indeed, Punggol has a longstanding heritage of being a town that boasts of living and relaxation by the waters. However, like a wave, the trajectory of Punggol's reputation as a waterfront recreational retreat has undergone a series of crests and troughs. Hailing back to the colonial era, Punggol's idyllic setting was first disrupted by the Japanese Occupation of Singapore from 1942-1945. Following the war, Punggol saw a re-emergence of its recreation scene. This resurgence, however, was again interrupted by the Northshore Reclamation Project during the late 1980s. In fact, it was only in the late 1990s that Punggol began to fully reclaim its name as a place for recreation, culminating in its image today as a waterfront town. This article explores Punggol's history, in particular its waterfront and recreational heritage, which has endured many moments in time to become what it is today.
Early Punggol
Today's Punggol refers to the area bounded by Tampines Expressway and the two rivers, Sungei Serangoon and Sungei Punggol. However, from the colonial era up to the 1970s, Punggol extended beyond this demarcation to include the sub-districts of Sengkang and Buangkok. This large historical boundary explains why Punggol has both coastal as well as agricultural characteristics; the latter further suggested by the meaning of its place name.
The first use of the name â€œPongulâ€ (eventually evolving into â€œPunggolâ€) was by John Turnbull Thomson in his 1844 land survey map. The etymology of the name â€œPunggolâ€ has many possible explanations, though they all share Malay origins. Also sometimes spelt as â€œPonggolâ€, the name means â€œhurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring the fruits down to the groundâ€.5 Alternatively, it can also be translated as â€œa place where fruits and forest produce are offered for wholesaleâ€, implying that Punggol was a rural, agricultural area.6 A third explanation involves the man who started Punggol village â€“ Wak Sumang. In an interview with the National Archives of Singapore, his great grandson Awang bin Osman claimed that Wak Sumang gave Punggol its name after obtaining the go-ahead from the British government to start a new village.7 While Wak Sumang was clearing his garden, a large tree was burnt and its branch, known as punggur in Malay, fell on his hut. He then decided to name the village â€œPunggurâ€.8 These interpretations of Punggol's etymology suggest origins based on its rural location and bucolic landscape.
Relaxing in Remote Punggol
Punggol's rural atmosphere and relative isolation from the Downtown Core of Singapore made it a suitable place for retreat and recreation. Punggol was so remote that it could only be accessed via two roads â€“ Serangoon Road and Punggol Road.9 In fact, public transport into Punggol was sorely lacking until 1935, when one bus route was finally introduced by the Ponggol Bus Service Company.10
Europeans living in Singapore certainly recognised that Punggol was the ideal retreat location since a few of them chose to build their bungalow-style country houses there. The Matilda House is one such bungalow that has withstood the test of time to become an iconic landmark in Punggol. Irish lawyer Alexander William Cashin built the Matilda House as a present for his wife, and it served as a weekend house for his family.11 It comprised an extensive fruit garden, and a view of the Punggol River estuary and the Straits of Johore.12 Boasting amenities such as stables and tennis courts, it provided its occupants with various sources of recreation.13 In fact, swimming in a pagar (a lagoon formed by stakes driven into the nearby sea) was something that his son Howard Cashin distinctly recalls.14 This perception of Punggol as an ideal place of retreat from the city was possibly what drew wealthy Europeans to build their houses there, forming the basis of Punggol's association with recreation.
Apart from the Europeans, other visitors were also drawn to Punggol by two major attractions â€“ the Japanese Fishing Pond and the Basapa Zoo. The Japanese Fishing Pond shifted from Changi to Punggol, opening on 24 December 1927.15 There, visitors could catch their own fish to cook and consume fresh from the waters.16 About a hundred yards away was the Basapa Ponggol Zoo.17 Owned by William Lawrence Soma Basapa, in 1928, it moved from its original location at Serangoon Road to a 10-hectare plot near the Punggol seafront along the former Track 22 as it had grown too large for its previous location.18 The zoo was immensely popular among local residents, especially on weekends.20 The zoo also won praise with a generous feature in Sir Roland Braddell's 1934 book, The Lights of Singapore. Inside, the zoo was described as â€œa truly delightful placeâ€ and that â€œa trip to the zoo is one of the things that no visitor should omit; it has a personality entirely its own, and is pitched in beautiful surroundings on the Straits of Johoreâ€.20 Being Singapore's only zoo at that time, it was commonly dubbed â€œthe Singapore Zooâ€, even though it was privately owned.21
Peace Disrupted
The arrival of the Japanese in 1942 severely disrupted the serenity of Punggol. The first salvo was fired when the British ordered Basapa to relocate his animals and birds within 24 hours as they wanted to use the Basapa Zoo land for defence against the imminent Japanese arrival.22 Basapa failed to do so and the British shot his animals and freed the birds.23 True enough, the Japanese used Punggol Beach as one point of entry to invade Singapore.24
During the Japanese Occupation, Punggol was infamously known for the Sook Ching massacres. Sook Ching, meaning purging through cleansing in Chinese, was conducted by the Japanese occupiers and primarily targeted Chinese communities perceived to be hostile to the Japanese. The process began with screening of Chinese men aged 18 to 50 by Japanese Kempeitai officers and their informants. Those singled out as anti-Japanese would be arrested and brought to one of the several sites designated for execution. Punggol Point was one of them. On 28 February 1942, about 300 Chinese civilians were executed by the auxiliary military police firing squad at Punggol.25 The Indian Daily Mail reported an elderly fisherman, Peh Ah Boh, visiting Punggol after the massacre and personally witnessing more than ten corpses floating on the waterfront.26 The legacy of the Sook Ching on Punggol stretches as far as 1998, when a newspaper report called Punggol Point the â€œSlaughter Beachâ€. It reported that â€œ[a] man digging for earthworms to use as fishing bait... found parts of a human skeleton insteadâ€.27

Apart from animals and humans, Punggol's infrastructure was also badly affected with the majority of bungalows as well as the Japanese Fishing Pond destroyed. Punggol's recreation scene had become almost non-existent. Through the Japanese Occupation, Punggol gained a new reputation, not associated with recreation but with death and destruction.
Recreation Resuscitation
After the Japanese Occupation, life slowly seeped back into Punggol. In spite of the beach's darkened history, residents living near the coast continued life as before. For these residents, the waterfront was an integral part of their lives. Abigail Chew, who lived near Punggol Point in the late 1970s, recalls: â€œThe sea was so near my home that it would hit against the fence [of my house].â€28 Her daughter, Anna Chew, still has memories of playing at the beach, wading into the sea and climbing into the sampans tied to stakes.29
It was during this post-war period that Punggol's reputation as a place for recreation grew in prominence once more. Remnants of old attractions in Punggol could be seen, albeit with some differences. For instance, in 1963, Chan Kim Suan, a landowner and animal lover, opened another zoo at Punggol.30 Called â€œSingapore Zooâ€, it had only 70 animals, making it significantly smaller than Basapa Zoo, which had comprised 200 animals and 2,000 birds during its peak. Furthermore, it was less popular than Basapa's zoo as it was visited mainly by Chan's friends.31

Singapore Zoo shuttered in the early 1970s due to financial woes.32 Apart from the return of the zoo, a newly built Ponggol Rest House also occupied the site of the former Japanese Fishing Pond.33 Claiming to be the â€œideal seaside health resortâ€, it boasted a hotel, bar and restaurant, and featured activities such as picnics, boating, water skiing, fishing and swimming.34
However, it was the new attractions established over the subsequent decades that really brought Punggol back to life, adding to its bustle. One major draw to Punggol was its seafood offerings. A notable example would be the Sea Palace Kelong Restaurant cum Nite-Club set up in Punggol in 1969.35 It was Singapore's only kelong-style restaurant nightclub and was built over stilts at Punggol Point, providing a novel seaside experience for diners.36 Moreover, it was said that its seafood could not come any fresher as they were caught right off the surrounding waters.37 Unfortunately, the restaurant burnt down in 1972 due to unknown reasons and never reopened again.38

Nevertheless, this did not spell the demise of the food scene at Punggol as other seafood restaurants continued to draw in the crowds. The cluster of seafood restaurants at Punggol Point became known as Seafood Village, where chilli crab, butter prawns and deep fried baby squid became part of a list of must-order dishes. Writing in The Straits Times in 1990, Margaret Chan describes the atmosphere of Seafood Village:
Eating seafood at Punggol Point is like eating seafood nowhere else in the world. Imagine on a weekend night, a crowd of 6,000 at one sitting... the Ponggol Restaurant alone sits almost 2,000 at one time. If this is not exciting enough, take a table at the end of the road so that you can eat while massive SBS buses negotiate three-point turns within touching distance of you. Talk about living dangerously.39
The competition between restaurants and the good quality of Punggol's seafood cemented Punggol's reputation as the go-to place for delicious seafood and waterfront dining.

Water sports were another type of activity that added to the bustle of Punggol. Fishing, for example, had gained such a repute that then Vice-President of USA Richard Nixon asked about it during his visit to Singapore in 1953.40 In addition, skiing and boating were also done along the coastline.41 Punggol Beach was the choice venue for a number of events such as the Singapore Powerboat Association 1982 Regatta, 1983 7-Up Water Ski Series and 1983 Easter Boat Show.42 By 1986, there were eight boatels (waterside hotels) in Punggol, including Marina Beach Resort, which was one of the largest in Singapore.43 Besides providing docking facilities for travellers' boats, the boatels also rented out boats for water-skiing, fishing and sightseeing.44

Indeed, the post-war era in Punggol saw a resurgence of the area's recreational scene. With the many attractions and events associated with its waterfront location, Punggol's identity and heritage as a place of recreation was cemented.
Waterfront Town of the 21st Century
In 1982, it was announced that Punggol would be redeveloped in the mid-1990s.45 The reclamation of land under the Northeastern Coast Reclamation Project would establish Punggol Town, which would eventually become a waterfront residential town of the 21st century, as envisioned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Housing & Development Board (HDB).46
These redevelopment plans affected the sea-fronting and pig farming industries located further inland.47 The latter was part of an official nationwide plan to curb pollution by phasing out pig farming and importing pork instead.48 The last of 22 pig farms in Punggol closed by November 1990, with some former farm owners shifting to hydroponic vegetable and orchid farming, as well as other businesses.49 In order to make way for land reclamation, the boatels, seafood restaurants and people living between Punggol Track One and Seven were given till the end of 1994 to relocate.50 Once developmental work went into full swing, Punggol's former recreation scene receded from the public eye.

Even though redevelopment plans hit a snag during the 1990s and early 2000s due to the Asian Financial Crisis, Punggol Town today is finally experiencing a revitalised recreation scene.51 Some of the new amenities in Punggol have their roots in the past, representing a continuity with Punggol's heritage. One example is Punggol Marina Club. Although Punggol's boatels of the 1980s were closed due to land reclamation works in the early 1990s, they returned in the form of the Punggol Marina Club, which opened in 1996.52 This private club was formed by a group of former Punggol boatel owners (namely Awang Boat Sheds, Zainal Water-ski Centre, Marina View and Yap Boatel), who helped to provide temporary boat storage facilities during the redevelopment phase.53 Another example is the Punggol Settlement at Punggol Point, which was completed in 2014.54 Punggol Settlement currently houses a number of seafood restaurants, reminiscent of the former Seafood Village. Ponggol Seafood Restaurant, which was at Punggol Point from 1969 to 1994, has even returned, joining the other restaurants at Punggol Settlement.55

In addition, a new water catchment area named Punggol Waterway was also opened in 2015.56 Waterfront living now resurfaces through the HDB flats, a shopping mall named Waterway Point, the SAFRA complex and the Punggol Polyclinic, which flank the waterway. Coney Island, opened in 2015, was another integral part of the envisioned Waterfront Town.57 Developed as a park and green space, Coney Island is linked by bridge to the Punggol Waterway Park Connector.58 These recreation amenities have added to Punggol's waterfront legacy, honouring its heritage and perpetuating its identity as a place for recreation.59

Conclusion
While Punggol's reputation as a retreat space has gone through numerous crests and troughs, it is undeniable that waterfront recreation has always been an integral part of its identity. Although the waterfront branding was an intentional effort made by physical planners, this identity is one that has roots in the area's heritage. At the same time, the events of the Japanese Occupation also imprinted the tragedy of the Sook Ching massacres onto the town's history. For the generation that went through the Japanese Occupation, Punggol Beach will always be associated with the suffering that many experienced during this period â€“ so much so that the beach gained the moniker: â€œSingapore's Slaughter Beachâ€.60
Nevertheless, for others â€“ especially the younger generation of Singaporeans â€“ this dark past does not eclipse the exciting recreational offerings that Punggol is known for today. As Francis Tan, a restaurant owner at Punggol Settlement, says: â€œI don't let the dark past get to me. I chose this place for my restaurant because it has a beautiful view of the sea.â€61 The redevelopment of Punggol has undoubtedly brought about a new commitment to its reputation as a waterfront town, giving the place its new nickname â€“ â€œwaterwayâ€. With Punggol reclaiming its historical identity, the area has come full circle, with new generations of Singaporeans now sharing in and expanding the collective memory of Punggol's waterfront heritage.

The Discovery
Shining their torches into the dark depths, the archaeologists were astonished to see gleaming articles of gold and silver packed into a stone chamber. It was April 3, 1987, and this was their first sight of the crypt beneath the Famen Temple pagoda, which had been built in the early 17th century. Structurally weakened by earthquake tremors and age, the pagoda had collapsed after a period of heavy rainfall on August 24, 1981. Local authorities had decided to rebuild the pagoda after its dramatic fall, leading to a full-scale excavation of the site â€“ and one of China's major archaeological discoveries of the twentieth century.
Foundations of the Famen Temple Pagoda in 1987, The steps in the foreground lead to the three chambers of the crypt. The raised squares on the perimeter are the foundations of the Tang Wooden Pagoda. The circulate depression in the centre is the foundation of the Ming Stone Pagoda.
Not one, but three chambers containing a rich variety of items were discovered in the underground complex. The subterranean structure, which included a flight of stairs and a corridor leading to the three successive rooms, measured 21.1 metres in its entire length and 2 to 2.55 metres in width. This was the large Tang pagoda crypt found to date and contained hundreds of objects, which included gold and silver utensils, precious ceramics, rare Islamic glassware, silk textiles, and one carvings. But most significant among the finds was the finger bone relic of the Buddha. In fact four finger bone relics were recovered, one in each of the three chambers and the fourth in a tiny squarish compartment hidden beneath the rear chamber.
This fourth relic is purported to be the genuine one, referred to in Chinese sources as the zhen shen (â€œtrue bodyâ€ relic) and the ling gu (çµéª¨, â€œspirit boneâ€), while the other three relics found in the three main chambers are described as ying gu (å½±éª¨, â€œshadow boneâ€). Two of these ying gu were made of jade and the third of bone, and they may have served as decoys to protect the true relic during religious persecutions in the mid-ninth century.
The Famen Temple was one of four Buddhist sites in China reputed to house the fingerbone relic of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. The other three were Puguangwangsi in Sizhou, Jiangsu province; Mount Wutai in Daizhou, Shanxi province; and Wutai in Mount Zhongnan, Shaanxi province. Traces of the relics at these other locations have, however, lost over time.1
The partly collapsed pagoda of the Famen Temple in 1981.
The Famen Temple
Famensi (æ³•é—¨å¯º), also known as Famen Temple or Famen Monastery, is situated approximately 110 km west of Xi'an in Fufeng county, Shaanxi province. Its beginnings remain obscure but its history with the Buddha's relics is legendary. The Famen Temple was believed to be founded in the Eastern Han dynasty (25â€“220), when it was known as Ayuwangsi (é˜¿è‚²çŽ‹å¯º or AsÌoka Temple). The relic at the site was also associated with King AsÌoka (reigned 269â€“232 BC) of the Mauryan dynasty, who according to Buddhist tradition re-collected Buddha's relics and re-dispersed them to 84,000 stupas. What has been determined with greater certainty, however, is that the finger bone relic was worshipped in 555. This was the first time the veneration of the Buddhist relic at the Famensi site was recorded in writing.
This textual evidence came from one of two one steles found within the crypt. Inscribed in 874, this one stele provides a broad overview of the history of Famen Temple. It outlines the various occasions on which the relic was worshipped, and describes in particular detail the final occasion when the relic was conveyed to the capital city in 873. During the Tang dynasty, the relic was first worshipped in 631 upon the orders of Emperor Taizong (reigned 626â€“649). Other Tang rulers continued with the practice and the crypt was accessed in 660, 704, 760, 790, 819, and 873. Venerating the relic was believed to invoke good fortune and protective blessings for oneself and the empire.
On each of these occasions, the relic was conveyed to the imperial palaces at Chang'an (and sometimes Luoyang, the secondary capital of Tang China) amid much ceremonial splendour. It incited great religious fervour among the devout masses, and extreme acts of piety such as self-immolation were also noted. New offerings were likely to have been made each time the relic was re-interred at the Famen Temple, but most of these items did not survive the suppression of Buddhism in the mid-ninth century. Thus the majority of objects from the Famen Temple crypt are dated after this period and associated with the Emperors Yizong (859â€“873) and Xizong (873â€“888), the last two Tang emperors who participated in the veneration of the relic.
The Secret Treasures
340 items and sets of items were excavated from the Famen Temple crypt, a figure which excludes the thousands of coins found.2 It also does not reflect the full quantity of textiles that had been originally placed in the crypt, as conservation work on this aspect is ill ongoing. Not only is this an impressive quantity of objects recovered from a single site, the quality of these items is exquisite. Many objects are unprecedented in form and/or decoration, including several rare works featuring Esoteric Buddhist iconography, such as the reliquary casket decorated with forty-five Buddhist figures. This is the earliest known visual representation of the Diamond Realm mandala in China, one of two major realms in Esoteric Buddhism.3

The objects â€“ serving both religious and secular functions â€“ were mostly presented by members of the Tang royal household for the veneration of the Buddhist relic. They had access to some of the finest objects manufactured and, as inscriptions on several of the excavated metal wares indicate, these included products from the imperial workshops in Chang'an as well as tributes from key metal-smithing centres in the southern part of China. The boldly-ornamented, tiered incense burner and the sumptuously decorated basin represent these production areas respectively. They are also two of the large surviving examples of Tang metalwork known at present.

The discovery also yielded one of the most comprehensive sets of utensils used for the preparation and drinking of tea, highlighting the popularity of the beverage in ninth-century China. Noted for its many benefits, tea was enjoyed across Tang society. The royal court was no exception and tea appears to have been particularly loved by Emperor Xizong. Several of the Famen Temple tea utensils are inscribed with the characters â€œäº”å“¥â€ (wu ge or fifth brother), a reference to the monarch's infant name, which suggests that the objects were used specifically by him.
The imperial connection is emphasized by the ""wu ge"" inscription on the roller and the base of the grinder. Tea grinder, dated 869. Partly gilded silver, length 27.4 cm. Roller: diameter 8.9 cm.

Enhancing the significance of the find is the fact that the majority of these objects were recorded in the second stone stele found in the crypt. This was essentially an inventory checklist that listed the names, quantity, and weight of objects, as well as the donors who had given them to the Famen Temple. The information gleaned from this list has enabled archaeologists and scholars to gain important insights into Tang China, such as the system of measurements that was used then. This is currently the only inventory stele that has been excavated from an archaeological site in China, making it a unique and invaluable piece of epigraphical evidence.
The inscribed information on the inventory stele has also been key to the identification of mi se (ç§˜è‰²) or â€œsecret colourâ€ porcelain. â€œSecret colourâ€ ceramics were widely celebrated in poetry during the Tang and succeeding dynasties, when their lustrous appearance was compared to the â€œemerald green of a thousand peaksâ€ and â€œfresh lotus leaves covered with dewâ€. However, the actual colour of these ceramics remained a mystery until the discovery of the Famen Temple crypt and its contents, when thirteen excavated celadon vessels were matched with the inscriptions on the stele. These precious ceramics with a bluish-green hue had been produced at the Yue kilns in northern Zhejiang province, where they were made with the finest materials and under strict firing conditions.

Another group of rare finds from the Famen Temple crypt are eighteen pieces of glassware imported from the Middle East. Of various forms and designs, this cache of treasures constitutes the largest group of early Islamic glass vessels (found in mostly intact conditions) currently known in China. Deemed an exotic luxury in Tang China, Islamic glass was valued for its beauty, strength, and transparency. Its preciousness made it suitable for making containers for housing relics, such as the bottle placed in the rear chamber of the crypt. The bottle was found with a fragmentary slip of paper inked with two lines of characters, of which only twoâ€” â€œtrueâ€ (çœŸ) and â€œlotusâ€ (èŽ²)â€”remain legible. This suggests that the vessel may have contained a relic of the Buddha; the lotus is a Buddhist symbol, and the finger bone relic is referred to as the True Body on the inventory stele.
Bottle, Syrian-Palestinian region, probably 7th or 8th century glass, height 21.3cm.

Indeed, we can only speculate about many aspects of the Famen Temple and its contents. While it has been an invaluable time capsule that has enriched our knowledge of Tang society, much remains enigmatic, awaiting further resolution by current and future scholars.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2014
Memorials or monuments that commemorate past wars are often intended to remind people of intensely-fought battles for national glory and triumph. At times, they serve as testimony to certain shared experiences fundamental to establishing a common destiny. Oftentimes, these sites - and what they represent - are also used to achieve larger political and social purposes, such as to instill patriotism and foster national identity, create collective memory, as well as imbue a sense of ""continuity"" of the historical legacies to be imparted to succeeding generations.
War memorials, monuments dedicated to past wars, and statues dedicated to military heroes are excellent historical sites that provide opportunities for young people to critically reflect the history they learn in classrooms, and evoke ideas and feelings they have about war, patriotism, and peace. Historical field trips to these sites can develop students' sense of empathy as they consider how different people were affected, and continue to be affected, by war and the ways war is represented in their cultures.
As history educators, we are frequently designing fieldwork activities to engage students in more critical and empathetic engagements with historical sites. Combined with an inquiry approach to fieldwork, we believe historical field trips can help students become careful and critical readers of artefacts, architecture, sites, monuments, historical markets, and museum displays as visual representations or sources of evidence about the past. The sites that students encounter on such trips can be critically analyzed, interpreted, and evaluated like other historical sources, instead of being passively received.
In this article, we offer guiding questions for historical field trips to help students ""read"" war memorials and monuments critically and with empathy. We define critical reading of historical sites as questioning how knowledge about the past is constructed and used. Tis means asking critical questions about why historical sites are created, techniques used to represent the past, and how they try to shape ideas people have about the past. Developing a disposition to empathise requires students to think about how different contexts, events, and issues shaped or affected people's lives and past actions. Empathetic readings require students to infer how people felt and thought in the past, based on evidence that memorials and monuments provide.
Gravestones at the Kranji War Memorial
""Reading"" Monuments and Memorials
Historical sites that represent particular interpretations or views of the past are often subject to intense debates both within and between societies. Helping students understand that historical sites can be read critically and with empathy is one way students can begin to interrogate different meanings associated with such sites, as well as their own and others' perspectives of these sites and the pasts they represent. Reading monuments for evidence, however, requires that students ask particular questions about the site(s) they are investigating.
We use the following guiding questions to help students critically read historical sites:
What does this site tell me about the past?
Describe the people, objects, symbols, actions, etc. that you see.
What information about the past does the site provide?
Who sponsored or created the site, and why was it created?
What might they want viewers or visitors to think, believe or do? Explain.
What techniques are used to influence me as a viewer?
Why are certain objects or people shown or placed where they are?
How are words, symbols or images used to influence what I think or feel?
An empathetic reading requires students to think carefully about the perspectives others might have about the sight and the past it represents. Some empathy-related questions include:
What clues does the site provide about what people thought, felt, or did in the past?
What evidence from the site supports my ideas?
What contexts help me understand what people thought, felt, or did?
What values or ideas are expressed through this site?
In what ways does the site help me understand the perspectives people had about a particular part of the past?
What evidence from the site supports my ideas?
What are other ways different people might think or feel about this site and the history it represents?
How might someone from a different country, culture, or perspective think and feel about this site and the history that it represents?
Why might they have different reactions?
These questions can be tailored more specifically for students to directly engage with the war memorial or monument it was designed to commemorate.
Using Critical and Empathetic Questions with a War Memorial in Singapore
While any number of war memorials or monuments could be used for this activity, we selected the Kranji War Memorial to demonstrate how these critical and empathetic questions might be used with students. The answers to each question are written as first-person responses that might be typical of a student visiting the site.
Gravestones and cross at the Kranji War Memorial
What does the site tell me about the past?
The Kranji War Memorial has several different areas and features. Each feature of the memorial includes different symbols and information about World War II and Singapore. A large Stone of Remembrance marks the entrance to the site and a gentle slope with gravestones leads up to the War Memorial at the top. The War Memorial columns represent the three branches of the military. The columns symbolize a marching Army; the cover over the columns represents the Air Force; there is a shape at the top of the memorial that resembles a Navy periscope. The memorial's walls making up each column include the names of over 24,000 allied servicemen who lost their lives in the war. There is a memorial cross at the site.
The memorial mainly provides the perspectives of the British Crown and Commonwealth nations that fought on behalf of Singapore and Malaya against the Japanese. It emphasises in bold letters that their deaths were for all free men. It tells me that the war and the great loss of life during the war were for freedom and to protect Singapore and Malaya from military aggression.
Who created the site and why was it created?
The site has great historical significance. Prior to the war, it was a British military camp and stored ammunition magazines. After Singapore fell, it was used by the Japanese as a prisoner-of-war camp. After the war ended, the site in 1946 was designated as Singapore's war cemetery, and military personnel who had been buried in other areas of Singapore were exhumed and buried at the Kranji site. This provided a central place of rest for the war dead and a focal point for remembrance of the war.
The memorial was designed by a Scottish architect, Colin St Clair Oakes, and was built to commemorate those who sacrificed their lives for Britain and its colony (Malaya) in World War II. These included military personnel from the UK, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Singapore. The site is located in the north of Singapore where the Japanese invaded. The creators of the site probably wanted visitors to remember the lives that were lost and feel the loss in very real terms (by the tombs and names engraved on the memorial walls).
What techniques are used to influence me as a viewer?
The phrase ""They died for all free men"" and the engraving on the Stone of Remembrance that ""Their name liveth for evermore"" give the military deaths a much greater significance than solely defending Singapore and Malaya. Since the Japanese invaded and occupied Singapore, it connotes that although Singapore fell, the lives of the soldiers were not lost in vain.
The many rows of tombs as well as the names engraved on the memorial walls provide a powerful reminder of the many lives lost during the war. This makes me think of the sacrifice and great loss caused by the war.
The cross with a sword symbolizes military might. This is called a cross of sacrifice and it is apparently quite common in Commonwealth war cemeteries. The cross and swords pointing downward represent resting. While the cross of sacrifice suggests a religious focal point of the cemetery (as a symbol of Christianity), the Stone of Remembrance represents all faiths and shows the diversity of those commemorated by the memorial.
What clues does the site provide about what people thought, felt, or did in the past?
The creators of the site want people to know that the dead commemorated at the memorial gave their lives for freedom. A sign in Singapore's four official languages reminds viewers to preserve the peace and dignity of the site. It reminds viewers that people place great importance on the war and the loss of life and that it should always remain a significant place of respect for visitors.
The many plaques highlighting key battles during the war also display important information about the war that people should know. Not only is it a place that represents deep emotion for the fallen, solemn observation and reflection, it also is designed to inform. The plaques provide contextual information about the battle that helps viewers understand the historical contexts of the war and the war dead.
What values or ideas are expressed through the site?
The memorial reminds me of other war monuments or memorials that I've seen that similarly commemorate the war dead. It expresses the tragedy of the devastation and death caused by World War II, but also wants viewers to honour those who died. The inscription of ""They died for all free men"" makes me think that I should feel a certain indebtedness to those who died. It makes me think that maybe they died so that I might live in freedom. The idea or value of freedom, and that it has to be defended, seems central to the memorial.
By owing the names of every person who died, it marks the individual contributions made on behalf of the defence of Singapore and freedom. The people who constructed this site want future generations to remember the sacrifices made during the war so that Singaporeans and other visitors to the site may appreciate the importance of freedom and the need to defend it.
What are other ways different people might think or feel about this site and the history it represents?
Other people may have different interpretations and reactions to this site. If a member of your family had lost someone in the war, I think there would be a much more emotional reaction to the site. The site's plaque tell me more about the war - why it was fought, who else died, how it ended, etc. - so, it seems to want me to acknowledge the contribution made by the dead supposedly on the behalf of Singaporeans.
I think other people might have very different perspectives of the war, because people usually view war in very different ways depending on their values or backgrounds. Some might be angry at the loss of life caused by the war. Some might feel great sadness, and others might see this as a representation of the British Empire or colonial power, rather than having anything to do with Singapore. I know that many things are missing about the war and that the site wants me to focus only on honouring the dead.
The site also doesn't seem to acknowledge the lives of ordinary civilians who died during the war. There were many civilians in Singapore, for example, who resisted the Japanese and lost their lives. Their deaths are not commemorated at the site.

Conclusion
The questions we have proposed can be an integral part of historical fieldwork. They encourage students to consider the purpose of constructing war memorials and monuments, and also encourage students to think about and question their own and others' responses to these sites and to war. These questions can empower teachers and students to more fully understand how the past, present, and future are constructed through the interpretive practices that make up historical inquiry.
By giving students the opportunity to challenge accepted versions of the past (including their own) and develop their own or alternative interpretive accounts, they might better understand the role history education can play during peace-time.
Reading the past with empathy requires students to consider the perspectives and emotions of those affected by war, both in the past and the present. Through empathetic understanding, teachers and students can begin to consider how war impacts different people, the views on war and peace that others may hold, as well as their own responses to war and its consequences.

Historical films are the most difficult types of film to make because in a way the script has already been written. Past events are immutable, which challenges the scriptwriter and director's creativity, style and approach. Get it wrong and academics will challenge the film for historical inaccuracy or film critics will criticise its historical authenticity. The historian Mark Carnes reminds us that there is a difference between reel history and real history. According to his 2004 book Shooting (Down) the Past, Historians vs. Hollywood, reel history is comprehensible and accessible as it â€œunfolds according to the dramatic conventions with which audiences are familiarâ€ and real history is complicated as the â€œplot lines skitter in every direction and seldom terminate in clear pointsâ€.
In 2016, as part of the celebrations for Singapore's 50 years of independence, two filmmakers were commissioned to make two separate films about Pulau Ubin â€“ an island situated on the northeast of Singapore's main island. The island's heyday was from the 1950s to the 1970s, when the island had a population of around 2,000, most of whom were working in the granite quarries or in supporting industries like the Food & Beverage industry. The population declined after the quarries closed down and the island took on a different role as the last of Singapore's island kampong community.

The first film â€“ Homecoming, is by Singaporean filmmaker, Royston Tan. He was commissioned by the National Museum of Singapore to produce a film on Ubin as part of the National Heritage Board's annual Singapore Heritage Festival. The film's plot follows an old man as he travels back to Ubin to reconnect with his past. On his trip, he meets with people who are either working or living on the island and they share with him personal stories on their family background, how they arrived in Ubin and why they stayed. There is a feeling of nostalgia throughout the film as the old man revisits the places of his childhood and youth, only to discover that they have mostly vanished. At the broader level, the film reflects the way Singaporeans engage with heritage issues.
The second film â€“ Life on Ubin, is made by budding independent filmmaker, Clarice Lee. She was commissioned to make a film as part of the National Heritage Board's cultural mapping project.

The story of Ubin is presented in a series of interviews with the residents of the island who share stories about their past and present lives on Ubin. This film does not have a central character or even a narrator to string together all of the narratives. Yet the narratives come together in a magical and charming way that tell the story of Ubin â€“ past and present. It reflects the real history of the island community.

Both films move in different directions to present the realities of life in Ubin and Singapore, succeeding realistically to portray a slice of Singapore's heritage from the perspective of Singaporeans in 2015 for audiences in the future. This is the power of historical films when the filmmakers get it right.

Progress of ICH Survey
The National Heritage Board has embarked on a nationwide survey on intangible cultural heritage (ICH) in Singapore as of 2018. ICH elements such as oral traditions and expressions; performing arts; social practices, rituals and festive events; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe; and traditional craftsmanship will be surveyed in the project. This survey is running in tandem with the heritage survey covering tangible heritage in Singapore.

It is often said that arts and culture are the preserve of the privileged. However, the National Heritage Board, with all its national museums, creates access for all. This is why I feel that the HeritageCares programme, for which I volunteered, is such a great initiative. While recognising that our shared heritage is relevant and important for all Singaporeans, it also acknowledges that its reception and use may vary for different audiences, all of which are equally valid and meaningful.
Hence HeritageCares has, as its primary aim, not to be a high-handed information-heavy teaching vehicle, but a platform for family bonding, social skills and quality educational experiences. The beneficiaries of this programme are currently the underprivileged being supported by Community Chest â€“ low-income families, people with disabilities, youths-at-risk and senior citizens. The programmes under HeritageCares are facilitated by volunteers who function as both buddies and guides.
Before the official launch, a pilot run of the programme was held, with the route based around a section of the Jubilee Walk trail. The attendees were largely children from low-income families, many with accompanying parents and some without. Hailing from three Family Service Centres, they woke up early on a Saturday morning for a rather unusual outing that began at the National Museum. Here the volunteers, including myself, greeted the participants and divided them into smaller groups that each of us would chaperone.
I accompanied a family of four, which included two young kids. The parents had never been to a museum in their lives. Despite this being something I had been told to expect, it was difficult for someone such as myself, who frequently spends spare time walking through the calm spaces of museums and galleries, to imagine. What surprised me even more was the fact that the parents I was with immediately removed the notebooks from the goodie bag they had been given and started taking notes from the first gallery we took them to. This touched me, because it was clearly their first opportunity to experience the museum, and they really wanted to make the most of it by recording their memories to take home.
Another sweet moment occurred at our last stop, the Peranakan Museum, which the elder son remembered from a previous school trip. He was really excited and eager to share his knowledge with his parents, and distinctly remembered certain facts about objects that his teacher had shared with him previously. While the facts were interesting, the more important thing was that they became a medium for bonding between him and his parents. By sharing, he reinforced his knowledge, and gave himself greater confidence in his own competence and understanding of the cultural domain. Seeing how much the participants got out of this walk while also enjoying themselves through the entire event was truly the greatest reward.
If you too would like to do some meaningful volunteering at HeritageCares events, please get in touch with us at Volunteers@nhb.gov.sg

Situated at the crossroads of the Indian Ocean region and the Far East, the Malay Archipelago has always been a region of cultural confluence and diversity. The region experienced an influx of migrant communities which brought with them their unique socio-cultural traits ranging from language to religion, fashion to cuisine. Over time, these traits adapted to the multicultural milieu of the local society and resulted in polyglot environments best exemplified by the Chetti Melaka.
The Chetti Melaka (or Chitty Melaka) are descendants of Tamil traders who settled in Melaka during the reign of the Melaka Sultanate (15th â€“ 16th centuries) and married local women of Malay and Chinese descent. Predominantly Hindu of the Saivite (followers of Shiva) denomination, the community speaks a unique combination of Malay, Tamil and Chinese, which has been called Chetti Creole by scholars. They trace their roots to Kampung Chetti in Gajah Berang, Melaka, and it is estimated that there are 5000 Chetti Melaka in Singapore.
The Indian Heritage Centre (IHC), in collaboration with the Peranakan Indian (Chitty Melaka) Association Singapore, proudly presents Chetti Melaka of the Straits â€“ Rediscovering Peranakan Indian Communities, the first of IHC's community co-created exhibitions.

Who are the Chetti Melaka?
The story of the Chetti Melaka community is relatively unexplored and waiting to be discovered and documented. Who are the Chetti Melaka? Where are they located? What is their story? Discover the answers to these questions through this introductory film produced by the Indian Heritage Centre.
Shot in Singapore and Melaka in documentary style, this film presents the journey of two Chetti Melaka youth in search of their roots, and unearths lesser known facets of the Chetti Melaka in Singapore. On a quest for their identity, the protagonists re-examine the importance of their heritage as many young Chetti Melaka have lost touch with their root culture.
The film also contemplates the future of Singapore's relatively unknown Chetti community and documents how the Chetti Melaka are struggling to preserve their identity, heritage and culture. Through the use of oral history interviews, archival photographs and stylised re-enactments, the film provides a succinct overview of Singapore's contemporary Chetti Melaka community, its history and heritage.
Early Beginnings
Watch: Early Beginnings of the Chetti Melaka
During the 15th century, Malacca (now Melaka) was a bustling entrepÃ´t and attracted traders from across the world. South Indian traders arriving from the Coromandel Coast intermarried with local Malay and Chinese women, and established a Chetti Melaka community that survived the Malacca Sultanate and centuries of Portuguese, Dutch and British rule.
While these traders gradually absorbed local influences including Straits language, food and dress, they continued to adhere to their root religious practices. Over time, the descendants of such locally-settled traders from the Coromandel Coast came to be known as the Melaka-born Hindus or Chetti Melaka. Due to assistance rendered to them at the time of the conquest of Malacca, the Portuguese favoured the Chetti Melaka.
However, the fall of Melaka to the Dutch in 1641 and the ensuing Dutch trade monopoly forced the Chetti community to take up other occupations. The Dutch granted agricultural land to the influential Chetti community in the late 18th century outside the city walls. Over time, the area including Gajah Berang in Melaka became a designated village for the Chetti Melaka.
The 18th and 19th centuries marked a significant decline in the prosperity of the community. With the arrival of the British in 1795, the community found employment in the civil service, especially in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and other emergent towns outside Melaka.

For the Chetti Melaka, Gajah Berang is the only known home town since most Chettis are unaware of the places of origin of their forefathers in India. The majority of the Chetti families live in Land Lots 28, 94, 118 and 138, in clusters around Gajah Berang, Bachang and Tranquerah which constitute Kampung Chetti. This clustering of the community in Kampung Chetti has resulted in the preservation of the community's distinct lifestyle and cultural heritage.
The community's affairs and temple properties are managed by the community's headman in the style of the Indian panchayat (Hindi: village council) system. In accordance to Hindu practice where devotees donate properties to the service of the deity, a number of Chetti Melaka have donated lands to the Sri Poyatha Vinayagar Moorthi Temple Trust.
By the 1980s, scholars estimated that there were around 400 families living in Melaka. Since then, the size of the community has dwindled considerably and Melaka is home to fewer than fifty Chetti Melaka families today. However, Chetti families from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, who are now second or third-generation diaspora, still visit the kampung regularly, and in doing so, maintain their connections with their hometown.

By the time of the British occupation of Melaka, the port city was significantly diminished in importance. Conversely, by the early 20th century, Singapore had started to flourish as a cosmopolitan city and became a popular destination for Chetti Melaka migrants leaving Melaka. During this period, Singapore was under British rule and employment in the British civil service presented Chetti Melaka with opportunities for further education and economic advancement.
The migration of many young Chetti Melaka from Melaka to Singapore was further fuelled by the ease of travel and access to education, and they often found employment as accountants, clerks and administrative staff in the colonial service. Many Chetti Melaka also joined the police forces and held high ranking positions.
These early waves of migration were also made possible by pioneers such as Muthukrishnan Tevanathan Pillay, Arumugam Supramaniam Chitty and Arunasalam Sithambaram Pillay. After arriving in Singapore before World War II, these early migrants held influential posts and played a key role in facilitating the movement of other young aspirants who were seeking opportunities outside Melaka. It is believed that about 50 per cent of the Chetti community in Melaka migrated to Singapore to take up employment in the private sector or in the colonial government service.
Many of the early Chetti Melaka in Singapore became lawyers, teachers, government clerks, military, and/or police personnel. They included Mr Sandy Gurunathan Pillay, a successful lawyer and advocate as well as the President of the Indo-Malayan Association; and Mr Apoo Pillay (or Dollah as he was known), brother-in-law of Mr Pillay, who was employed in a legal firm.
Other early Chetti pioneers included Mr Ramasamy Suppiah Naidu who migrated from Melaka to Singapore around 1920 and joined the police force; and Mr Francis J Pillay who fought in defence of Singapore during World War II. After the war, Mr Pillay was transferred to the Executive Service in Singapore and later had an illustrious career in the Marine Department and Education Ministry.

Makan Chetti
Watch: Makan Chetti
Chetti Melaka cuisine is a fascinating blend of Indian, Malay and Nonya (Peranakan Chinese) culinary styles and offers a wide variety of delicacies for every occasion. For Chetti Melaka cuisine, traditional Indian spices are typically combined with Malay ingredients such as belacan (shrimp paste), serai (lemongrass), lengkuas (wild ginger), pandan leaf and coconut milk to create uniquely Chetti dishes.
Traditional Chetti Melaka favourites include ikan parang (fish curry), lauk pindang (fish in a tamarind curry), ikan sipat masek nanas (fish in a pineapple curry), and sambal belimbing (pickled sour fruit). The curry dishes are typically accompanied by rice dishes like nasi lemak (fragrant rice dish) prepared in a uniquely Chetti manner using cooled steamed rice boiled with coconut milk and pandan leaves.
For the Chetti Melaka, festivals and special occasions are marked by the preparation of specific dishes. For instance, Chetti Melaka prepare nasi lemak for prayer offerings and nasi kembuli (rice cooked with cashew nuts and spices) for new brides. Puttu, a traditional south Indian dish is served during the puberty ceremony while dosai (rice flour pancake) and fish curry, are associated with Deepavali.
As with many communities, food remains a central part of Chetti identity and brings the young and old together. For the Chetti Melaka, special occasions are marked by an abundance of sweets and cakes. These cakes are usually prepared using a combination of coconut, palm sugar and flour based on Malay recipes. Some popular Chetti Melaka cakes and desserts include pulot tekan, kwey wajek, kwey ondei ondei, kwey kanda kasturi, and penggat durian.

Chetti Creole
The mother tongue of the Chetti community is a Malay-based creole which reflects the diverse roots of the community. Termed Chetti Creole by researchers JA Grimes in 1996 and Noriah Mohamed in 2009, it is a rare mixture of the predominant languages of the Straits comprising Bazaar Malay, Tamil and Chinese. For instance, the terms for grandmother are nenek (Malay), grandfather thatha (Tamil) and uncle mama (Tamil) respectively.
Chetti Creole shares similarities with several Malay dialects and creole languages spoken in Singapore and Malaysia, including the Baba Nyonya Malay creole language of the Peranakan Chinese, the Melayu Ambon creole language and the Jakarta Malay creole language (Betawi Malay). It is also similar to the creole language spoken by Sri Lankan Malays.
The Malay language plays a key role in Chetti Creole and this is evident in the fact that the Chetti Melaka still pray in Malay while retaining some common Sanskrit and Tamil religious terms used by the Hindu Chetti. Besides the use of Malay terms and phrases, the Chetti Melaka are also fluent in English due to British influence. English is also used as a common medium of communication for day-to-day interactions with other ethnic groups as well as by Chetti Melaka who have married outside the community.

The traditional attire of the Chetti Melaka is an indicator of cross-cultural influences over time and mirrors centuries of Javanese, Bugis, Achenese, Batak and Tamil styles. Within the community, the traditional attire for men comprises a checkered sarong like the kain pulicat or the batik sarong, a tunic and a headgear of knotted batik cloth called talapa (headgear). Chetti Melaka men traditionally wore wooden clogs with silver pegs although these clogs have since been replaced by leather slippers.
The traditional attire for women comprised the sarong kebaya and the baju kurung, fastened with three keronsang(brooches). Affluent Chetti Melaka women also wore brooches made with gold studded with diamonds for their baju panjang. These brooches and other accessories were often crafted by Tamil goldsmiths, and featured elements such as addiggai (a gold choker usually studded with semi-precious stones), thali (a wedding pendant), and silambu (anklets).
In addition to local and Tamil styles, jewellery and accessories for women also reflected British influence and 20th century British gold sovereigns were often worn as pendants. The women also wore their hair in tight buns called sanggul nyonya which are held together using a combination of three hair pins, and their footwear comprised beaded slippers known as kasut manek-manek, which were often painstakingly handmade over many weeks.

Celebrating the Chetti Way
Watch: Celebrating the Chetti Way
  Traditionally, the Chetti Melaka community were staunch followers of Saivite Hinduism and key Chetti Melaka festivals coincide with major religious events in the Tamil Hindu calendar. These include including Pongal (Harvest Festival), Mahashivratri (Festival of Shiva), Puthandu (Tamil New Year), Navaratri (Festival of Nine Nights) and Deepavali. As the Chetti community also includes many Christians, Christmas and Easter are also important festivals for the community.
The most important annual festival, Sembahyang Dato Chachar or Megammay Thiruvizha, is dedicated to the goddess Mariamman. During the festival, thousands of devotees attend the festivities held at the Muthu Mariamman Temple in Gajah Berang. Other temples such as the Kailasanthar and Angalamman Paramesvari, also host festivals dedicated to their central deities, such as Mahashivratri and Theemithi, albeit on a smaller scale.
While some festivals are celebrated at the temples, there are also many home-based observances and ritual practices. The most notable Chetti observances are the parachu prayers that take place twice a year â€“ Bhogi in January and Parachu Buah Buahan in July. Both prayers are dedicated to ancestor worship and involve the preparation of special foods laid out in odd-numbered banana leaves for the ancestors to partake.
Although these festival related ritual practices were strictly adhered to in the past, few families outside Melaka continue to observe them when celebrating traditional Chetti Melaka festivals today.
From Cradle to Grave: Ceremonies and Rituals
Watch: From Cradle to Grave: Ceremonies and Rituals
The Chetti Melaka community's lifecycle rituals and ceremonies closely follow traditional Tamil Hindu practices. They include coming-of-age ceremonies such as kaadhu kuthal (ear piercing) for both girls and boys, and the fertility ceremony sadanggu for girls to mark puberty. The latter 16-day long, female-only ceremony is held at home, and the girl is ritually bathed, given special foods and blessed by the women of the family.
The traditional wedding rituals for the Chetti community are elaborate, and the wedding typically takes place between four days to three weeks. The key components of a Chetti wedding include parisom (engagement ceremony), hantar sireh koil pathiram (delivery of the invitation card to the temple), berhinai (application of henna), menepah thali (making the wedding pendant), berarak (wedding procession) and the wedding ceremony itself.
The Chetti Melaka practice burying their dead and, according to traditional Chetti Melaka funerary practices, the deceased would be bathed, dressed and placed in a coffin, and carried by men to the cemetery. In Melaka and Singapore, deceased Chetti Melaka would be buried at Batu Berendam and Choa Chu Kang Hindu Cemetery respectively.
In Singapore, many Chetti Melaka life cycle rituals and ceremonies are rapidly evolving or even disappearing. Many Chetti families have forsaken traditional Hindu practices either because they have been assimilated through inter-marriage with other ethnic or religious communities, or because they have converted to other religions such as Christianity and Islam.
Family Ties
The Chetti Melaka in Singapore comprise a small community and they have been inter-marrying for several generations. Consequently, many of them are related or at least know each other. Due to its joint family system, the community has always been cohesive and share close relations. Till today, the elders in the family are very much respected, and some of the most important festivals for the community honour deceased ancestors.
The Chetti Melaka are conventionally orthodox with regard to naming practices, and they are given traditional Hindu names at birth. However, the Chetti Melaka also ascribe terms of endearment for all members of the family, and the meanings behind these nick names are known only to those near and dear. Nenek Jambol (grandmother with a special hairdo), Tok Puteh (a very fair lady), Krisna kechi (Krishnan who is short) and Mama Bulat (fat and round uncle) are but a few examples of Chetti nicknames.
As a result of migration, Chetti Melaka families were scattered across Melaka, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and across Malaya. Fortunately, the Chetti Melaka communities in Singapore and Melaka share close and strong bonds. For instance, several Chetti Melaka in Singapore continue to make donations to the temples in Melaka during festivals such as Sembahyang Dato Chachar, thus strengthening the bonds between the two communities.
The Way Forward
Watch: The Way Forward
In spite of being one of the region's oldest communities, little is known about the Chetti Melaka of Singapore. They are a very small community, whose numbers are steadily declining, and their uniquely Straits heritage largely rests in the collective memory of the older members of the community.
Many members of the community, especially amongst the younger generation, have lost touch with their Chetti roots and a general lack of ready information about the heritage of the Chetti Melaka community has caused many of them to distance themselves from with their ancestry. Furthermore, as a result of generations of marriages outside of the community, many families are now unable to trace their Chetti Melaka lineage.
To further exacerbate the situation, the community is also faced with the dilemma of diasporic emigration, with several young Chetti Melaka migrating to Australia, North America, Europe and the United Kingdom. As a result, these emigrant Chetti Melaka are susceptible to newer multicultural influences which further render the contemporary Chetti Melaka identity more complex.
In the face of these challenges, the Peranakan Indian (Chitty Melaka) Association Singapore has played a crucial role in the revival of public interest in the community, and the way forward may lie in more sustained efforts to document and transmit different aspects of Chetti Melaka heritage and to increase public awareness and appreciation of the community's unique language, cuisine and social-cultural practices.

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 2 â€“ Apr to Jun 2011
Aviation history was made on 16 March 1911. On this day, the first aircraft took flight in Singapore, when a Bristol Boxkite biplane piloted by Joseph Christiaens rose into the air from the old Race Course at Farrer Park. It was a flight demonstration at the first aviation meet held in Singapore. To mark the centenary of this historic occasion, the Singapore Philatelic Museum opened an exhibition titled Singapore Takes Flight: A Hundred Years. Running from 11 March till September 2011, this exhibition celebrated the milestone event with picture postcards, postage stamps and first day covers alongside a private collection of model aircraft on loan from Mr Ralph Aeria. An award-winning philatelic collection, Malayan Airmail 1911-1942, from Mr Lim Sa Bee was also displayed from end March to June 2011.
The Bristol aircraft
The Plane and The Pilot
The Bristol Boxkite was a modified version of the Henri Farman biplane, a famous and widely used model produced in France and first flown in 1909. Seating two, the Boxkite was developed by the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, a Bristol-based company that was later renamed the Bristol Aeroplane Company.
The first Boxkite flew on 29 July 1910. It was put into production, in significant numbers for the time, at Britain's first aircraft factory in Filton, Bristol. A highly successful aircraft, the Boxkite soon drew the attention of the British War Office which placed an order for four aircraft. This was followed by orders from the Australian Army, India and Russia. The Boxkite was used extensively as an elementary training aircraft.
In 1964, three Boxkite replicas were built with modern engines by F.G. Miles Engineering Ltd for the Twentieth Century Fox film Those Magnificent Men and their Flying Machines, which was very successful at the box office. An Australian project team, known as Project 2014, has reconstructed the Boxkite to commemorate the centenary of the first military flight in Australia on 1 March 2014.
The pilot of Singapore's virgin flight, Joseph Christiaens, was an engineer, race car driver and aviator born to a well-to-do family near Brussels in Belgium in 1879. In March 1910, Christiaens learned to fly in a Henri Farman airplane and in the following month, was registered with Belgian Pilot License #7, becoming one of the first 11 aviators registered at the Aero Club of Belgium. Thereafter, he took part in a number of aviation meetings racing Henri Farman's plane in Europe in 1910.
In 1911, Joseph Christiaens, with his brother Armaud, made a tour of the East Indies, taking with him two Bristol Boxkite biplanes. An avid car racer, he died on 25 February 1919 in a road accident while testing a racing car in England. His speeding car crashed into a wall while trying to avoid a horse-cart emerging out of a side road.
From Race Course to International Aviation Route
Built in 1842 by members of the Singapore Sporting Club, the old Race Course at Farrer Park served as a sports and recreational hub for European residents. Although the race course moved to new premises in Bukit Timah in 1933, the road name â€œRace Course Roadâ€ continues to serve as a reminder of its early equestrian heritage.
Some early postcards of the Race Course at Farrer Park. The first postcard shows Captain Ross Smith after he landed in Singapore.
Eight years after Christiaens' historic flight in his Boxkite, the Race Course saw action once more when a Vickers Vimy G-EAOU piloted by Captain Ross Smith landed for a stopover on 4 December 1919. Captain Ross had flown 22 days and 13,900 km from England and was en route to Darwin, Northern Australia. He completed his 135-hour journey on 10 December 1919.
Stamps commemorating the first Vickers Vimy flight from England to Australia and the first trans-Atlantic flight.
""I glided the Vimy down at as low a speed as possible, and just before we touched the ground.... The next day, December 4, was my birthday, and to reach Australia within the specified thirty-day time limit meant that we had to arrive in Darwin on the 12th, eight days from now, and four more landings to make after leaving Singapore. Thus it will be seen we still had four days in hand. I therefore decided to remain the whole of next day at Singapore and work on our machine. ... The heat in Singapore was intense and, coming from the cold of the English winter, we felt it severely.""

The beginning of 1930s saw the rapid expansion of air routes connecting Europe to the Far East. The Dutch airline, KLM (the Dutch abbreviation of Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij or Royal Dutch Airlines), placed Alor Star, Singapore and Penang on the international aviation route map in 1931, 1933 and 1936 respectively. Singapore's first direct link with Europe was established on 3 May 1933 when a KLM Fokker F-18 put the island on the trunk route between Amsterdam and Batavia (now Jakarta).
At the end of 1934, Imperial Airways, the first British commercial long-range air transport company, established its England-Australia link with Singapore as a key stopover point. Qantas Empire Airways took over the Singapore-Australia sector in 1935.

After the Second World War, jetliners with greater speed and capacity replaced propeller-driven aircraft. The first jet to arrive in Singapore was a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Comet in 1951. Produced by de Havilland, a British aviation company, the Comet was the world's first commercial jet airliner with a sleek aerodynamic body, pressurised cabin and seating up to 36 passengers. Unfortunately, the plane was unable to land at Kallang Airport due to runway limitations and so landed at the Changi Royal Air Force airfield instead. Airmail was delivered to Singapore for the first time by jet plane in 1951.
From Civil Aerodrome to Changi International Airport
From 1928, small land aircraft and seaplanes were handled at the military airbase of the Royal Air Force at Seletar. Growth in air traffic in the early 1930s, however, prompted the call for a new civilian airport facility. Then Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi expressed on 31 August 1931 his opinion in words that would prove prophetic in the later decades of the century:
""It is a not a question of which aerodrome in Singapore Island would be the cheapest but which aerodrome in Singapore Island would be the best. Looking into the future, I expect to see Singapore become one of the largest and most important airports of the world... It is, therefore, essential that we should have here, close to the heart of town, an aerodrome which is equally suitable for land planes and for sea planes; and the best site, beyond all question, is the Kallang Basin.""
Work on this massive reclamation task began in 1932. Kallang Airport was officially opened by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Thomas Shenton, on 12 June 1937. It was praised as the finest airport in the British Empire.
Regional aviation continue to expand, with the launch of the first internal air service in Malaya, Wearne's Air Service, on 28 June 1937, which flew three times a week from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur and Penang.

Advances in aviation technology after the Second World War led to the development of bigger and faster civil aircraft. The inability of Kallang Airport to accommodate the Comet led to the extension and strengthening of the runway, but it was becoming apparent that a new civil airport was necessary. Construction thus began in 1952 of the Paya Lebar Airport, which was completed on 20 August 1955 and officially opened by then Chief Minister of Singapore, David Marshall, with British Colonial Secretary, Alan Lennox-Boyd, as guest-of-honour.
After independence, Singapore's growing role as an international trading hub and tourism destination led to the construction of Changi International Airport. The first phase, completed in 1981, included a runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, a passenger terminal, a maintenance hangar, a fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, cargo agent buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a 78-metre high control tower. Changi International Airport began operations on 1 July 1981 and was officially opened on 29 December 1981.
The airport later expanded with the addition of Terminal 2 which became operational on 22 November 1990 and was officially opened on 1 June 1991. Further expansion took place in 2008 with the opening of Terminal 3, which was designed to handle the gigantic Airbus A380, on 9 January 2008. The recent boom in budget air travel saw the addition of a separate Budget Terminal which began operations on 26 March 2006. Terminal 4 was also officially opened on 31 October 2017 with self-check-in and automated bag drop facilities. Jewel Changi Airport, a commercial development, and Terminal 5 are due to open in 2019 and the late 2020s respectively.
A Century of Plane Delights
The history of Singapore's national airlines, which began in May 1947, is illustrated in a 2003 Aircraft Stamp Series. The stamps trace the development of our national airlines from Malayan Airways to Singapore Airlines, and their aircraft through the decades, from the light twin-engine Airspeed Consul to modern day Jumbos, Concordes, and Airbuses.
In February 2006, the first Airbus A380 in full Singapore Airlines livery was flown to Singapore. On 25 October the following year, the first commercial A380 service, SQ380, carried 455 passengers from Singapore to Sydney. Regular services with the A380 began on 28 October 2007. Thus, history was made once more as a French-assembled giant soared over Singapore, drawing countless eyes to the sky nearly a century after the first fateful flight by a Belgian in a biplane over the city's former race course.

Man's Quest to Fly
The flight of birds has fascinated mankind for ages. Our quest to soar like the birds had led to many fantasies and inventions that would aid humans to â€˜fly'.
For centuries, humans have tried to fly like birds and studied avian flight. Wings, made of feathers or lightweight wood, were attached to arms to test their ability to take to the air. The results were often disastrous, as the muscles of the human arms are incomparable to those of birds. Kites were important to the invention of flight as they were the forerunners to balloons and gliders. Since 400 BCE, kites have been used by the Chinese in religious ceremonies. In 1000 BCE, the Chinese were reported to have used kites for in warfare, carrying men as spies and dropping firebombs over enemy territory. This practice was witnessed by the Venetian merchant-traveller Marco Polo (1254-1324) in the 1300s when he was in China. There are very reliable records of human attempts to fly until the early medieval times when the so-called tower jumpers appeared in force. Few of these courageous but perhaps misguided men were successful in their flying endeavours and in surviving their feats.
Between 1488 and 1514, the Italian inventor Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) made the first real studies of flight. He left over 100 drawings that illustrated his theories on bird and mechanical flight. The drawings show the wings and tails of birds, ideas for human-carrying machines, and devices for the testing of wings.
The Ornithopter, a flying machine drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, was designed to be powered by a combination of leg and arm movements activated by mean of mechanical devices. The machine was never actually created.
Leonardo da Vinci soon learned to imitate the way birds glide rather than use human-powered wing motion. He designed and built winged gliders for human use.
The 18th century saw the emergence of hot air balloons with proponents like the Montgolfier brothers, Joseph-Michel (1740-1810) and Jacques-Ã‰tienne (1745-1799). The French siblings used smoke from a fire to blow hot air into a silk bag, which was then attached to a basket. The Montgolfiers first sent people up in hot air balloons with a manned flight on 21 November 1783.
English engineer, Sir George Cayley (1773â€“ 1857), is considered the father of aerodynamics, which is the study of the movement of objects through the air. In 1804, he built the world's first successful model glider which was successfully flown by a young boy. In 1853, Cayley reshaped the glider's wing and added a tail to help with the stability.
The German Otto Lilienthal (1848-1896) made the first true controlled flights, gliding up to a distance of 230 metres. He experimented with various monoplane and biplane gliders which resembled giant bats. After more than 2,500 flights, Lilienthal was killed when he lost control during a sudden strong gust of wind and crashed into the ground.
The American Wright Brothers, Wilbur and Orville, constructed the first powered airplane, the â€˜Flyer', in the summer of 1903. Piloted by Wilbur, the Flyer attempted its maiden flight on 14 December 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, USA. This attempt was not successful. The brothers tried again three days later. This time piloted by Orville, the Flyer lifted itself into the air at 10.35 am. Although the flight lasted only 12 seconds and covered a distance of just 37 metres, it was the first self-powered, manned, heavier-than-air controlled flight in history.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-first-resident/the-first-resident,"Most Singaporeans know that Major-General William Farquhar was with Sir Stamford Raffles when he arrived in Singapore, and that he was the one who stayed to oversee the newly established trading settlement in 1819. However, beyond sweeping statements in history textbooks, the details of his contributions to Singapore remain unclear, and a mystery to many.
Learn more about Farquhar, the main man responsible for building up the entrepot in its early years.
Farquhar's career
Major-General William Farquhar was an employee of the East India Company from the age of 17 and became a lieutenant in the Madras Engineers at 19. He was Chief Engineer in the expeditionary force which took Malacca from the Dutch in 1795. He was officially appointed Resident and Commandant of Malacca in 1813, which earned him his reputation for reliability and trustworthiness. His fluent Malay and knowledge of local customs also made him a popular and well-respected figure.
Farquhar was present at the meeting with Temenggong Abdul Rahman in Singapore, and the signings of the very first provisional agreement on 30th January 1819 and the Singapore Treaty on 6th February 1819 â€“ the first historical step towards establishing the port on the island.
Raffles appointed him Resident and Commandant of Singapore, and left him with the responsibility of establishing the trading settlement. Going beyond official documents, it has been said that Raffles was the visionary while Farquhar was the man of action, carrying out the practical, day-to-day tasks to turn ideas into reality.
Building up Singapore from 1819
Affectionately known as the â€œRajah of Malaccaâ€, Farquhar was well-loved by many and word of his new role in Singapore caused an exodus of merchants from Malacca to settle in Singapore instead. The population grew and the port conducted 8 million Spanish dollars of trade under Farquhar's watch. However, this did not come without a price.
Farquhar had adopted measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles' instructions, such as allowing the erection of houses and godowns on the Padang, as well as on the nearby banks of the Singapore River. His pragmatism even went as far as permitting gambling and slavery.
This photograph of shophouses, godowns and â€˜twakow' lighter vessels along the banks of the Singapore River comes from the album of Sergeant B.W. Turner of the 1/4th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry. (c. 1915. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Raffles held on to lofty goals for Singapore such as education, urban planning, and the enforcement of law and order, while aiming to resolve issues such as slavery, piracy and friction among immigrant groups. However, the reality was far from ideal as Farquhar took a more permissive approach in his leadership. He made do with the resources he had to ensure the port's survival â€“ even if the plans deviated from Raffles' specific directions.
Farquhar's dismissal from Singapore
When Raffles returned to Singapore in 1823, he was furious to find out that his plans had been neglected, and that local vices such as trading of opium and slaves were being tolerated. Farquhar was effectively dismissed and he was succeeded as British Resident by Dr John Crawfurd.
When Farquhar left Singapore at the end of 1823, he was accompanied to the beach by an outpouring of tributes from Singapore's multi-ethnic community. A farewell salute was given, accompanied by some Siamese vessels firing their guns in his honour. Local boats escorted him to his main ship, the Alexander, while it sailed away.
This silver epergne was presented to William Farquhar, the first British Resident of Singapore. It was a parting gift from the Chinese community when he left the island in 1823. The epergne was an ornamental centre piece for the table. (c. 1824. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
The silver epergne that the Chinese community presented to Farquhar as a parting gift is on display at the National Museum of Singapore.
William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings
Farquhar supervised the planting of cloves and nutmeg at the bottom of Fort Canning Hill. Beyond the botanical realm, he was also involved in the discovery and identification of several indigenous species, such as the Malayan tapir. He even kept one as a pet.
Another legacy of William Farquhar is the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings. This collection provides us with a tangible record of the rich biodiversity of the Malay Peninsula in the 19th century.
This painting of the nutmeg plant was commissioned by William Farquhar and belongs to the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings. (c. 1810. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Consisting of 477 watercolours of plants and animals, the entire collection was commissioned by Farquhar and drawn by Chinese artists. Besides their artistic value, the paintings also hold scientific importance. The depictions of the plants and animals are detailed, and are all accompanied by their scientific and/or common names in Malay or English. With this passion for natural history, it is fitting that the wild nutmeg (gymacranthera farquhariana) is named after him.
For his contributions to the founding of modern Singapore and the early years of its development, Farquhar has an important place in Singapore's history.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/sit-houses-along-serangoon-road/story,"Text by Clement Liew
MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 â€“ June 2017
There are many stories of Serangoon Road which tell of the people, trades and festivities that make Little India an interesting and exciting place for locals and tourists to visit. Yet, there's still plenty waiting to be discovered. Some of the following accounts will not only shed light on some of the realities that we see along the streets of Serangoon Road today, but also enrich our knowledge of how Little India came to be. One of these historical nuggets is the district's forgotten urban heritage which is an integral part of Singapore's urban redevelopment and nation building story. It was during the 1920s that government quarters were built within parts of Little India to form small housing estates. It was around these population clusters that various ethnic communities began to put down their roots and create places which they would later call home.
Homes for Government Workers â€“ The Genesis of a Community
Today, there are several abandoned long blocks of terrace houses along Hindoo Road. They were once part of a cluster of residences that the government used to house labourers under its employ, many of whom were Indians. Starting from around 1920, the government started building such quarters in the area bounded by Upper Weld Road, Jalan Besar, Rowell Road and Kampong Kapor Road.
These terrace houses were built in the 1920s at the junction of Chitty and Kampong Kapor Roads, c. 1966.

Looking at the layout of this area, it is clear that a planned housing estate had been created in the heart of Kampong Kapor. It had two playgrounds for residents which were situated on opposite ends along Kampong Kapor Road.

The provision of these play fields highlighted the nature of the arrangements made for this municipal town, which was meant to include family units. These quarters were not just large rooms that housed numerous coolies, but they also had quarters for married men with families. Clearly, this reflected how principles of modern town planning were applied here. Beyond concerns that open areas were necessary for clear air and healthy living, the planting of a domiciled community which included family units in the district provided a community catchment that could sustain the business and social-communal institutions rooted in Serangoon Road.
This row of terrace houses at Upper Weld Road, built in the 1920s, was also called ""Coolie Lines"", c. 1966.

What is astonishing about this development is that the construction of Kampong Kapor estate was undertaken by the municipality even before the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT), the colonial predecessor of the Housing & Development Board (HDB), had been empowered to erect pioneering townships. For this reason, the houses here were then called Municipal Quarters.
These terrace houses were home to many Indian municipal workers, c. 1966.

Initially, municipal planners had only intended for these houses to accommodate government coolies and peons. However, by the time construction began, coolie lodgings were being developed into full-fledged housing estates.
After World War II (WWII), during the time of the British Military Administration, authorities established a temporary municipal market for this community at the site of the playground on Rowell Road. As one side of these grounds ran along the length of Hindoo Road, it was called the Hindoo Road Market. For a period of two years, it served the needs of the residents of this estate. It was closed in 1948.
In addition to Kampong Kapor, another cluster of government housing was built in 1927 on the grounds of Kandang Kerbau Hospital, on the side of Kampong Java Road. These houses were established for hospital staff, as well as government employees who were above the labouring class. These were known as Government Quarters.
Terrace houses at the junction of Veerasamy and Kampong Kapor Roads, built in the 1920s. The compound was enclosed with an external wall during the post-war years, creating a garden space for each unit, c. 1966.

Half a dozen blocks of flats were also erected at Race Course Road in 1940, at the junction of Rotan Lane. They consisted of 148 apartment units. This was the first SIT project in Serangoon Road. The Race Course Road flats were used to house artisans and other municipal staff, including hospital nurses. However, these flats did not survive the decade. By 1950, they were levelled and replaced by more than a dozen new SIT flats which stretched the entire length of the Farrer Park Field. This estate was named Princess Elizabeth Flats, and is not to be mistaken for the Princess Elizabeth Park Estate at Upper Bukit Timah Road.
Both Princess Elizabeth estates, however, shared similar beginnings. They were created with funds which were originally meant for celebrating the marriage of Princess Elizabeth. These funds were eventually donated to the municipality which then assigned them for public housing purposes. The flats at Race Course Road were occasionally inundated by flood waters during heavy downpours.
There was also a unique cluster of SIT flats, which sat at the junction of Campbell Lane (known today as Madras Road). Here, SIT managed to squeeze in several blocks of flats consisting of 24 houses. These were built in 1941, not as part of a housing estate, but to replace individual blocks of houses in the area that had become dilapidated and which required rebuilding. Today, only one block remains. It currently functions as the Madras Hotel.
Construction of SIT flats took a pause during WWII, but continued unabated soon after. The Princess Elizabeth Flats estate was extended to the other end of Farrer Park to form Farrer Park Estate. Around the same time, another SIT estate was also being built towards the Lavender Street side of Serangoon Road. These were the SIT flats of Petain Road which would later become known as Jalan Besar Estate. These flats have since given way to private developments.
Urban Development over the Years
What is interesting about the Little India public housing experience is that the district featured almost all the models of flats built during colonial times â€“ from pre-SIT 1920s municipal quarters (terrace houses) at Hindoo Road to the subsequent generations of SIT flats that the government would go on to build. The first ones were no more than two levels high. Then, during the 1940s, SIT increased the height of these flats to three storeys, and by the 1950s, the flats built at Jalan Besar Estate, along Petain and Sturdee Roads, reached up to four storeys in height.

A four-storey SIT flat at the junction of Petain and Sturdee Roads. These were the last SIT flats built along Serangoon Road, c. 1966.

The evolutionary progression of Little India's urban development is worth noting. While terrace houses of the 1920s were built with internal staircases, the design of the 1940s SIT flats had evolved towards a more community-centric approach, featuring elements such as shared staircases. By the 1950s, the modern two and four-storey SIT flats at Jalan Besar Estate were being built with common corridors in the front, as well as staircases on both ends of the blocks.
At the junction of Petain and Marne Roads, there was a curious evolving design of a terrace-like housing block with a five-footway which went all around the ground level. This was a perfect example of the transition between the design of the old quarters and modern new flats. The five-footway, in this instance, was the first step towards the creation of common corridors in government housing. This preceded the coming evolutionary cycle of public flats in the 1960s and 70s, where the hanging of laundry poles moved from the front corridors towards the back of the flat.

Communities and Enclaves
In an area covered by abattoirs, factories, shophouses and warehouses, the municipal and government quarters, as well as SIT flats, acted as crucial population centres which gave the Serangoon Road district the semblance of a kampong (Malay for ""village"") of multi-ethnic domiciled communities. This is the reason why such a great diversity of communal and religious institutions remains in the district till this day. Edifices sprouted all over Serangoon Road because the communities they served were also here.
Without these institutions and communities, this part of Serangoon Road would simply have evolved into an industrial and commercial district, and not the Little India that we know today. The flats in Serangoon Road helped to sustain the community, made up of businesses, schools, hospitals, religious institutions, as well as market and street stalls.

There's much to be learnt from Serangoon Road's forgotten urban heritage. In documenting the building of government quarters in the district across the years, one can truly appreciate the thinking and logic of Singapore's early planners and builders. Perhaps, the Serangoon Road urban experience serves as a microcosm of how public housing has evolved throughout Singapore's historical districts. With this aspect of Singapore's social-urban history being rediscovered, we can now add to our understanding of Little India and Singapore's urban heritage.

Though much of this urban heritage may have vanished from Little India, memories of these spaces may still be recovered through archival research and new oral enquiries. There are also still a few remaining housing edifices at Hindoo Road and Madras Street, where you can appreciate how pockets of housing within Little India had once been the heartland for many of Singapore's labouring pioneers.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 1 â€“ Jan to Mar 2014
If you think stamps are boring â€“ here's an exhibition that will not only change the way you look at â€“ but smell, hear, touch, and yes â€“ taste them.
But first, a little history: Postage stamps were introduced by Englishman, Sir Rowland Hill, in 1840 as a form of prepayment for postal delivery service. It was one of the most important inventions of the 19th century as stamps provided a cheap means of sending letters and paved the way for mass communication. Since then, the role of postage stamps has evolved. Stamps today are used to document a country's historical milestones, achievements, aspirations, arts, culture, and biodiversity. The wealth of information encapsulated in these miniature pieces of art are collected and studied as a hobby by many.
In today's IT age, postal communication remains vital, especially with the popularity of internet shopping. In the spirit of innovation, philately â€“ the study of stamps and postal history â€“ has kept up with the times. Postal authorities court buyers by using technological advancements to produce dazzling arrays of stamps; advanced printing technology and innovative printing techniques allow stamp designers to express their creativity. Much to the delight of users and collectors, some stamps these days are designed and printed on non-paper materials and incorporated with interesting and quirky features that bring out their beauty.
Some of these were on display at the Singapore Philatelic Museum in 2014 â€“ many for the first time. Spanning over 47 years of collection, the exhibition which featured more than 300 unique stamps not only bucked traditional expectations that stamps are always and only printed on paper â€“ they even tickle one's senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch!
It is simply a visual treat to see stamps bejewelled with precious stones like diamond, crystal and gem; and precious metals like gold, silver and bronze.
Swarovski Crystals, Austria, 2008.
Exhibit from Singapore Philatelic Museum Collection.
There are also stamps that are made of unusual materials such as lace, cork, wood, and embedded with real pearl, sea salt and volcanic ash. Some can even glow in the dark or feature 3-D moving images, while others smell of coffee, chocolate, fruits and flowers.
If this is not fascinating enough, there are even talking stamps that narrate poems and play folk songs, and DVD stamps that show videos of the country. To top it all, there are stamps that taste of the food they depict when being licked!
Precious Stone
Special techniques and glues are used to affix diamonds and crystals onto the stamps. These precious stones must be firmly and securely adhered to the stamps to survive the postal system if they are used on mail.

Precious Metal
Genuine 22- and 24-carat gold, silver, bronze and platinum are some of the precious metals used to produce some of the stamps on display. They are either in the form of solid metal similar to ingots, or in the form of foils that are pressed onto the printed stamp surfaces using a combination of heat and pressure.

On 15 February 1942, Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival and three other officers walked to the Ford Factory. At the factory, they met with General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the Japanese Imperial Army to sign the surrender document.

Located in Upper Bukit Timah Road, the factory was Ford's first motorcar assembly plant in Southeast Asia, completed just the year before. General Yamashita took over the premise and turned it into a Japanese headquarters, where he awaited Lieutenant-General Percival's arrival on the morning of 15 February 1942. The factory formed the setting for the British surrender, which marked the start of the Japanese Occupation that lasted three years and seven months.
Today, the Ford Factory is one of Singapore's national monuments. These national monuments are gazetted for their architectural and historic significance. While Singapore's monuments are in pristine condition today, they too have witnessed the country's darker moments as Syonan-to.
This article looks at a number of monuments where wartime events took place at different stages of Singapore's history as Syonan-to, and how they now serve as landmarks of memories in the country's ever-changing landscape.
Lead-up to the fall of Singapore
Just two months before the fall of Singapore, the Japanese struck seven locations in the Asia-Pacific region during the wee hours of 8 December 1941, including Singapore. Maurice Baker, who was a student at the Raffles College then, recalled that he was awakened in his hostel by bomb explosions, anti-aircraft guns and sirens from the air-raid alarm. Shortly thereafter, he and his classmates received news from his principal, Professor of History W. E. Dyer, that war in the Pacific had started and Japanese airplanes would strike again. Notwithstanding the grim future, Professor Dyer urged his students to act with great compassion towards the less fortunate. Together, they organised the Raffles College Medical Auxiliary Service, bringing medical volunteers to serve in disaster areas while the college became a makeshift hospital for the wounded.
Raffles College was one of the buildings that were used for new purposes during wartime to serve people in that time of need, and Professor Dyer's spirit of compassion was echoed elsewhere. As air raids intensified and soldiers started retreating from Malaya into Singapore, several other makeshift hospitals emerged to help existing hospitals cope with the increasing number of wounded. Such makeshift hospitals in the city included the St Andrew's Cathedral, Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall and the St Joseph's Institution. While these buildings were not designed to house hospital beds and operating theatres, the medical volunteers made do with the spaces and replaced the existing furniture, swiftly transforming them into hospitals. Today, although pews have long since replaced the beds at St Andrew's Cathedral, history is memorialised in the plaques dedicated to servicemen who perished in the Second World War, as well as the First. The extension of the church's north transept in 1952 also became known as the War Memorial Wing.
Nearby, one of Singapore's biggest pre-war structures, the Municipal Building (the former City Hall), took in people who needed shelter from the ongoing air raids8. Constructed between 1926 and 1929, the building was designed with a long frontage made up of 18 colossal columns. This was to reflect the colonial rule's strength and the Municipal Council's important functions, which had expanded significantly in the 1920s. During air raids, the building's large size and thick walls could provide people with adequate protection from the blasts. The Municipal Council recognised this, and also created additional shelter for another 150 people within the building by cutting into the rear of the building's main stairway facing St Andrew's Road.
People also sought shelter and solace in places of worship amid the chaos. These places provided both spiritual help and physical protection to the people, who held on to the hope that Japanese troops would not wreak havoc in these religious places and they would hence be safe. In fact, Japanese troops did receive instructions to leave religious organisations alone. In Kampong Glam, people who lived in villages around the Sultan Mosque â€“ both Malays and non-Malays â€“ fled to the mosque during air raids and prayed for safety there. Venerable Pu Liang opened the doors of Siong Lim Monastery in Toa Payoh, the largest monastery in Singapore and Malaya at that time, to people living in the vicinity during air raids. Likewise, Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church also served as a medical centre and bomb shelter. Its exterior walls facing the street were thickened and reinforced to prevent shrapnel from penetrating the church, providing protection to the wounded and others hiding there. In addition, it had a trapdoor located in its social hall, leading to a hideout where British soldiers hid when they tried to escape from Japanese troops.

Some places of worship, however, could not escape the damage and harm caused by war. For instance, the Sultan Mosque was not always trouble-free. A bomb had fallen into its compound during an air raid, damaging one of its ancillary buildings.

Although the Japanese troops had been instructed to leave religious organisations alone, they still entered Siong Lim Monastery to capture Venerable Pu Liang and a few of his disciples in 1942, for they were keen supporters of the anti-Japanese resistance movement. Venerable Pu Liang, who came to Singapore in 1921, condemned the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and fiercely supported the anti-Japanese movement. In the late-1930s, he donated Siong Lim Monastery's Vesak Day monetary collection to the China Relief Fund. As the monastery's premises were huge and Japanese troops were not supposed to enter this place of worship, anti-Japanese groups had secretly conducted trainings in the monastery. Specifically, Venerable Pu Liang permitted Allied troops to train their pilots and technicians there. He also allowed a training centre to be set up to train drivers and mechanics to ply the treacherous Burma Road into China, so as to maintain supplies for the Chinese troops. His support for the anti-Japanese movement was too great for the Japanese to ignore, resulting in his arrest in 1942.
On the morning of 15 February 1942, Lieutenant-General Percival and other Anglicans attended communion service at St Andrew's Cathedral before he surrendered Singapore to the Japanese. The cathedral remained open for service throughout the Japanese Occupation, and its membership grew with more converts in that period.
Years of fear: 16 February 1942 â€“ 12 September 1945
While people in Singapore created new purposes for existing buildings to protect lives, the Japanese occupied some of the country's key buildings and converted them into spaces that evoked public fear. The kempeitai (military police) were housed in these buildings to keep a close watch on the people. For instance, the Hill Street Police Station built between 1934 and 1936 as a police station and barracks for the police force to ensure order in Singapore, became one of the kempeitai offices where the military police committed atrocities and tortured their victims.
The Japanese also used the former Cathay Building, which opened as Singapore's first air-conditioned cinema in 1939, as an outlet for Japanese propaganda. Japanese movies and propaganda films were screened in the theatres, with rare treats of German and Italian films. As the building was designed to house offices and apartments, it was a suitable venue for the Japanese Propaganda Department, which was also the media centre for all newspapers in Singapore and Malaya. Given its prime location as a cinema which attracted movie-goers, Cathay Building and its surroundings became a good spot for the Japanese to display severed heads of looters and thieves to strike fear in people.
Cathay building
Rudy Mosbergen, a 13-year-old student then, was one witness of this gory scene:
""As a little boy I heard some people talking down there, they said, you know if you go to Cathay Building, there is a head chopped off. I went down to Bras Basah Road, next to Hotel Rendezvous now. And from there I could see, I looked across next to the Cathay Building, there was a table and that fellow's head was there.""
Education was disrupted. Schools were either shut down or became tools of propaganda for the Japanese. Raffles College, one of the two tertiary institutions at that time, became a medical facility and later the headquarters of the Japanese military. Chinese schools such as Tao Nan School (which houses the Peranakan Museum today) stopped functioning during the Japanese Occupation. They were targeted by the Japanese as they had supported the anti-Japanese movement, and the premises were occupied by the Japanese army. Ng Kim Hua, a student of Tao Nan School then, recounted that the Nationalists had visited Chinese schools in Singapore to recruit young men for China's battle against the Japanese. Lin Shiping, who taught at Tao Nan School from 1939 to 1942, shared that several teachers went into hiding after the Japanese occupied Singapore in 1942. His colleagues, Wang Zhixue and Xue Fanglun, were caught and killed.

English schools such as St Joseph's Institution, on the other hand, were more fortunate. They were allowed to continue functioning to serve the needs of the Japanese. St Joseph's Institution reopened as the Bras Basah Boys' School after serving as the Red Cross Hospital. The students' daily tasks, however, included growing crops in the green space in front of the school during lesson time, so as to support the â€œGrow Your Own Food Campaignâ€. The Japanese implemented this self-sustaining policy as food was becoming increasingly scarce.

The Japanese Surrender and Singapore's Independence 20 Years Thereafter
The difficult lives experienced by people during the Japanese Occupation finally ended on 12 September 1945 with the Japanese surrender and the end of the Second World War. While Ford Factory witnessed the beginning of the Japanese Occupation on 15 February 1942, the Municipal Building celebrated its end on 12 September 1945. This joyous occasion was widely reported in The Straits Times, marking the paper's revival after it stopped operating on 15 February 1942. People gathered around the Municipal Building to witness the Japanese's march to surrender.
Spectators planted themselves at vantage points â€“ including the base of the dome of the former Supreme Court and the roof of the Municipal Building â€“ to witness this historic moment. The Straits Times report, â€œJapanese in Malaysia Surrender at Singaporeâ€ dated 13 September 19452, described this momentous event:
""All vantage points had their large or small groups of spectators. Any roof within was packed with Chinese, Malays and Indians determined to see this historic ceremony.""
""Scene of so many important civic meetings which had produced decisions leading to the great development of Singapore in the old era, the Municipal Council chamber yesterday became a stage for a drama of the greatest historical importance.""
This important event began with a formal ceremony at the Padang, followed by the solemn proceedings in the surrender chamber. Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia, inspected the parade at the Padang.

Mosquito bombersâ€ â€“ British combat aircrafts â€“ flew over in salute, big Sunderland flying boats used in long-range reconnaissance and bombing missions droned over, which were then followed by Dakota transports. The Japanese representatives arrived shortly thereafter and proceeded to the Municipal Building where they waited to sign the surrender document, witnessed by several individuals including the Sultan of Johore. He shared:
""I have never before been so stirred. I am glad to have been there to watch these fellows sign. I am proud to have had the honour of witnessing their formal surrender.""
In a matter of nine minutes, the Japanese officially surrendered, and the surrender was publicly declared by Lord Louis Mountbatten on the steps of the Municipal Building.

Twenty years later in 1965, then-Premier Lee Kuan Yew broke the news of Singapore's separation from Malaysia to some heads of consulates and key civil servants in the City Hall building (renamed from Municipal Building in 1951).
The Municipal Building has thus witnessed Singapore's transformation from colonial rule, to subjugation to the Japanese, to independence.
Remembering: Monuments and Memories
Many years on, people's bravery and actions are remembered through stories and memorials. For instance, the iconic block with the clock tower of the Singapore General Hospital was renamed Bowyer Block in memory of John Herbert Bowyer, Chief Medical Officer of the Outram Road General Hospital. Bowyer died in Sime Road Internment Camp during the Japanese Occupation on 1 November 1944. Also, just across the Padang facing the Municipal Building stand two memorials. One is the Cenotaph, built to commemorate the war dead; while the other is the Lim Bo Seng Memorial to honour an individual.
Two of the Esplanade Memorials - Cenotaph and Lim Bo Seng Memorial - reminding us of the sacrifices made by individuals.

The Cenotaph, unveiled on 31 March 1922 by the Prince of Wales, was erected in honour of the 124 men from Singapore who died in action during World War I. A second dedication was made between 1950 and 1951 to those who died during World War II. Unlike the first dedication, the second did not have any names because the number of war dead was overwhelming. Instead, the message â€œThey died so we might liveâ€ was inscribed.
Just beside the Cenotaph, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial was dedicated to Lim Bo Seng, a man who assumed leadership for anti-Japanese activities during the Second World War. Unfortunately, he perished on 29 June 1944 following his capture by the Japanese at a road checkpoint. The construction of the memorial faced much challenges as the plans for the memorial were rejected at least five times by the government. Under the Memorial Committee's perseverance, it was finally constructed and unveiled on 29 June 1954, a decade after Lim's passing. The committee persisted probably because it wanted future generations to know and remember the story of Lim, who could also represent other unnamed individuals who had sacrificed themselves for Singapore's freedom.

On January 23, 1931, twenty-five year old Ng Chen committed suicide. He was a laksa hawker living in Duxton Road. On hearing of this tragic incident, Seow Poh Leng, a concerned citizen, wrote an eight stanza poem in his article, â€œThe Hapless Hawker: A Plea for Humane Treatmentâ€1. Making no claims to its literary merit, Seow hoped that his verse would â€œinvoke the sympathy of the powers-that-be and of the public for voiceless, illiterate and the much-maligned Hawkers.â€ First printed in the Malaya Tribune, the article is included in the Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Hawker Question in Singapore, 1931 (hereafter referred to as Report):
""We came from Cathay, the land of ancient renown
To try and earn a living in this far-famed modern town
Though father and mother are old they still have to toil each day
My father selling bean-curds, mother selling â€œkwayâ€ [sic]
.....
Good-bye my parents dear, good bye my kith and kin!
Think not the step I take an unpardonable sin
I've not forgotten the lesson of filial piety' . . .
Rather than become a criminal and sully the family name
I drink this potion dark and prefer even death to shame.""

In the early 1900s, a cup of coffee with milk cost two cents on the street and three cents in a coffee shop. Satay sold on the five-foot way was about two cents a stick, and a bowl of Hokkien mee was ten cents. Every cent mattered then, because in 1908, a coolie earned about fifty cents and a rickshaw puller about two dollars a day. Rents for a cubicle on Sago Lane ranged from one and a half to four and a half dollars a month2. In the 1920s, with a capital of fifty cents, one could make about twenty cents3. But this money was hardly enough and by the 1930s, with the depression, the plight of the street hawkers was bad. For instance, in 1935, Liew Ah Chow was in distress as he could not afford medical treatment for his daughter. As a cobbler, he made about thirty to forty cents a day. On this money, he could not afford the ten dollars that the General Hospital charged as medical fees.
Documents such as the Report show the ways in which the administrators viewed the hawkers â€“ as a problem that needed to be addressed. It appears that the main objections to the hawkers, especially the food vendors, were that they caused health problems through serving contaminated food, littered streets, obstructed traffic, posed unfair competition to shop keepers, corrupted the lower ranks of the Police and Municipality and were suspected to having connections with the Secret Societies.
The authors of the Report recognised that the hawkers were essential and that it was a means of livelihood, especially for the new immigrants4. They helped to distribute goods including fruits and vegetables for the retailers and provided cheap and efficient services. So, according to them, a total abolishing of these hawkers was not ideal, but it was important to reduce their numbers, keep them off the main streets and house them in dedicated shelters. Thus their recommendations involved controlling, regulating and monitoring the hawkers. One of the chief ways of doing this was through issuing of licenses.
The first proposal to license and set aside designated places for peddlers to hawk their wares was made in 1903 and it was at the behest of the Chinese Protectorate and the Municipality. The reason for this was that the Police found the hawkers a nuisance and an obstruction on the streets. In 1905 the Municipal Commissioner suggested that food hawkers must be registered. Following this, a series of regulations were instituted. This included licensing of Eating Shops and Coffee Houses in 1913 and the itinerant hawkers both by day and night in 1919.
Itinerant hawker's license no. 6017, issued to Yeo Jeah Siang, 1948.
The three institutions that were involved in â€˜solving' the hawker issues were: Police, the Municipality and the Health Officers. While the Health officers made stringent demands, the Police penalised offenders by seizing their goods and paraphernalia. Not all the rules were successful. Many stallholders who could not meet the health standards closed their shops. As a result, there was an increase in food hawkers on the streets. In 1931, at the time the Report was made, there were 6,043 licensed itinerant hawkers and an estimated 4000 unlicensed ones on the streets. There were six shelters housing 383 hawkers.

The colonial Report reveals the attitudes of the local elites and citizens such as Seow Poh Leng mentioned above. Included are the opinions of the members of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Teochew guilds, and the Straits Chinese British Association among others. While some favoured and sympathised with the hawkers and questioned the efficacy of licensing, others demanded that the hawkers be removed.
Note for instance the opinion of R. Krishnan, editor of The Indian and representing The Indian Association5. He wanted the Indian ice-water seller off the streets. â€œI have no sympathy for him,â€ he says. â€œIf he cannot be removed instantaneously, there should at least be a policy aiming at a quick abolition of this kind of hawkers. . . . Get hold of any ice-water hawker and inspect his fingers. And what do we see? Inflammation of his nail beds and not infrequently pus exuding from them... And it is with such fingers that he prepares his syrups or produces â€œice-ballsâ€ for innocent school children! Again he is the root cause of the dental caries and gastric disturbances of the school going children in Singapore at least that is the strong feeling of Indian parents.â€
Krishnan does not spare the tea and ginger bun sellers, curry puff sellers, vendors of agar-agar or the curd sellers, all of whom belonged to various Indian communities. This perception that the food preparer and seller is an agent of disease is unequivocally established in a language of modernity6. If it resembles the attitude of the colonial administrator, it is not a co-incidence. His fear of contamination is not restricted to the seller but to the consumer as well. In a language that reads like a public health nightmare, he writes of the practice of eating off the same plate, â€œIncidentally the habit of eating off the same dish or plate, as a â€œsatayâ€ sellers' table or at a Chinese stall contributes to the speedy spread of infections from one mouth to the other . . . that dreadful disease, syphilis, will easily, once the infection is passed, go the rounds by this means.â€
In contrast to this negative perception, the itinerant traveller and photographers cast the street peddler as an exotic being. Moving the peddler out of the street and into the studio, the photographer posed him with the tools of his trade. Although removed from the grit and grind of labour, the hawker is presented as an embodiment of work. The picturesque effect becomes even more pronounced in the commercial prints and postcards that began to be produced for bourgeoisie consumption.
If the colonial photographer sought to romanticise the hawker, the adventure seeker was not far behind. In a 1931 account, a street barber is described in the following manner, â€œThe barbers sit along the sidewalks, and in addition to shaving your face, a barber scrapes your tongue, and the same water is used over and over again. He also, with funny little instruments, cleans your eyes, ears and noseâ€7. These remarks are revealing. Despite the fascination of the Orient, the traveller cannot help but reveal his own deep-seated cultural attitude to dirt and hygiene.

Who were the street peddlers? What became of them? These questions might never be fully answered as there are no first person accounts available. There are various types of sources that explore the economic and social conditions of street life in the late 19th and early 20th century. Among them are histories of the working class, accounts left behind by travellers, and colonial records. Following the classic 1963 study by the anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, economists and city planners began to take notice of street traders8. Economists have examined street hawkers in urban cities such as Hong Kong and Jakarta among others9.
The studies of Singapore's street peddlers, especially food vendors, have to be located in the corpus of this larger discourse10. Visual records such as drawings, illustrations and fictional representations of the working class can also be considered. For instance, classic studies such as Samuel Victor Contant's 1936 work Calls, Sounds and Merchandise of the Peking Street Peddlers is a wonderful study which analyses the language the hawkers' use and carries charming coloured drawings.
The well-known novel, Rickshaw (Lo-T'O Hsiang Tzu), set in Shanghai in the turn of the century, offers a compelling portrait of misery and destitution of street workers and their lives11. However, such an account of Singapore's street people in the early 20th century is yet to be written. Still, there exists, in the National Museum collections, a wealth of materials including photographs, postcards and some associated material culture such as tools and objects.
Peddling of goods and services in the late 19th and early 20th century was tied to migration and kinship networks. Predominant among the street hawkers were the Chinese, Indians, Malays and some Jews. The Chinese were identified largely by their dialect groups included the Cantonese Hockchias, Hockchius, Hokkiens, Shanghainese and Teochews among others. They sold coffee, cooked food, fresh produce, fish, and meats such as pork. Among the Cantonese, there were also women who took to peddling goods, toys, and cigarettes. The Shanghainese sold silk.
Peddlers from the Indian communities sold bread, fried snacks, yoghurt, milk and iced-water.

Among the people of the Malay Archipelago, the Javanese peddled curios and cloth, while the Malays sold satay. Although the hawkers could be found all over the town as some of were itinerant, many of them operated in the central areas. These areas specified by the municipal authorities included largely the southeast part of the island around the Singapore River. The hawkers tended to work along common dialect or language groups.
For instance the Hokkiens who were the largest group of Chinese hawkers could be found everywhere especially around China Street, Hokkien Street and Telok Ayer Street. That they mostly operated in the municipal areas became a major sore point with the colonial administrators.
Chinese Street, Singapore
The exhibition, Surviving the Streets: Peddlers and Artisans in Early-Mid 20th Century Singapore, was about these people who made a living on the streets and five-foot ways. Their lives on the streets highlighted not only disparities between class and race but also the conflicting perceptions between the colonial government and the people. However, through their day to day economic transactions, these individuals forged lasting relationships among themselves and with the spaces in which they operated. That is, the exhibition attempted to define peddlers as not just producers of work. Instead through a selection of artefacts including tools and images of leisure, the display hoped to show that the street vendors were social beings who transformed the world they inhabited in meaningful ways
Surviving the Streets: Peddlers and Artisans in Early-Mid 20th Century Singapore was an exhibition curated by the author. It was on at the Balcony, National Museum of Singapore from 28 June to 22 August 2010. More than a hundred artefacts drawn from the National Museum's collections were displayed along five themes: The Street and the Image, Artisans and Tools, Postcards and Peddlers, Services, Leisure and Social Life. Three video footages of craftsmen, two audio clips of interviews and a selection of folk songs were also included in the display.

A dive for sea cucumbers. A mound sighted. An accidental and amazing discovery was made.
Lying silent for more than a millennium underwater, a chance discovery by local fishermen in 1998 brought the Belitung cargo to light. The wreck was found in relatively shallow waters at a site approximately 17 metres deep and a few kilometres off the shores of Belitung Island in the Java Sea. Tragedy probably struck when the ship crashed into reefs in the area, referred to as Batu Hitam (â€˜black rock').
Authorised by the Indonesia government, salvagers proceeded to recover some 60,000 objects from the wreck site over two seasons of excavation work. The bulk of the finds were Chinese ceramics from the Tang period (618 â€“ 907), comprising both mass produced and rare examples. Bullion in the form of silver and lead ingots was also found. The most astonishing finds were perhaps the exquisite pieces of Chinese metalwork â€“ gold, silver, and bronze â€“ which suggested that the people on board had a connection with the highest strata of Tang society.

The extraordinary nature of this find was heightened by the vessel itself. Examination of the ship's construction methods and analysis of its timbers revealed that the ship was most likely to be of Arab origin. The ship's hull were formed by planks sewn together using vegetal fibres instead of iron fastenings, the latter a feature of Chinese ships. The timbers, consisting of African hardwoods, were common materials used by shipbuilders from the Gulf region. Thus, this shipwreck stands as the earliest Arab vessel to have been discovered in Southeast Asian waters, a testament to the bustling maritime trade and sprawling commercial networks during the ninth century.
Maritime trade routes during the ninth century.
Yet, much remains a mystery. Just as the ship's exact place of origin is undetermined, so is its final point of departure. It was probably Yangzhou (in Jiangsu province) or Guangzhou (in Guangdong province), both bustling trade hubs in ninth-century China, from which the Belitung ship sailed. And where was the ship heading when it ran into reefs off Belitung Island? It appears to have deviated from the main shipping route that most vessels took when traversing the region. Was it perhaps blown off course? Or had it taken another course to avoid pirates? More likely, it was dropping off ceramics or acquiring new trade products and provisions at a port in Java.
Humble utilitarian items, which shed light on the lives of those on board, added another layer of interest to this discovery. The crew and other passengers on the vessel were most likely multinational. Arab or Persian traders probably chartered the ship, and brought with them vessels such as the turquoise-glazed amphora. On the long voyage, it would have made multiple stops in India and Southeast Asia to recruit new crew. There were most probably Chinese merchants on board also, as suggested by the inkstone used for writing.

The exact date when the ship embarked on its final journey has also been much discussed. The ceramics found in the shipwreck are the types produced in the ninth century, a dating which matches the results of radiocarbon tests on organic materials from the wreck. A date equivalent to 826 is thought to be incised on one of the Changsha bowls. It is thus likely that the Belitung ship sailed in the second quarter of the ninth century, possibly within a few seasons of the bowl's manufacture.

The Cargo
A commodity difficult for camels to transport via the overland Silk Road, shipping had made possible the large-scale export of ceramics from the mid-Tang dynasty. The Belitung ship carried close to 60,000 pieces of Chinese ceramics. But breakages were found at a relatively low level of approximately 20 percent, which suggests that there were more than 70,000 pieces of ceramics in the ship's original cargo. This is an impressive figure considering that the vessel measured approximately 18 metres by 6.5 metres. It carried numerous storage jars, of which many with larger openings were packed with ceramic bowls. The manner of packing â€“ many bowls were tightly arranged in a â€œhelixicalâ€ manner and probably cushioned by straw â€“ enabled the boat to carry such an enormous load. This packing method and the silt of the seabed also protected most of the cargo from damage.
The size of the cargo underscores the great popularity of Chinese ceramics, which were valued for their beauty, strength, and durability. These qualities were unrivalled by ceramics from other parts of the world. To cater to the growing demand, new kilns sprang up in many provinces in China, while old ones changed their technologies and products. For instance, there was a shift from producing low-fired tomb pottery to high-fired tableware. Assembled from diverse sources, the repertoire of wares in the cargo highlights the vitality and competitiveness of the Chinese ceramics industry. It also shows the merchants' entrepreneurial ways as they targeted different groups of clientele by exporting a range of goods.
Changsa Wares
Ceramics from the Changsha kilns in Hunan province dominated the cargo of the Belitung wreck. Approximately 57,500 items were produced by Changsha potters and among these were some 55,000 bowls. Most of these bowls carry one of a few basic patterns, which include foliage, flowers, birds, and clouds. However, these were created by many different artisans, hence giving an impression of a huge variety of designs that ranged from the realistic to the abstract. This staggering quantity of ceramics reflects the organisational and productive capacities of China's ceramic industry. Relatively isolated from the Tang court, major commercial centres and other kilns, Changsha potters developed a distinctive decorative style, featuring lively designs painted with iron and copper pigments. They introduced underglaze painting, blazing the way for the development of this form of ornamentation in Chinese ceramics.
The Changsha potters made a wide variety of forms and many of these were represented in the Belitung cargo. Apart from daily utensils like bowls and ewers, they also fashioned toys and scholars' implements such as water droppers. The potters often instilled an element of fun into their wares. A fine example is the incense burner that has a cover topped with a man tussling with a lion. The man is forcing open the mouth of the beast, which creates the hole where the smoke escapes.

Changsha wares appear to have been popular in both domestic and overseas markets. Significant quantities have been excavated at the port of Yangzhou, where they must have been stored before being shipped. They have also been found in large amounts in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia.
Other Ceramics
In addition to Changsha wares for the wider market, the ship ferried a selection of finer ceramics, reflecting the prevailing taste in China. Such an assortment of goods was made possible by the network of waterways (rivers and the Grand Canal) which linked northern and southern China, as well as inland cities to coastal ports. The items included high-fired white wares that represent the ceramic achievements of northern China, and green-glazed stone wares which were premier products of the south during the Tang period. During the eighth and ninth centuries, Yue celadons from Zhejiang and Hebei's Xing white wares were regarded as symbols of beauty, elegance, and wealth. The Chinese affection for monochrome ceramics crystallised at this time and reached its height in the Song dynasty (960 â€“ 1279).
The Tang cargo also contained three extremely rare blue-and-white dishes, which are among the earliest complete Chinese blue-and-white ceramics known.
Unlike the ceramics mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the production of blue-and-white wares was short-lived during the Tang dynasty, probably because it did not match the prevailing Chinese taste. The lozenge with leafy fronds, seen on the Belitung blue-and-white dishes, is a motif that originated in eighth- or early ninth-century Iraq. The cobalt used to paint the designs may have come from the Abbasid Empire. They were made chiefly for export, and the Belitung examples may have been experimental prototypes sent for the approval of Abbasid clients.
White Wares
Probably the most valuable ceramics on the ship was a relatively small consignment of white wares. Comprising some 300 pieces, they were drawn from three or four different kilns in northern China. The finest were produced at the Xing kilns in Hebei province. Thinly potted and covered with a glossy clear glaze, they were likened to snow and silver. The exquisite Xing wares were imitated by the Ding kilns located farther north in Hebei and the Gongxian kilns in Henan province. Although connoisseurs of Tang ceramics ranked Xing wares as supreme, the products of the Xing and Ding kilns were often very similar and almost indistinguishable. Attribution was made more difficult by the poor condition of some of the finds.
Green-splashed Wares
Almost 200 pieces of white wares decorated with copper-green splashes were recovered from the wreck. Chemical analysis of retrieved shards suggests that the majority of these ceramics came from the kilns at Gongxian in Henan province. Gongxian potters probably sought to develop alternative product lines as their white wares faced serious competition from Xing ceramics. These more colourful products appealed in particular to foreign markets. Tang green-splashed wares have been found at the Abbasid city of Samarra (Iraq) and the port of Siraf (Iran), among many other sites in the Near East region.
Green Wares
The most esteemed green wares from the Yue kilns in Zhejiang province were likened to jade. Lu Yu, a tea connoisseur from the Tang dynasty, rated Yue tea bowls most highly in his Chajing (The Classic of Tea), the first monograph on tea in the world. The lustrous glaze of Yue wares was perceived to enhance the tea's colour. Yue ceramics were thus often undecorated, emphasising the beauty of their glaze and form instead.
Of the approximately 900 pieces of green wares found on the ship, only around 200 were from the Yue kilns. The rest were products of Guangdong, which consisted mainly of sturdy storage containers and a small selection of tableware. The figures reflect the limited output of the Yue kilns, which seem to have rather strict quality control. Just like the many ceramic wares found on board, there was an enthusiastic foreign market for green wares, as indicated by their discovery at sites as far afield as Samarra in Iraq, Siraf in Iran, and Fustat (old Cairo) in Egypt.
Precious Metals
The gold, silver, and bronze objects found in the shipwreck constituted one of the most important discoveries of Tang metalwork, and the first outside of China. Especially rare are the objects of pure gold: an octagonal cup, three shallow bowls, and three dishes. Also discovered were silver boxes of varying forms, possibly used as containers for cosmetics, incense or medicine; and a richly decorated wine flask.
A total of 29 Chinese bronze mirrors were found in the wreck â€“ one of the largest assemblages of Tang mirrors ever discovered. Such a large collection suggests that the mirrors were meant to be sold, and not the crew's personal possessions. Among the mirrors was the only surviving example of a celebrated form called â€œJiangxinâ€ or â€œYangxinâ€ (Heart of the Yangzi River), which was previously recorded in texts. It was supposedly cast on board a boat moored in the Yangzi River at Yangzhou and charged with cosmological powers. Of extremely high quality, it was also presented as tribute to the imperial court.
Many of these objects were probably made in Yangzhou, a leading centre of fine craft. It remains a mystery for whom these luxuries were intended. The gold objects might have been gifts from the Tang emperor in return for tribute presented by a foreign mission. Or they might have been used by Chinese officials to ease trade negotiations over desirable imports from abroad, such as spices, pearls and other exotic rarities. Whichever the case, these extravagant articles indicate that the masters of the Belitung ship were engaged in dealings with the elite of Tang society.
Although there are still many puzzles surrounding the ship and its excavation has raised debate, the importance of this Tang shipwreck is immense. Its extensive cargo is one of the most significant assemblages of Tang artefacts found at a single site. Not only does it serve as a time capsule of ninth-century Tang China, it has also revealed the interactions between China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, showing an already very well connected world.

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 â€“ Jul to Sep 2011
The terracotta warriors of China's First Emperor, or Shi Huangdi, have drawn worldwide attention since their chance discovery outside Xi'an in 1974. They impress with their life-like appearance, the evident attention to detail and the fact that there are so many of them. To date in 2011, about 1,900 have been unearthed, but there may be as many as 8,000 figures all together. Investigation of the vast tomb complex of the First Emperor continues and new discoveries await. The terracotta warriors have been exhibited around the globe and have become worldwide celebrities. But they are more than just spectacle â€“ they tell us a great deal about history and art.
The terracotta warriors are connected with one of the most remarkable â€“ and controversial â€“ figures in China's history: the king of Qin who united China in 220 BCE and became the First Emperor. He invented for himself a new title, Huangdi, based on two words to describe mythical kings, and all emperors after him used the same title. He centralised authority and attempted to unify China by standardising her money, writing and measurements. However, after his death, he was condemned as corrupt, militaristic and despotic. He is alleged to have buried Confucian scholars alive and burned their books. And he built a grandiose tomb to himself that supposedly required the efforts of 700,000 workers.
Beyond this historical connection, the terracotta warriors are intriguing works of art that completely changed long-held beliefs about early Chinese art. Before the discovery of the terracotta warriors, nearly nothing was known about the art of the Qin dynasty, which was one of the pivot points in Chinese history. While the terracotta army confirmed the emperor's militaristic reputation, the figures themselves seemed to be the product of a cultured and sophisticated court. Often thought to be portraits of individual warriors, on close inspection, the figures repeat a few basic types. Details of armour, costume and footwear vary within certain patterns, and the faces seem to have individual personalities because six or eight different moulds were used; beards, moustaches, hair and other details were later added. Some soldiers were shaped to hold weapons or the reins of horses. Other figures seem to stand at attention.

The warriors present us with many mysteries and we cannot be certain of their precise meaning. They look real, but can we be sure that they accurately reflect Chinese soldiers of 2,200 years ago? The terracotta figures are not documents, but works of art made to decorate the First Emperor's tomb. They therefore had powerful symbolic value. Are they a legion of the emperor's army or his palace guard? We might assume that the warriors were meant to defend the emperor in the afterlife, but against what?
It is sobering to realise that the terracotta warriors, magnificent though they are, are only one part of a vast supporting structure of the First Emperor's tomb. The terracotta figures are divided among three pits. The largest contains more than 6,000 infantry, archers and commanders, plus fifty chariots, each drawn by four horses.

Pit 2 is smaller but contains more horses: 89 chariots, with four horses apiece, 116 horses with riders and additional infantry.

The smallest pit, Pit 3, contains a single chariot and 68 warriors. A fourth pit is empty.

The emperor's tomb is buried under a large, man-made, pyramidal hill. It is protected by mountains to the south and west, and water to the north. The terracotta warriors all face east. The tomb mound was surrounded by two walls that enclosed several buildings devoted to the rituals worshipping the deceased emperor. Surrounding the tomb were numerous pits, some containing actual human and animal remains.
Several half life-size chariots were buried very near the tomb. Wooden chariots ornamented with bronze and gold fittings were found on the north side, while to the west were the two famous bronze chariots, drawn by miniature bronze horses.

A pit containing thousands of small stone plaques was discovered in 1999. Eventually, someone realised that they used to form sets of armour. Because limestone is too heavy and too fragile to have been used in battle, the armour must have played a purely symbolic role. But we do not know who was meant to wear this symbolic armour.

Other discoveries show that the tomb world of the First Emperor was not only devoted to the military. Workers were buried near the tomb along with horses and other animals â€“ demonstrating that human and animal sacrifice, conducted in China for thousands of years, was still a part of imperial funerary practice. And twelve pottery officials were found huddled together in a small pit, ensuring that bureaucracy would live on with the emperor.
Another pit contained eleven life-size terracotta figures different from the warriors. These were bare-chested men in various animated poses. Compared to the blank expressions and stiff postures of the warriors, these acrobats are much livelier and even humorous, features that have no precedent in Chinese art. One heavily muscled figure, perhaps a weightlifter, has bulging biceps, a barrel chest and a thick belly supported by a wide belt. He must have originally held something against his body with his left arm, perhaps a pole. Together with his companions, he entertained the emperor at court.
Yet another pit housed musicians made of terracotta and birds made of bronze. Forty-six swans, geese, and cranes were neatly arranged along an artificial river of mercury. Near the water birds were fifteen musicians, which suggests that this venue was for relaxation and pleasure. Another pit contains the remains of exotic animals, perhaps a zoo to delight the emperor.
Taken as a whole, these discoveries show that many aspects of the emperor's life were recreated in underground burials. But any interpretation of the terracotta warriors remains tentative without knowledge of the tomb itself â€“ the underground palace that houses the emperor's coffin. No excavations have yet been conducted there, but further discoveries are sure to come.
We can speculate as to the meaning of the terracotta warriors. They may have been commemorative, that is, a celebration of the military power that unified China. Although the tomb was started when the First Emperor was still king of the Qin state, plans must have expanded significantly when he became emperor. The warriors undoubtedly played a protective role against evil forces (as similar figures had in earlier tombs), perhaps against the spirits of old enemies to the east. The army also appears to be a component of the emperor's worldly life made in symbolic form for the afterlife. It is very likely that the terracotta army had multiple meanings, and we should be open to new avenues of interpretation.
The terracotta sculptures have radically altered our understanding of early Chinese art. Despite the overwhelming historical importance of Shi Huangdi, almost nothing could be associated with his reign. Objects from the Shang and Zhou dynasties had been greatly appreciated for their abstract patterns and decorative designs especially bronze vessels. At the exhibition Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor and His Legacy, the Asian Civilisations Museum showcased a range of goods buried in Qin state tombs before the reign of the First Emperor. These included ritual bronzes, jades and gold objects.
The Han Dynasty
Tiger tally, Warring States period (475 - 221 BCE), Bear, Western Han dynasty, 1st century BCE, Rooster, Western Han dynasty, 2nd century BCE, Crane, Qin dynasty (221 - 206 BCE).
The Qin dynasty quickly collapsed after the death of the First Emperor. After a period of civil war, Liu Bang established the Han dynasty in 202 BCE. Many of the First Emperor's reforms were retained. The small seal script, standardised weights and measures, and revised coinage continued to be used during the Han empire. Using the Qin bureaucratic system, the Han dynasty developed a highly centralised government and successfully ruled China for four centuries.
Han tombs, however, are very different from the First Emperor's. It seems as though the first Han emperors, while retaining the long tradition of burying terracotta figures, wished to separate themselves as much as possible from Shi Huangdi. Early Han rulers preferred simplicity to sumptuousness, the miniature to monumentality. Compared to the life- size Qin terracotta figures, Han pottery figurines are much smaller and represent many aspects of daily life. In addition to soldiers and courtiers, Han tombs feature kitchens and domestic animals. The sacrificial pits around Emperor Jing's mausoleum contain a great number of officials, entertainers and attendants. The faces of these figurines are softly contoured, usually with graceful facial expressions and serene smiles. The Han people's affection for tranquillity and simplicity was based on the core concept of Daoism â€“ the pursuit of harmony with nature.

In the pits around Yangling, the tomb of Emperor Jing, large numbers of soldiers were found naked and armless. Originally, they had wooden arms and wore costumes made of cotton and silk. Just as the First Emperor inherited a rich tradition, so was his legacy a powerful one. Although the Western Han dynasty tried its best to set itself apart from the notorious unifier of China, it followed the same ancient traditions of burial and preparation for the afterlife. The soldiers and court officials made in terracotta for Han tombs provide a fascinating contrast to the imposing Qin terracotta warriors. The First Emperor perhaps must now be regarded as a force in art as powerful as in military might and governmental authority. The terracotta warriors and the other objects from his tomb complex continue to startle and delight us because they are magnificent works of art.

A Centre for Cultural Exchanges
Sumatra's position along the Straits of Malacca has resulted in a cultural legacy that illustrates how various streams of influence took place. Over the past two millennia, Indian, Chinese, Islamic, regional and European influences prevailed at different times.
The material cultures presented in the exhibition Sumatra: Isle of Gold included Bronze-Age objects of the early Austronesian communities, Hindu-Buddhist materials of the maritime kingdom of Srivijaya (7th-13th centuries), Chinese materials both imported and locally made, court arts of the coastal Islamic sultanates such as Aceh, Jambi and Palembang, Riau-Lingga and Siak. Artefacts that show interactions with remote cultures such as Batak and Nias and objects made in response to European influence during the colonial period, one also included.
Indian Influences â€“ The Legacy of Ancient Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms
Indian sources from the 3rd century BCE and later mention of Suvarnadvipa or â€˜Gold Island', which probably included the region and later Sumatra. Although gold was mined in Sumatra, natural resources such as benzoin (a fragrant resin used in perfumery and ritual offerings), camphor (another aromatic resin obtained from a forest tree) and by the 15th century, pepper, were highly sought after by overseas markets. These goods were traded for prized imported commodities such as Indian printed cloth and Chinese ceramics.

Hindu-Buddhist traditions probably arrived from India during the early centuries of the Common Era. The writings of the Chinese monk and pilgrim Yi Jing, provide some of the earliest evidence of the Srivijaya kingdom and Buddhist centre at Palembang during the late 7th century. Additional evidence for this kingdom arises from several inscriptions in the Indian Pallava script such as the Kota Kapur stele (dated 686 CE) from Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. The stele's location indicates an extensive network rather than a state with defined borders. It also provides evidence for the use of Indic scripts as the foundations of Old Malay and other local written languages.

Palembang's authority declined following Javanese attacks during the late 10th and 13th centuries, and the invasion of Indian Chola armies in the early 11th century. Eventually, the Malayu kingdom took control, but was forced to give way to the East Javanese kingdoms of Singhasari and then Majapahit during the 14th century. Malayu eventually withdrew inland to the Padang highlands, leaving behind an artistic legacy that reflects strong Javanese influences and the practice of Tantric Buddhism.
Trade with India also left its mark in the textile traditions of the wealthy elites. Large Indian trade cloths of the 17th century â€“ the precursors of later batik designs â€“ were worn by aristocrats, whilst the sumptuous songket weaving tradition produced shimmering cloths of gold that are still highly prized today.

Chinese Influences
It is difficult to pinpoint when Chinese traders and settlers first arrived in Sumatra. Chinese ceramics dating from the early centuries of the Common Era onwards have been retrieved from private collections. Archaeological evidence now shows that China traded directly with other countries as early as the 9th century. An Arab dhow that was salvaged at Belitung Island off southeast Sumatra carried a cargo of some 60,000 objects. These included mainly ceramics, as well as extremely rare gold and silver items thought to be official gifts for the courts in Iran (Persia).
Chinese presence in the region increased during the Ming dynasty (1368- 1644). Large expeditions by imperial envoy Zheng He cultivated tributary trade with Southern Ocean (Nanhai) countries during the 14th century. Migration from southern China increased particularly during the Colonial period when the Chinese ran businesses and worked for the administration as supervisors, tax collectors and tin miners.
Chinese settlement in coastal areas, especially Palembang, spawned successful alliances with the ruling elites. Inter-marriages resulted in the Peranakan, or â€˜local born' communities notable for their unique material culture that combines Chinese, local and European influences. Chinese lacquer-makers for example, were encouraged by the court to settle in Palembang where they became renowned. By 1813, one thousand Arabs and Chinese lived in Palembang. Their artistic traditions thrived as one of the court arts alongside ivory-carving, textiles and weapon-forging. Traditional symbols such as the phoenix and dragon (representing the Chinese empress and emperor, respectively), the fish (a symbol of fertility), the Chinese characters for happiness (fu), wealth (lu) and longevity (shou), and Buddhist emblems were in turn often adopted by other communities as decorative motifs.
The arrival of Islam
Islam was established in Sumatra during the 13th century through trade with Muslim merchants and the founding of the first Islamic kingdom at Samudra-Pasai in Aceh. Most of the coastal sultanates derived their heritage from Malayu, the ancient seat of the Srivijaya kingdom. They became wealthy through international trade conducted at coastal ports and the courts became centres for cultural exchange with Mughal India, China, Europe, Iran and other countries in West Asia.
Diverse cultural influences are evident in the different styles of Islamic architecture, textiles and the court arts patronised by the different sultanates. These items became royal regalia, the treasured heirlooms or pusaka that enhanced the legitimacy of rulers. They also included gifts from overseas which over time acquired legendary fame for their protective powers.
Foreign imports and skills from the Islamic World were highly valued. Silk and gold thread from India and China were used for royal garments, whilst Ottoman Turkish craftsmen sent to Aceh in the 16th century left a legacy of jewellery-making techniques. Diamonds and precious stones were imported from Persia and were brought from Kalimantan by Bugis traders. Keris-forging was introduced by the Javanese in the 13th century as well as by Bugis traders from South Sulawesi who travelled extensively and settled in the port areas of Sumatra.

Regional Exchanges between the Coast and the Central Highlands
Regional exchanges of cultural influence also took place between remote communities in the interior and coastal trading centres. Highland communities required metals for tools, jewellery and ritual objects, porcelain, salt and cloth. Coastal traders sought gold and natural products from the forests, and relied on the highlanders to transport these commodities via rivers or difficult land routes to the coast.
The Batak of Sumatra's northern islands have ancient Hindu-Buddhist connections with early Indian settlers who moved into the interior from coastal regions. By the 19th century they had adopted Islam from Minangkabau and Aceh. However religious practices still combine ancestor worship and animistic rituals. These streams of influence are reflected in the motifs and designs of their jewellery, sculpture and other ritual objects.
Although more remote, the islanders of Sumatra's west coast such as the Nias community also traded with their neighbours. Gold was an important part of the jewellery tradition patronised and worn by the Nias nobility. The nobles distinguished themselves from commoners and slaves by commissioning gold jewellery, which is also seen in the carved adornments on wood figures of the ancestors.

Ideas from the West
Europeans had known about Sumatra since Marco Polo's visit to the island's northern coast en route from China in the late 13th century. The Portuguese and Dutch arrived in the region during the 16th and 18th centuries respectively. However it was not until the 19th century that Dutch influence was consolidated in Sumatra. The 1824 the Anglo-Dutch Treaty signed between the Dutch and the British finally resolved conflicting interests in the region, including the role of Sir Stamford Raffles, who had been Governor of Bencoolen (1817 â€“ 1823). One of the terms of the treaty resulted in the exchange of Sumatra for Dutch interests in the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore.
European trade for the most part was done with coastal communities, who sourced the much wanted pepper, gold, camphor and benzoin from the hinterlands. However, European influence also left its mark both on the courts as well as remote tribal communities. Christianity found its way to the Batak highlands from the 1860s onwards and Lake Toba, the ancestral homeland of the Batak, only first visited by Europeans in the late 19th century.
Local arts and crafts were also influenced by European interests. Objects collected during scientific expeditions and commissioned specially for large international exhibitions held in Europe during the late 19th century, included pieces made in European taste. The legacy of collecting was maintained through museums, the new cultural storehouses. The â€˜colonial gaze' or way of perceiving local cultures still underpins some museum displays today, and could be said to be yet another stream of cultural influence that fostered the rich heritage of Sumatra.
From 30 July till 7 November 2010, the exhibition Sumatra: Isle of Fold at the Asian Civilisations Museum was the culmination of a collaborative project between the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, the Netherlands, and the National Museum of Indonesia with the support of provincial museums in Sumatra. The show travelled from Jakarta to Leiden before coming to Singapore. The Asian Civilisations Museum adapted the show to include more pieces from its own and private collections.

""One day a clerk named Ibrahim came to my house and mentioned in conversation that Mr Raffles was looking for Malay clerks with a good hand, and he wanted to buy Malay documents and romances of olden times.""
â€“ Hikayat Abdullah, 1849. Translated by Ian Proudfoot.
In some of the European libraries today, you will find Malay manuscripts which were brought there by scholars, missionaries and administrators from colonial times. In the National Library's exhibition, Tales of the Malay World: Manuscripts and Early Books, visitors had the opportunity to view rare books from the holdings of three important European institutions: the British Library; the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; and Leiden University Library from 18 August 2017 to 25 February 2018. For the first time, many of these manuscripts were returned to the region in which they were originally written. Together with the National Library's Rare Materials Collection, these artefacts told fascinating stories of the societies that wrote and read them.
While people today tend to perceive reading as primarily a visual act, written Malay works were traditionally experienced orally and aurally. The reading of manuscripts aloud to an audience is mentioned in various old Malay manuscripts. A well-known episode in the Sulalat al-Salatin (Genealogy of Kings) relates how the nobles of Melaka requested for the Hikayat Muhammad Hana ah to be read to them on the eve of their battle with the invading Portuguese. Intended to spur valour, the hikayat (narrative tale) relates the romanticised exploits of the Islamic warrior Muhammad Hana ah, half-brother of Prophet Muhammad's grandsons. To emphasise the oral-aural experience of Malay manuscripts, this exhibition featured a recitation of this episode from the Sulalat al-Salatin, as well as the singing of two works of syair (poetry).

World of Malay Literary Manuscripts
Our understanding of traditional Malay written literature depends largely on what has survived. Except for a few written in southern Sumatran scripts, almost all extant Malay manuscripts are written in Jawi (modified Arabic script). Islam played a prominent role in the development of the Malay written literary tradition. The earliest literary works are believed to have been created in the 14th century, after the arrival of Islam in the region, and they even include stories with Hindu-Buddhist influences like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

This exhibition introduced visitors to various kinds of literary works such as court chronicles that trace the genealogy of ruling families (image 03), romantic and historical poetry (image 04), fantastical adventure stories and Su tales (image 05). Generally, the terms referring to these literary works include salasilah (genealogy), hikayat and syair.

The majority of these works are anonymous and undated, which makes it difficult for scholars to trace the development of Malay traditional literature. Those that contain additional information provide rare glimpses into the production of manuscripts and their readers. For example, the only known manuscript that contains an inscription of the artist's name â€“ Cik Mat (Muhammad) Tuk Muda, son of Raja Indera Wangsa, from Kayangan, Perlis â€“ also has a note in which the owner Cik Candra implores readers to take good care of the manuscript. Lending libraries were established in various urban centres in the 19th century. This exhibition featured a few examples of such manuscripts for loan, such as the popular Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati, a Panji tale copied by Muhammad Bakir, whose family ran a lending library in Batavia (Jakarta) from the mid to late 19th century.

Market for Manuscripts
Traditionally, access to manuscripts was limited, as they were held at the courts by feudal chiefs or storytellers. Scholars have mostly credited Stamford Raffles (1781- 1826) for creating a public market for Malay written texts. He started buying manuscripts in a way similar to how he collected natural history specimens, and even hired a team of six scribes to copy texts that he had borrowed. In this exhibition, there is a hikayat that was copied by one of Raffles' scribes, Ibrahim Kandu, a Chulia who lived on the Prince of Wales Island (Penang). The British were not the only Europeans actively collecting; the Dutch were also collecting in earnest. European administrators and scholars collected Malay manuscripts to learn the language and understand the culture, so as to better administer the region or to fulfill missionary purposes.

From Written to Printed
The adoption of the lithographic press by Malay/Muslim printers from the mid-19th century onwards had a dramatic effect on the manuscript tradition. Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir (c. 1797-1854), better known as Munshi Abdullah, is considered a pioneer of Malay printing. He had learnt printing from the English missionary, Walter Medhurst (1796-1857) while in Melaka, and was involved in various mission publications as either translator or editor. Abdullah even composed new works to be printed, becoming the first non-European to have his work printed in Malay.
From the mid-19th century, Singapore, or more specifically Kampong Gelam, grew to become an important printing hub for Malay/Islamic books that were distributed throughout the Malay world. Lithography basically reproduced the manuscript format, but enabled multiple copies to be produced economically. Like their manuscript counterparts, these early mass-produced printed hikayat and syair were also recited or sung for an audience. However, one important difference is that these printed texts were now widely available for sale. By the turn of the 20th century, however, Singapore printers had begun to decline as the local and regional markets saw an influx of Malay books from Bombay, Cairo, Mecca and Istanbul. In this exhibition, visitors discovered prominent printers, their marketing tactics, and their bestselling titles.

Enduring Stories
While many of us in Singapore may not be familiar with traditional Malay literature, there are some stories that have endured through the centuries. This exhibition explored three such literary works: Sulalat al-Salatin (Genealogy of Kings; popularly known as the Sejarah Melayu), Hikayat Hang Tuah (Tale of Hang Tuah) and Hikayat Pelanduk Jenaka (Tale of the Wily Mousedeer). All three works have been adapted as novels, comics, plays or films. Of interest to Singaporeans will be the Sulalat al-Salatin, which contains a legend about early Singapore and how it got its name. The popular tale about the attack of the garfish can also be found in the Sulalat al- Salatin. Visitors were able to view the earliest manuscripts of Sulalat al-Salatin (known to scholars as â€œRaffles 18â€) and the Hikayat Hang Tuah in physical form, as well as through a retelling on the silver screen.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 1 - Apr to Jun 2015
On 28 January 2015, the National Heritage Board (NHB) announced the activities planned for the commemoration of the 73rd anniversary of the fall of Singapore. The guided tours to the Attap Valley Bunker attracted a lot of attention from the media and the general public. This is because the bunker is sited on restricted land and it was the first time a guided tour could be organised to take the public through the pre-war military structure constructed by the British to transform Singapore into an impregnable fortress. This was made possible through the efforts of NHB, Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and Singapore Police Force (SPF). The guided tour would take participants inside the well-preserved bunker, an unprecedented move. But the larger story surrounding the Attap Valley Bunker may be that there are still other similar sites that have been â€œforgottenâ€ and are waiting to be found.

The Singapore Naval Base and the Armament Depot
The Attap Valley Bunker's original name was a simple one: Magazine No. 4. It was part of a network of 18 underground bomb-proof storage bunkers connected by a metre-gauge railway line. These 18 bunkers made up the Armament Depot of the Singapore Naval Base. The Singapore Naval Base was the key component to a British defence plan to protect all British colonies from Hong Kong to Burma. The plan was dubbed the â€œSingapore Strategyâ€, and it led to the construction of a modern naval base in Singapore capable of providing anchorage and maintenance for the largest of the British warships.
In the event of trouble in the region, selected ships from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean would be reorganised and dispatched to Singapore. The Singapore naval base would serve as command headquarters and port for Royal Navy ships that operated in the region. The outbreak of war in Europe and in the Mediterranean in 1939, however, meant that no Royal Navy warships could be spared for operations in Singapore. When Japanese forces threatened British interests in Malaya and Singapore, the British sent only a token force of two capital ships in December 1941 to Singapore â€” the HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse â€” along with an escort of four destroyers to deter the Japanese Imperial Navy. The warships made a brief stop at the Singapore Naval Base before they were deployed to search and intercept Japanese forces along the east coast of Malaya. The Japanese sunk the warships, and the British were left with a modern naval base but no fleet.
The dockyards of the Singapore Naval Base survived the Japanese occupation and Singapore's modernisation after independence. The fate of the Armament Depot of the Singapore Naval Base was less well-known to the general public. After the Japanese occupation, the British returned to Singapore and took over the Singapore Naval Base, using it to support British operations in the region. As part of an agreement to withdraw all British forces from Singapore, the Armament Depot was handed to the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) after the British withdrew in September 1971. The site continued to operate as a depot until 2002 when it was decommissioned. All the structures that once made up the depot â€” including the underground storage bunkers â€” were demolished in phases before the site was handed back to the State. Magazine No. 4 was one of the last surviving underground ammunition stores.
The First Tour
On 7 February 2015, two busloads of Singaporeans were taken to a remote spot along the north coast of Singapore. The location was not far from the Senoko Fishery Port. The bus travelled past an old iron gate topped with barbed wire. After travelling on a winding stony trail, the bus reached the coastline. Everyone was instructed to get of the bus. There was jungle everywhere and it did not feel like Singapore anymore. This was the start of NHB's first guided tour to the Attap Valley Bunker.
Exploring the interior of the bunker.
The Attap Valley Bunker is located at the foot of a hill once known as Talbots Hill, which also housed six similar underground bombproof stores that no longer exist. The tour started at the entrance of the bunker, which was a few minutes' walk along a dirt path from where the visitors disembarked. A set of rusty double metal doors partially blocked the entrance to a long corridor. The tour participants had to wade across ankle-deep mud and water along the corridor to reach the storage area. The corridor, lit only by the participants' torchlights, led to a cavernous storage space of nearly 300 square metres.
There were two gantry cranes installed inside the storage space, and each crane had a loading capacity of one and a half tonnes. Metal plates welded on the crane showed that they were manufactured and supplied by Marshall Fleming & Co Ltd in 1937. Signboards reminding operators of the crane's loading capacity were later installed on the cranes, which indicated that the cranes were still in use after the war. The tour participants were given the opportunity to explore the bunker on their own before they were guided back along the same muddy, flooded corridor to the bunker's entrance. By the end of February, 11 groups of Singaporeans had visited the Attap Valley Bunker on NHB's guided tour programme.

Finding â€˜Forgotten' Sites in Singapore
The 11 guided tours to the Attap Valley Bunker were part of NHB's commemorative programmes for the 73rd anniversary of the battle for Singapore and the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Singapore. The aim of the tours was to share NHB's research on pre-war and wartime sites and structures that are lesser-known to Singaporeans. Participants on the tour were baffled by the fact that a large site like the Attap Valley Bunker still existed in a highly urbanised Singapore. The question most asked by participants on the tour was if there were still more sites like Attap Valley Bunker waiting to be discovered and documented. NHB's work in 2014 researching and documentingthe Keppel Hill â€œforgottenâ€ reservoir, remnants of the 1887 New Lunatic Asylum wall and the Marsiling Tunnels suggests that there are still more sites waiting to be discovered. The question is why.
Singapore was a British colony and development of the island during the colonial period reflected this. All major government buildings were located inside the city district, which was fairly well-defined. When viewed through the eyes of the British and locals, colonial Singapore had a real frontier, which stretched from the edges of the city district to the coastline. This was rural Singapore. Plantations, farms and kampongs shared this rural space with British military camps and installations, as well as infrastructure buildings such as fuel and water storage facilities. As the city core expanded, it pushed its periphery to the physical edges of the island, absorbing and colonising what was once Singapore's rural space. Buildings and sites in the rural areas were either torn down or abandoned to make way for urban development.
There are no more physical frontiers on mainland Singapore today. NHB's research efforts uncovering the Keppel Hill Reservoir, the 1887 New Lunatic Asylum wall and the Attap Valley Bunker reveal Singapore's old frontiers and layers of the past. These historical sites offer a way to look at Singapore through the eyes of the British who planned the development of the island as a colony. In tracing the development of Singapore's frontiers, we are reminded of the many layers of the past we stand on. As the nation continues to develop, we will uncover more layers of Singapore's past, strengthening our identity and enriching the Singapore story beyond SG50.

Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 4 â€“ Oct to Dec 2012
Zubir Said, also affectionately known as Pak Zubir, is most well known as the composer of Singapore's national anthem, Majulah Singapura. In an institutional sense, the acceptance of the song as the national anthem, and its first performance at the â€˜Loyalty Week' on 3 December 1959, marked the peak of Pak Zubir's career in music1. This was at a stage of his life when he was deeply engaged in composing â€˜patriotic' songs as an expression of his belief that one should pay tribute to the nation in which one lives in. However, his identity as the anthem's composer tends to overshadow the fullness of his life, which was filled with a ceaseless exploratory spirit and a sense of adventure that gave rise to many creative endeavours and hundreds of songs which now resonate throughout the archipelago.
It is a little known fact that Pak Zubir was an influential figure within the rise of what we now affectionately call the golden age of Singapore cinema in the late 1940s to 1960s. Perhaps, this is due to an auteuristic tendency in film spectatorship which endows utmost emphasis on the creativity of the director, and the star-system which casts a glamorous spotlight on actors and actresses. However, filmmaking during the golden era was more than the sum of its directors and acting talents. It was a collective act of creative production that brought into play scriptwriters, set designers, playback singers, and of course, composers who imbued the screen images with the affects of songs and soundscapes, and inscribed links between film and music cultures.
Music was an essential aspect of our films from the golden age. The pioneering wave of directors in Singapore in the 1940s and 1950s, such as B. S. Rajhans and B. N. Rao, brought with them stylistic traits of Indian cinema. These included the convention of having a series of song sequences throughout the film which acted as aphorisms that propelled the narrative and encapsulated the emotions and sensations expressed in the film through verse and melody. This proved to be a popular trait which audiences came to expect, and it became an inherent construct within our cinema heritage. It was within this milieu and aspect of filmmaking in which Pak Zubir emerged as a pioneering music composer in Singapore who had brought forth many innovations and humble revolutions to the role of music in film and Singapore society.
Pak Zubir's pioneering ethos in music composition was a clear expression of a strong will towards independence and living on one's own terms. He was born into a Minangkabau family on 22 July 1907 in Bukit Tinggi, West Sumatra. His father, Muhamad Said Sanang, a well respected village headman, strongly opposed his son's musical aspirations as he felt that music was harum (prohibited in Islam)2. As such, Pak Zubir never received a formal education in music. However, he retained a strong fascination towards music, and learnt his musical skills from different communities and individuals. In school, Pak Zubir learnt to read and write the solmisasi system of numerical musical notation. He also learnt to play drums and guitar from a keroncong club3. Upon graduation, Pak Zubir played with the village keroncong orchestra, and learnt to play the violin from a musician who performed music accompaniment at a silent film cinema. Soon after, he quit his day job at the Dutch administration office to join a keroncong troupe which travelled around Sumatra.
Pak Zubir was 22 years old when he accepted a sailor friend's offer to journey to Singapore on a small cargo boat, only bringing with him a clean towel, a few shirts and a small amount of money, which was all that he had. In Minangkabau tradition, it is a rite of passage for young men to experience merantau, to travel out of their home environment to seek their fortune. After travelling through Sumatra, Pak Zubir's wanderlust extended towards the archipelago, and he had to experience Singapore, the thriving entrepÃ´t which he came to know as a place of electricity, and kopi susu and butter â€“ both of which he had never tasted before. Peering out from the cargo boat, Pak Zubir caught his first sight of Singapore when he arrived in the wee hours of the morning. He was wholly fascinated by the bright lights glimmering from the island that he would soon call home.
Recalling his early experience of Singapore, Pak Zubir emphasised the exalting feeling of freedom and cultural diversity of its society. He started his first job as a pianist and violinist for the City Opera, a large bangsawan troupe that staged performances at Happy Valley Park in Tanjong Pagar4. There he met Malay, Straits-born Chinese (Peranakan), Indian and Filipino musicians who worked collectively to perform a repertoire of songs which featured Malay, Chinese and Indian stories. Already skilled in number notation, Pak Zubir rapidly mastered staff notation, copied all the troupe's scores in both systems, and soon became the leader of the ensemble. He was recruited by The Gramophone Company (commonly known as His Master's Voice) thereafter, where he worked as a recording supervisor who also travelled through Malaysia and Indonesia as a talent scout.

1948 marked the year when Pak Zubir stepped into the arching gates of the golden age of Singapore cinema. Helmed by the two major studios, Shaw Brother's Malay Film Productions and Cathay-Keris Films, this was the era of the post-war studio system which reached a combined average output of 15 to 20 films annually.
Pak Zubir was introduced to the chief of Malay Film Productions, Shaw Bee Hock, who recruited him as a freelance composer over at their studio in Jalan Ampas. The first film he worked on was Chinta (1948, B. S. Rajhans), which starred Siput Sarawak and S. Roomai Noor as lovers star-crossed by the tussles of previous generations. As not all screen actors could sing, Pak Zubir brought in the practice of voice-dubbing and recruited Nona Aishah and P. Ramlee, who also starred in his first ever screen role, to perform as playback singers. Another Shaw film Pak Zubir had worked on was Rachun Dunia (1950, B. S. Rajhans), a modern melodrama which featured one of his most celebrated compositions, Sayang Di Sayang.

Pak Zubir, however, felt that musical composition could be developed further. He believed that the musical palette for a motion picture should not be contained within the songs, but should be used effectively to convey the array of emotions throughout the film. During its early days of production, Malay Film Productions had a practice of using pre-recorded tracks for background music. Sensing greater opportunities for creativity, Pak Zubir subsequently joined Cathay-Keris Films as a full-time composer of both film songs and background music. There he composed songs and background music for some of the most highly regarded films which are now part of our heritage, such as Sumpah Pontianak (1958, B. N. Rao), Dang Anom (1962, Hussain Haniff ) which won the award for Best Folk Songs and Dances at the ninth Asian Film Festival, and Chu- chu Datok Merah (1963, M. Amin).

Pak Zubir was the first composer in Singapore to create original background music specifically for films. While songs were composed prior to, or during the film shoot, background music was created after the film was completed. Pak Zubir would start with a central melody which he then expanded into different styles and variations according to the changing moods and character motifs in the film. As he had to work with an average of only eight musicians when film music generally needed a larger orchestra, Pak Zubir had to experiment to create a grand effect with the little that he had.
In composing music for Malay films, Pak Zubir encountered two hurdles. Firstly, he felt that it was limiting to draw only from the repertoire and traditions of Malay music as they generally contained only two contrasting moods, happy and sad, while films contained a diversity of emotions. Secondly, Pak Zubir was acutely aware of the homogenising effects of the burgeoning commercialisation of popular music, which he saw as detrimental towards the development of a wider spectrum of music that â€œadds to the richness of the form of music within every nation.â€ As a creative escape from these two constraints, Pak Zubir continued to look to his Minangkabau heritage, conjuring the sounds of keroncong and bangsawan, while innovatively and self-reflexively infusing a wide array of cultural notes, which included styles such as Malay asli, Indian raga tala, and even Hawaiian, Arabic and Filipino sounds.
As a composer, Pak Zubir cherished authenticity and originality. He felt that the â€œstate of independence achieved by a nation is greatly connected to the heritage and culture of that nation,â€ and strove to reflect the mindset of his time through diverse forms of music that could be easily understood and appreciated beyond entertainment purposes. From the mid-1950s, while he was still working at Cathay-Keris, he had begun to write â€˜patriotic' songs such as Semoga Bahagia, Hari Kemerdekaan and, of course, Majulah Singapura, all of which are timeless and cherished communal musical expressions of our nation. For his film music compositions, we witness the same motivations at work, but within certain entanglements which he strove to loosen. It cannot be ignored that the film industry is a commercial vehicle aimed at the masses. In Pak Zubir's film music compositions, we sense the critical drive of a composer striving to express the soul and the culture of the community within an entertainment medium. With modernity, Western influences have been shaping and changing the contours of local music forms. When Pak Zubir had to reflect these influences in tune with filmic narratives, he had thought deeply on how they could be appropriated in a way that would still allow the heart of Malay music to resonate down in history.
Zubir Said with Ho Ah Loke, the co-owner of Cathay-Keris Films from 1953 to 1960.
Throughout his life, Pak Zubir continued to utilise number notation to compose music, and spent his later years teaching it to the younger generation at his apartment in Joo Chiat Road. He did so not only because it is the most common method of documenting Malay traditional music, but also because of its simplicity. He saw the system as building blocks which anyone with an interest in music could utilise to participate in the creation of diverse forms of musical expression. On top of the many songs Pak Zubir contributed to our nation, his view of the relation between music and nation building has imparted an important lesson to all of us: the significance of music as an expression of the common thread and ideals of the community, and the joyfulness of a democratic drive in which everyone in the community has the means to participate in the creation of the arts and culture of the nation.
In Pak Zubir's lifetime, the brimming bright lights of Singapore, which he saw from the small cargo boat when he first arrived, had led him to become a bearer of the constellation of lights and sounds of the golden age of Singapore cinema. This constellation of lights and sounds continues to brighten the darkness of our cinema halls today. For Pak Zubir, it started with a fascination which led to an adventure. It is with this sense and feeling that he had composed his music and imagined the future of the nation.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2010
From Yayoi Kusama's pioneering works of abstract expressionism to Takashi Murakami's works that express Japanese Pop Art, the exhibition Trans-Cool TOKYO provided an opportunity to view works by groundbreaking Japanese artists who have made an indelible impact on contemporary art. Featuring over 40 works from the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo collection, this exhibition also told the story of how Japanese artists, since the second half of the 1990s, have established their own creative identities within the context of global pop culture. Working across all mediums, from painting and sculpture, to performance, photography and video, the featured artists have created works in response to the onset of the information age and the greater freedom and uncertainties in contemporary society. Trans-Cool TOKYO was co-organised by the Singapore Art Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. It ran from 19 November 2010 to 13 February 2011.
The Formative 60s and 70s
After Japan's defeat in the Second World War, many Japanese artists born or practising their art in the 1950s sought to redefine their identity with reference to Western culture. This is typified by the work of Yasumasa Morimura (b. 1951) in this exhibition. Here, Morimura depicts himself in well-known Western paintings, such as in Criticism and the Lover A, B, C where his face is inserted into each of the apples and oranges of the famous still-life paintings by French impressionist Paul CÃ©zanne.

Suffering from psychoneurosis and schizophrenia since early childhood, Yayoi Kusama (b. 1929) experienced hallucinations in which everything she saw was covered with polka dots and negative forms. Transforming otherwise common objects and scenes into seemingly repetitive but unique organic shapes, Kusama's work is a manifestation of intense focus and obsession. Her work Walking on the Sea of Death (1981) comes from a mental image she had of a boat covered with silver rhizoids (phalluses) printed repeatedly all over the inside of a room.

The Postmodern 80s
Artists who started their practice in the 1980s had less of an inferiority complex towards, or an over-awareness of the West. This was also a time of economic boom in Japan, where the strong Japanese Yen made it easy for these artists to travel abroad. These artists adopted a more international perspective and tried to develop a visual language that would enable them to stand on par with Western artists.
The works of Yoshitomo Nara (b. 1959) and Takashi Murakami's (b. 1962) have come to be part of Japanese pop art and exhibit the Japanese quality known as kawaii (suggesting cuteness). The adult world and its sensibilities were rejected for immaturity and innocence. Nara's manga-esque children in his paintings react to the state of the world with suspicion and anger, glaring at the viewer. Murakami's works of animal anime icons that divide and proliferate at a cellular level appear as cute yet at the same time creepy protean monsters.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the end of the economic bubble, resulting in a â€œlost decadeâ€ of low economic growth. This insecurity over the future translated to Japanese artists taking inner, personal exploration even further, continuing ways to connect with personal communities otherwise overlooked by governments and conventional organisations. Artists such as Kohei Nawa (b. 1971) and Haruka Kojin (b. 1983) belong to this generation of artists.

New Japanese Art
One of the foremost characteristics of Japanese contemporary art of today is a growing interest from its artists in their own culture rather than that of overseas culture. Perhaps due to the declining Japanese economy, falling birth rates and ageing population, there is increased conservatism, conformism and introspective tendencies among Japanese youth today. Art is no longer viewed as something equated with privilege and prestige; instead it is increasingly tied closely to everyday life, and art overlaps with other fields more now, such as fashion, design, video, film and technology.
Ryoji Ikeda (b. 1966) composes his works based on reducing from our environment the behaviour of sound and light waves into the very basic elements known to man such as pixels and sine waves (a mathematical construct that deciphers and decodes sound into its different wavelengths). Wanting to make visible the invisible, Ikeda reduces the daily stimuli we encounter in our everyday lives and then puts them back together digitally, re-composing our environments into art installations with light and music that re-interact with our physical bodies on a digital plane.

Recycling a telephone booth into a one-man disco, Kiichiro Adachi's (b. 1979) work e.e.no.24 sheds light on the relationship between people in society by introducing elements of the fantastic and the magical. The work allows the shy dancer, too self-conscious to dance in front of others, to do so in its magical mirrored interior so that he or she is only able to see himself or herself. The booth, whose walls are one-way mirrors, however, also reveals the dancing figure within to those standing on the outside.

What will be the future direction of Japanese contemporary art? If the works shown in this exhibition provide any clue, aesthetics and sensibilities still rooted in local culture, yet informed by globalism, will inspire new Japanese contemporary art. This art will remain deeply connected to the individual in society, and will be part of the ongoing search to understand the relationship between oneself and the world.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 - Jun 2017
The tree with deep roots does not tremble in winds; its flowers are perfect, its fruit abundant. Waters rising from deep sources do not end in drought; forming a river, they flow on to the sea.
- Yongbi eochonga (Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven)1
Like a tree with deep roots, the Joseon dynasty which spanned more than 500 years is one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the world. Founded in 1392 by the military general Yi Seonggye (1335 to 1408), the new dynastic name Joseon was based on that of Korea's first kingdom, called Gojoseon. Apart from referencing Korea's legendary past, the name also signalled Yi's desire for new beginnings, for Joseon means â€œFresh Dawnâ€ or â€œNew Dynastyâ€.
General Yi, also known as King Taejo (reigned from 1392 to 1398), broke with the past by moving the capital from Gaegyeong (present-day Gaesong, North Korea) to a new site â€“ Hanyang (present-day Seoul). More importantly, he supplanted Buddhism with Neo-Confucianism as the kingdom's state ideology. King Taejo as well as his successors sought to curtail the power and excesses of the Buddhist establishment, which had become saddled with corruption.
This elevated status of Neo-Confucianism distinguished the Joseon period from preceding dynasties by greatly shaping political and socio-cultural life, as well as much of the arts produced during the era. For instance, the Confucian emphasis on modesty can be discerned from Joseon porcelain which were often simple yet elegantly designed (fig. 1).
(Fig. 1) Moon jar, 18th century. Porcelain, height 46 cm.
Collection of National Museum of Korea.
This Joseon adoption of Neo-Confucianism underscores the powerful influence which China traditionally had on Korea. The geographical location of Korea, lying between China and Japan, fostered much cultural and economic interaction as well as conflicts among these three countries. The devastation wrought on the Joseon kingdom by the Japanese invasions in the late 16th century as well as by the Manchu invasions in the early 17th century was a turning point in Korean history.
Despite these upheavals, Joseon Korea experienced many artistic and scientific advances, especially under the leadership of several strong Joseon kings. Most of these important developments occurred during the 15th and 18th centuries, which are regarded as the two golden ages of the Joseon period. The fourth monarch, King Sejong (reigned from 1418 to 1450), is often regarded as the most outstanding among the Joseon kings. In addition to his social reforms, he sponsored many scientific and cultural projects. He is especially renowned for implementing a new phonetic alphabet in 1446. Initially called Hunmin Jeongeum (Korean for â€œcorrect sounds to instruct the peopleâ€) and better known today as Hangeul, the alphabet project stemmed from King Sejong's desire to provide his people with a written means of expression that could be learned and used with greater ease, instead of the complicated Chinese system.
The King And His Court
As the head of a Confucian state, a Joseon king was expected to possess excellent moral fibre, wisdom and erudition. From a young age, Joseon princes were subjected to a rigorous education in the Confucian classics and history in a bid to become sage-kings. This was especially important as a king's moral stature was thought to affect the stability and success of his rule. This belief was undergirded by the Confucian concept of the Mandate of Heaven, which General Yi invoked to establish the legitimacy of the new Joseon dynasty and his right to rule.
The Confucian emphasis on ritual propriety saw many ceremonies being conducted at the Joseon court. These were collectively referred to as the Five Rites of State and formally instituted in 1474. The Five Rites consisted of auspicious rites (gillye) which included memorial services to past Joseon kings and queens, celebratory rites (garye) which were performed on joyous occasions such as weddings, reception rites (billye) to welcome foreign dignitaries, military rites (gullye), and last but not least, inauspicious rites (hyungnye) that pertained to mourning and funerals. These events allowed the monarchy to project its authority over officials, foreign envoys and the masses, while promoting harmony among the people.
In addition to participating in many of these rites as a representative of the Joseon people, the kings also wielded objects to signify their status and supremacy. Many of these objects such as the Sun, Moon and Five Peaks screens, royal seals, and items of clothing have become key icons of the Joseon period. The vividly-coloured screens depicting the Sun, Moon and Five Peaks (fig. 2) were seen to embody the universe and its cosmic forces. Set behind the royal throne or a king's royal portrait, these screens were associated with kingly power and signified the monarch's presence even when he was physically absent.

Such screen paintings were among the many fine objects sponsored by the king and his court. While some of the iconography were originally restricted for royal use only, certain motifs such as those with auspicious meanings became popular and were used by other members of society during the late Joseon period. For instance, folding screens which depicted books arranged on shelves called chaekgado (fig. 3) are believed to have first appeared at the Joseon court in the late 18th century at the behest of King Jeongjo (reigned from 1776 to 1800), who was known for his great love of books and scholarship. Such screens featuring books, which were sometimes portrayed with scholarly paraphernalia and other valued possessions, were subsequently embraced by scholar-officials as well as the middle classes. The types and designs of other courtly objects such as porcelains and dress ornaments also shaped tastes and trends beyond the palace walls.

Another key group that contributed much to the artistic legacy of the Joseon dynasty were the yangban. They formed the highest social class and constituted the kingdom's intellectual and cultural leaders. The yangban comprised the two orders of civil and military officials serving in the government, as well as their families. The yangban also referred to members of select lineage groups with distinguished ancestors such as prominent scholar-officials. In fact, from the mid-17th century onwards, many yangban no longer worked for the government but resided in the countryside away from the main administrative centres.
Whether they were rich or poor, part of the government bureaucracy or not, the yangban were regarded as the moral pillar of Joseon society. As such, they were expected to devote themselves to the Confucian doctrine of self-cultivation and study. In addition to their pursuit of scholarship, the yangban also devoted much of their energies to calligraphy, painting, music and literature. Many yangban were highly accomplished in the arts of the brush, such as Kang Huian (1417 to 1464) and Kim Jeonghui (1786 to 1856), who were known for their adroitness in painting and calligraphy respectively (figs. 4 and 5).

The adherence to Confucian ideals and its hierarchical values was also translated into the living spaces of the yangban. The emphasis on the dichotomy between genders shaped the spatial arrangement of yangban households, while influencing the type and style of furnishings used in the respective spaces. For instance, the living quarters of both genders were separated, with the men's quarters (sarangchae) located in the eastern section of the residence, and the women's quarters (anchae) to the west. This corresponded with the traditional notion that the east symbolised yang or masculine energy, while the west represented yin or feminine energy.
Moreover, furniture used in the sarangchae and more specifically, the sarangbang (master's room which also served as a study, bedroom and reception hall) were often designed with a minimalist aesthetic (fig. 6). Clean lines and a lack of ornamentation characterised the wooden furniture used in the men's quarters.

Everyday Life Of The Joseon People
While the Joseon landscape was shaped largely by the tastes and patronage of the royal and aristocratic elite, it was also enriched by the vibrant arts cultural and crafts produced for the wider populace.
By the early 16th century, the Joseon kingdom's population had exceeded ten million, nearly doubling the size it had been at the start of the dynastic period. The growth was spurred by improvements in agricultural technology which increased productivity. The capital Hanyang was not only the centre of political life but a major commercial city drawing people from all walks of life and from around the country. The Joseon population was divided into four classes. After the yangban, who enjoyed the highest social status, came the jungin. This referred to people who possessed technical skills or professional knowledge, such as doctors, astronomers and interpreters. Below them were the sangmin or commoners â€“ farmers, artisans, and merchants, who formed the largest segment of the population. At the lowest social stratum were the low-born (cheonin), which included butchers, musicians and courtesans.
The daily lives of all classes became the subject of genre paintings, a major form of Korean art that flourished in the 18th century (fig. 8). The paintings focused on candid depictions of commoners at work and at leisure. The trend was spurred by the growing interest among intellectuals in Korea's native customs and crafts, as well as its agriculture and geography. This developed under the banner of Silhak (Korean for â€œPractical Learningâ€) â€“ a popular movement during the late 17th and 18th century which advocated a practical approach to statecraft.

Joseon Legacies
While Joseon regarded China as the bastion of civilisation in East Asia, and much of its art and culture took reference from its continental neighbour, the kingdom also adapted other foreign influences, and developed its own distinct style and identity. For example, not only were traditional Chinese painting themes reinterpreted by Joseon artists, the 18th century also saw the flourishing of true-view landscape painting that emphasised actual native scenery. Prior to this new movement, Joseon painters tended to portray idealised landscapes drawn from Chinese cultural references or generic images of nature.
Despite the political and economic strife of the 19th century, many of the socio-cultural changes introduced by the Joseon dynasty have enjoyed an enduring legacy. Much of what is considered traditional, as well as the social customs and beliefs that are a prominent part of life in South Korea today, emerged during the Joseon era. Examples include the emphasis on filial piety, as well as respect for seniority and age â€“ both of which characterise social relations in contemporary South Korea. Much of Korea's rich cultural heritage, including its cuisine, architecture, performing, visual and literary arts, and even alphabet â€“ were created during the Joseon dynasty.
1 Written in the mid-15th century, Yongbi eocheonga is the first literary work written in Hangeul. The text praises the virtues and heroic deeds of the first and third king of the Joseon dynasty as well as their ancestors. This particular stanza likens the new dynasty to a tree with deep roots and a spring of deep waters, and predicts its longevity The translation of this poem is from David R. McCann, Early Korean Literature: Selections and Introductions (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000), 125.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 â€“ Jul to Sep 2015
Anyone who tires of the towering glass-steel offices at Raffles City, or the shop-till-you-drop malls along tree-lined orchard road, can head to the west of Singapore and explore a hidden cultural treasure: a dragon kiln. Tucked away at the western end of the island, next to the Nanyang Technological University as of 2015, there are not one but two septuagenarian dragon kilns that transport visitors back in time to a once-thriving pottery industry in Singapore. In the early 1960s, there were about 10 kilns in Jurong producing functional wares, such as earthenware jars and latex cups. The kilns were located in Jurong because of the area's white sedimentary clay, which is well-suited for the production of these wares.
The Early Pottery Industry
From the 1950s to the early 1990s, dragon kilns were central to the pottery industry when earthenware pots were produced using methods such as coiling, throwing and plaster moulding. Other utilitarian wares, such as latex cups for the rubber plantations, and ceramic souvenirs were also red in these kilns. However, the pottery industry declined, and by the mid-1990s, with the demolition of the Sam Mui Kuang dragon kiln at the Jalan Hwi Yoh, the two other kilns in Jurong â€” the Thow Kwang and Guan Huat dragon kilns â€” ceased commercial production. Thow Kwang changed its business model to the import and export of ceramics. The â€œdragonsâ€ went into a slumber.
Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln
Built in the 1940s, Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln is one of only two surviving kilns in Singapore. The other kiln, Guan Huat Dragon Kiln, is located a stone's throw away. The dragon kiln (long yao in Mandarin), is a long hollow semi-circular tunnel made of bricks, and resembles the body of the mythical beast. The kiln was built on a sloping terrain to take advantage of the updraft during the ring process.
The Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln is less than a metre wide in the front chambers, and widens to about two metres at the back. At the back of the kiln is a nine-hole brick damper wall, where the smoke and heat escape via a chimney. At the sides, circular humps of bricks spaced at intervals along the kiln's length support the kiln structure. Visitors enter the 27-metre long kiln through one of the two arched doorways. The doorways are lined with bricks with names like Nanyang, Bee Kiow and Jurong â€” reminders of Singapore's past when factories produced bricks for local use. Alongside the kiln are 17 pairs of stoke holes, where wood is added and the firers monitor the temperature inside during the ring process.
Firing the Dragon
A wood ring can take from 25 to 36 hours or more to complete, and this does not include the time needed to pack and load the pieces in the kiln. Why then would anyone want to use this traditional method to fire clay pieces, when today's commercial electric and gas kilns require much less time and effort?
Many potters yearn for the unique combination of wood ash and salt on their pieces, which gives them a one-of-a-kind result. When using a wood kiln, potters rarely get pieces that are the same. The unpredictability and uncertainty of not knowing how the pieces will turn out gives potters an artistic edge. It is also an experiential process â€” perhaps potters experience a feeling of being transported to the past when they see the burning wood and the glowing flames licking the clay pieces.
Indeed, this unique wood ring experience is achieved only through great effort. Work begins long before the ring. Hours of preparation are needed to set up the kiln shelves and load the pieces into the kiln. Each piece is carried into the kiln and carefully placed on the kiln shelves. The pieces are strategically arranged to ensure a smooth flow of heat and fire through the kiln. Once all the pieces are packed, the stoke holes and doorways are sealed, and the kiln is ready for ring.
A wood ring usually begins in the morning with offerings and prayers at the fire box. Sticks of wood are thrown into the fire box to feed the â€œdragonâ€, and the temperature is slowly raised. As day turns to night, the temperature rises and the heat gets more intense.
Standing in front of the kiln, a person may be overwhelmed by the heat, the glowing flames and the crackling of burning wood in the kiln. The firers, working in shifts, are all flushed and sweaty â€” but the work only gets tougher from here. When the temperature in the kiln finally reaches 800 to 1,000 degrees Celsius, lots more effort and wood are needed to feed the kiln. There are anxious moments when the temperature drops instead of going up, and the firers have to feed more wood into the fire box. Everyone watches the thermocouple readings eagerly to see if the temperature will rise again.
After 12 hours or more, and when the temperature at the fire box reaches 1,250 degrees Celsius, the front pit is sealed â€” amid shouts of relief and joy â€” and the firers move to the stoke holes on both sides of the kiln. The process of feeding the kiln continues. Through the stoke holes, the firers look for the pyrometric cones which bend at a particular temperature, signalling to the firers to move to the next pair of stoke holes. Almost always, salt is thrown into the kiln at this stage. Salt reacts with the silica in the clay body, and this chemical reaction forms an attractive glaze. This continues until each chamber in the kiln is fed. When the last stoke holes are sealed, the remaining glowing embers are left to extinguish as the dragon draws its final breath and is left to cool. The Thow Kwang dragon kiln is red about two to three times a year. To witness or participate in a wood ring process is truly an unforgettable experience.
Firers ensure that the temperature of 1,250 degrees Celsius is reached at each pair of stoke holes before moving to the next chamber.
One-of-a-kind Wood-fired Pieces
The kiln is left to cool, and days later the unpacking begins. This is often a moment of apprehension and curiosity as the potters can finally see the pieces. Each piece is knocked loose from the kiln shelves and carried out to be examined. The uniqueness of a wood-fired piece results from the combination of wood ash and salt that coat the pieces. It is unpredictable, erratic and what gives a wood-fired pot its uniqueness and beauty.
Weekend Clay Experience
On weekends, Thow Kwang dragon kiln is a bustle of activity. In one area, a group of potters are throwing or glazing their work; in another, children and adults are trying their hands at being potters. For a small fee, anyone can have a hands-on experience working with clay, making and ring a small piece to bring home. Sometimes, a throwing demonstration on the kicking wheel by one of the potters can be seen.

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2011
Amid the undergrowth of a lush green forest, the diminutive mousedeer twitched its nose as it picked up a foreign scent. It sensed danger and bounded away in a series of elastic leaps. Nearly tripping over a sleeping python, it regained its composure but turned around to see the yellows eyes of a tiger towering over it. With a terrifying roar, the magnificent beast threatened to devour the mouse deer.
Thinking quickly under pressure, mousedeer said, â€œOh tiger, before you are entitled to eat me, please let me finish my task. I was asked by the king to keep watch over his belt before he returned so that no one would wear it.â€
Puzzled at its demand, tiger demanded to see the belt of the king.
â€œThere it is,â€ said the mousedeer, pointing to the intricately patterned sleeping coil beside it. â€œBut you must not touch or wear it.â€
Piqued by its beauty, the tiger was mesmerised and had the yearning to wear the belt for himself. Ridding all hostile intentions, the tiger requested, â€œMousedeer, could you lend me the belt for a second, only a second?â€
Mousedeer disagreed at first, but relented on the condition that no one must know that it lent tiger the king's belt or it would be in great trouble.
The tiger agreed and waited for the mousedeer to get away, then picked up part of the large snake and wrapped it eagerly around its waist. Rudely awoken and incensed, the python tightened and threw its coils around the tiger till it could hardly breathe. Safe in a distance, the mouse deer had its last laugh.
This old Malay folklore could well have taken place in Pulau Ubin where such wildlife once flourished. In the rolling virgin forests of the boomerang-shaped island northeast of mainland Singapore, once roamed the three animal characters of this story as well as numerous other land animals, birds, fish and invertebrates. Other notable resident fauna included the now possibly nationally extinct cream-coloured giant squirrel (Ratufa affinis) and sambar deer (Rusa unicolor).
These creatures co-existed and were probably hunted by stone-age people and ancient civilisations that settled on Pulau Ubin. Neolithic stone tools, quartz flakes, clay and stoneware artefacts unearthed from the island by archaeologists are testament to the rich and untold history of the island.
Tigers â€“ Fabled Antagonist, Real Life Victim
The other protagonist of the Sang Kanchil story, the tiger (Panthera tigris) used to be â€œstill over-plentiful in Singaporeâ€ in 1895, according to H. N. Ridley, the former director of the Botanic Gardens.
Tigers were said to have swum from Malaysia via Pulau Ubin and the neighbouring island of Tekong to breed on the main island and raise their cubs. It is therefore not surprising that stories of tigers on Pulau Ubin have become told as legends on the island even today.
In one such story, a tiger entered a hut situated along a forest edge. It walked over ashes of a fire, left its mark and finding nothing of interest, broke through the flimsy wall of the hut and went away. The next night, four tigers entered another house nearby, probably looking for a meal of the owner or his dog. The house was left to the tigers as the occupants fled by breaking though the back of the house.
Although feared for its strength and frequently portrayed as the bully in folklore, the king of the jungle did not enjoy its status for long in Singapore. Faced with the loss of habitat to plantations, they turned to humans as food and killed an average of one human being a day. The tiger became a victim of its own fearsome reputation and due to resultant human-tiger conflict the big cats were eventually hunted to national extinction around 1930.
However, tiger sightings were still reported up to the 1950s. In 1997, rumours of a tiger in Pulau Ubin led the police to issue a public advice to keep away from the island. The presence of the tiger was never confirmed and was thought by conspiracy theorists as a ruse by villagers to teach bumboat operators a lesson for raising boat fares!
The Greater Mousedeer: A Tale of Loss and Rediscovery
The diminutive greater mousedeer (Tragulus napu) is a nocturnal forest-dwelling hoofed animal about the size of a large rabbit (shoulder height 30- 35 cm; head body length 52-57 cm). It has features similar to both deer and pigs, and like the former, feeds on fallen fruits and vegetation and has a four-chambered stomach for digestion. However, like pigs, it lacks antlers and has elongated canines, especially in males and hence, is not a true deer. The greater mousedeer is native to Singapore and can also be found in Southeast Asia and Borneo.

Mousedeer used to be fairly common in Singapore before the 1920s but they faced threats such as the loss of their forest habitat and hunting. In Pulau Ubin, the greater mousedeer was recorded based on a single specimen (ZRC.4.4750) collected in 1921 and deposited in the Zoological Reference Collection of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research. Other than two other specimens from the mainland collected in 1908 and 1923, no confirmed record of the species existed in the wild for the rest of the century and they were thought be nationally extinct.
A re-introduction effort for the species on the mainland was made between 1998 and 1999, but released animals were not recorded again after 1999.
Compared to the lesser mousedeer (Tragulus kanchil), which are still present on Singapore island in small numbers and distinguished by their smaller size (shoulder height 20-23 cm; head body length 40-55 cm), throat and coat markings (see Low et al, 2009), the greater mousedeer appeared to be gone from the wild forever.
A twist of fate happened in 2008 when the greater mousedeer was rediscovered in Pulau Ubin during a faunal survey of the island. They appear to be fairly widespread across the island and could have come from a latent population that has recovered in numbers or swam from Malaysia. Both adults and young were seen, indicating that a breeding population exists.
Several possible reasons could have led to the return of the greater mousedeer. First, their reappearance in the forest in numbers is a sign that the regenerating forests of Pulau Ubin are once again able to support the existence of these forest dependent creatures. Second, the decrease in human activity on the island after quarries were closed and many villagers relocated probably provided a less disturbed landscape for the animals to thrive. Thirdly, the mousedeer could have swum from Johor, Malaysia, just as how wild pigs and elephants have made the Johor Strait crossing. Finally, as large mammalian predators such as tigers and leopards are extinct on the island, there is reduced predator pressure on the island which could increase their chance of survival.

Although they have almost literally have come back from the dead, greater mousedeer and mammals on Pulau Ubin still face possible threats outlined in the main story.
However, there is potential for the greater mousedeer to continue to co-exist with man on the island due to the activity pattern of the two groups. Most mammals on the island, including the greater mousedeer, are nocturnal, while majority of human visitors to the island come in the day and do not stay overnight. Hence, it suggests that mammal use of the island is temporally separated from human activity. Additionally, visitorship to the island is higher during the weekends compared to the weekdays. Wildlife on the island may therefore be less disturbed during the relatively quiet periods at night and on weekdays. If well managed, this cyclical difference in activity between wildlife and humans may allow Pulau Ubin to function as both a recreational area for the public as well as a wildlife refuge in the long term and help to ensure the continued existence of the greater mousedeer and other nocturnal wildlife on Pulau Ubin.
Blasts from the Past
The landscape of Pulau Ubin changed, however, following mass human settlement in Singapore. The granite hills of Pulau Ubin (in Malay: Pulau = island, Ubin = granite) were viewed as a valuable resource in building and construction and were extensively quarried from the mid-19th century. Nature made way for man and its machines and deafening blasts could be heard across the island as dynamite was used to blow up and extract granite deposits.
Plantations and aquaculture also changed the island's landscape. Much of the land was cleared for growing rubber, durian, coconut and other crops. Stretches of mangroves were also cleared for aquaculture. Charming mangrove swamps were replaced by unsustainable and pollutive prawn ponds.
As a result, much of Pulau Ubin's original natural heritage was destroyed or disappeared. The land was irreparably scarred and original habitats were lost. Naturalists who ventured onto the island found it to be depauperate of its flora and fauna. Lost and gone were the steep, rolling hills covered with primeval forest as well as many of its inhabitants, including the tiger. These are likely to be lost forever.
A Natural Renaissance
In the late 1990s, when the last of Pulau Ubin's quarries ended their operation, many villagers relocated to the mainland. Slowly, nature recovered and started reclaiming the island like a lost child, spreading its seeds and allowing pioneer grasses and herbaceous plants to take over the fractured landscape. In the untended orchards and plantations, wild plants took root between what remained of commercial crops. This was the dance of natural succession.
As human disturbance reduced and habitats gradually reverted to the wild state, fauna returned. Among the first were birds, which also brought in and dispersed more seeds, aiding in the forest regeneration. Once extinct in Singapore, the oriental pied hornbill (Anthracoceros albirostris) made a comeback on Pulau Ubin and has successfully re-established a population on the island.
Oriental pied hornbills have returned to Pulau Ubin in recent years and can often be seen feeding on fruit trees at Chek Jawa.
Larger animals such as wild pigs (Sus scrofa), which were extinct on the mainland, also made their way by swimming across the narrow Johor Strait from Malaysia and re-colonised the island.
Wild pigs are frequently sighted around Chek Jawa, where they feed on vegetation and fallen fruit on the forest floor.
Even an elephant once attempted the straits crossing, but was escorted back to Malaysia after a brief stay on the island. These visits highlighted the potential of Pulau Ubin as a wildlife refuge as habitats on the island became more hospitable to wildlife.  
In 2001, plans were announced to develop parts of Pulau Ubin, which included the reclamation of the eastern coast of the island. Ironically, these plans led to the serendipitous discovery of Chek Jawa wetlands by the local naturalist and scientific community. Chek Jawa is a wonderful rich mosaic of ecosystems containing a vast seagrass lagoon, healthy mangrove swamps and a diverse shoreline of sandbars, coral rubble and rocky formations at the southeastern tip of the island.
Chek Jawa boardwalk at dawn - a magnificent sight to behold.
Word spread and the place quickly made a name for itself as a must-see location among nature lovers and even the general public, which flocked to Chek Jawa in the thousands.
Some would say Chek Jawa was almost loved to death by the unregulated visitor traffic that trampled on many of the marine creatures such as sea anemones and sea stars. But this widespread exposure to the unspoiled beauty of Chek Jawa was also what helped save the wetlands. Struck by the natural wealth of the place and incredible biodiversity, both cityfolk new to their natural heritage as well as the nature community rallied together and appealed to the government for Chek Jawa to be saved for posterity.
A turning point for local nature conservation and community involvement came in December 2001, when the Singapore government announced that reclamation of the island would be deferred for a decade. The National Parks Board (NParks) then took over the management of the area and developed infrastructure such as an elevated boardwalk above the shore to regulate visitor impact to the fragile ecosystems.
An elevated boardwalk at Chek Jawa allows the public to keep their feet dry while viewing the lush seagrass lagoon and mangrove habitats.
Pulau Ubin Today
Today, Pulau Ubin is one of Singapore's few remaining wild frontiers and among our last rural places. To reach the island, most members of the public take a 10-15 minute bumboat ride from Changi Village and get off at the island's village, where less than 100 families live in kampong houses without piped water and electricity. Instead, the villagers rely on noisy generators for electricity and wells for water. Life on the island is a throwback to Singapore in the 1960s.
Bicycles are available for hire at the village and are the best way to enjoy Pulau Ubin's sights and history.
Beyond the village, after years of recovery and natural succession, Pulau Ubin has become a veritable patchwork of viable habitats. Secondary forest (a term used to describe forests that regenerated on land previously used for agriculture or timber) occupies approximately half the island's land area, while a fifth of it is covered by some of the most extensive mangroves left in Singapore. Small areas of grassland and beach vegetation dot the island, offering variety. The coast is likewise covered with a range of sandy, muddy and rocky beaches.
Displaying fiddler crabs emerge when the tide is low on Chek Jawa's mudflats.
Endowed with a wide assortment of habitats, the island plays host to an amazing range of biodiversity. Over 600 species of plants are found on Pulau Ubin, including the Bakau Mata Buaya (Bruguiera hainesii), an internationally critically endangered mangrove tree. The island is also much loved for its impressive bird life with at least 177 species of native and migratory species recorded. It remains one of the strongholds of the straw-headed bulbul (Pycnonotus zeylanicus), a large songbird that is imperilled by its own rich and melodious singing due to demand by the cage bird trade, and red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), the wild ancestor of the domestic chicken. Other than birds, Pulau Ubin's diversity of mammals, fish, herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians) and invertebrates is equally stunning for a small island.
A Fairytale Ending?
In spite of the good news, possible threats to the island's natural heritage are still present. Pulau Ubin receives relatively high visitorship, especially during weekends, and human disturbance of wildlife could be an issue. Other potential threats include poaching and feral dogs. A proposal to set up an energy grid on the island could bring about street lights, and their placement and usage will have to be properly planned and managed to avoid affecting the activity of nocturnal fauna on the island. Our growing population is also placing constraints on housing on the mainland and offshore islands such as Pulau Ubin may be seen as a land bank for future development which can threaten to erase the island's natural and human heritage.
Still, no matter how grim and even faced with the odds, Pulau Ubin continues to surprise us with its little secrets. While it was thought that the clearing of forests would eradicate forest species, especially mammals sensitive to disturbances, the greater mousedeer (Tragulus napu) was rediscovered on the island in 2008 by the author and NParks during a study of medium-sized mammals of Pulau Ubin. It is an encouraging sign that nature is on the road to recovery as even the greater mousedeer, which had not been seen for more than 80 years and was presumed to be nationally extinct, returned. Other notable fauna recorded during the year-long study include the Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis), wild pig (Sus scrofa), barred eagle-owl (Bubo sumatranus) and large reticulated pythons (Broghammerus reticulatus). Coming full circle, it is comforting to know that at least the mousedeer and python of the Malay folklore still remain.
While we celebrate the miracles of life, there is a need to understand the practicalities of what can be achieved. It is unlikely that Pulau Ubin can ever be restored to its former natural glory. Nevertheless, there is a need to carefully manage and protect what is left. In order to retain our natural heritage on Pulau Ubin, it is necessary to ensure the co-existence of humans and nature. This will require the joint effort of the public as well as stakeholders who appreciate the importance of this shared treasure. Through research and conservation efforts on the island, scientists, NParks and the community can do their part to preserve its natural heritage. With judicious land use planning and the government's assurance that Pulau Ubin will be kept in its present state for as long as possible, there is hope that Pulau Ubin will remain Singapore's urban Eden for time to come.

Singapore and Thailand share close historical ties dating back to the 13th century when Singapore was under the Malay sultanate. The opening of the Kingdom of Siam (now Kingdom of Thailand) to foreign trade from 1855 drew Singapore closer to Siam via trade.
1997 Singapore-Thailand Joint Stamp Issue from Singapore and Thailand.
Singapore received the first royal visit from the Kingdom of Siam when His Majesty King Chulalongkorn made his first overseas visit as king to Singapore in 1871. It was during this period when Siam studied how Singapore, then a British colony, was administered, including its economic and social affairs, as well as the postal system. The advancement of the British postal system in Singapore inspired the Kingdom of Siam to introduce and develop the postal system in Siam. The first post office and stamp issue for Siam was inaugurated on 4 August 1883.
1995, 120th anniversary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs featuring His Majesty King Chulalongkorn.
Singapore â€“ A Postal Hub
Since its establishment as a trading post in 1819 by the British East India Company, Singapore was a postal and communication hub for states and countries in Southeast Asia. All written correspondence from countries in this region with the rest of the world, and vice versa, was done via Singapore. Incoming and outgoing foreign mail to and from Southeast Asian countries were collected in Singapore before being forwarded to their destinations.
Located at the crossroads of international shipping routes, Singapore's unique geographical position placed it in a position to influence the postal arrangements of neighbouring countries â€“ many of which followed this British settlement's postal system closely when introducing new postal systems and extending old ones. The Kingdom of Siam was no exception.
Singapore continued to serve as an important collecting and forwarding hub until late 1800s when its neighbouring countries became members of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). As members of the UPU, which was established in 1874, they were able to send and receive international mail directly to and from foreign countries without having to route their mail to Singapore.
Modernising Siam
Siam was known to be a great entrepot centre in the 17th century. However, its efforts in diplomatic and commercial relations with foreign and Western countries were put to a halt by Burmese invasion in 1767. Although Burma did not retain control of Siam for long, Siam closed its door to the outside world and spent more than a hundred years to restore and reunite the country.
Siam began to resume external contacts during the reign of His Majesty King Nang Klao (Rama III 1824 - 1851). He reopened relations with Western nations and established trade with China. But it was during the reign of His Majesty King Mongkut (Rama IV 1851 - 1868) and later His Majesty King Chulalongkorn (Rama V 1868 - 1910) that Siam underwent tremendous transformation.
Diplomacy, Sovereignty and Modernisation
Faced with the pressure and threat of Western imperialist powers' advances in colonising states and countries around Siam, King Mongkut kept these Western powers at bay by signing treaties with several European countries. United Kingdom was the first to succeed in signing a treaty with Siam in 1855. Signed by King Mongkut and Sir John Bowring, the Bowring Treaty in essence allowed foreigners to trade freely in Bangkok without the heavy royal taxes imposed on trade. The constructive treaty put Siam's foreign relations on a positive note at a time when resistance was met with force. The Bowring Treaty set the tone of non-interference in Siamese affairs and respect for Thai independence, which was also observed by other Western powers.

The Bowring Treaty resulted in an increasing volume of trade between Singapore and Siam. Rice exports formed the biggest part of this trade. With the signing of more treaties with other foreign powers, trade grew by leaps and bounds. For example, ships visiting Bangkok from Singapore more than doubled, from 146 in 1850 to 302 in 1862. The total annual value of trade also rose from about 5.6 million baht in 1850 to about 10 million baht by 1868.
Capitalising on the good relationship with the Western powers, King Mongkut studied their form of government, administration, as well as their social and economic affairs. He undertook many social and economic reforms to modernise Siam.

Singapore â€“ An Inspiration to Siam
Singapore was the British centre in the region. There were many visits between British and Siamese officials. In 1861, King Mongkut sent Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawongse Juang Bunnag and Prince Krommamun Vishnunarth Nibhadhorn to study how Singapore was administered. As a result, modern technology such as the construction of roads and bridges was brought to Siam.
During the start of the reign of King Chulalongkorn, the progress of Singapore, Java and India had deeply impressed the young king. British and Dutch colonial government and administration â€“ not the states in Europe â€“ were his models. There are two main periods of reform during his reign: the first from 1873 to 1874; and the second, after 1892. The reforms were related to his travels to Singapore and Java in 1871 and his subsequent visits to these same places in 1896 and 1901.
In 1881, with a view to establish post offices in the kingdom, an officer was sent to Singapore to gain insight into the postal system. Siam hoped to establish direct postal communication with the rest of the world, and there was no post office in the kingdom at that time.
Introduction of Postal System in Siam
British Consulate in Bangkok
The signing of treaties between Siam and foreign countries allowed these countries to establish their consulates in Siam. The need to communicate via letters and correspondence with other consulates and with their home countries stressed the need for a postal system. At that time, there was no postal service in Siam. The people of Siam sent letters through messengers or friends who were travelling within or out of the country.
Code of Arms of British Consulate in Bangkok used as postal cancellation.
In 1867, the British Consulate was the first entity in Siam to introduce the system of post. With that, all international mailing services were provided by and dependent on the British Consulate.

Straits Settlements Stamps Used in Bangkok
When the British Consulate Post Office was set up in Bangkok, Siam did not have its own stamp. British India stamps, which were also used in the Straits Settlements (Malacca, Penang and Singapore), were used by the British Consulate Post Office until 1867 when they were replaced by Straits Settlements stamps.
During this early period, outbound mail must be sent out from Bangkok to Singapore, and thereafter forwarded to other countries. The letters and packages were thus cancelled in Singapore with Singapore postmarks. This practice continued until 1 July 1885 when Siam joined the UPU which coordinates the international postal system, and started its own international postal services.
Straits Settlements Stamps Overprinted with â€˜B'
In April 1882, the branch of the Singapore post office established in Bangkok was permitted by the United Kingdom to operate postal services in the city, as sending messages was in great demand. The Straits Settlements stamps were overprinted with the Roman alphabet â€˜B', which stood for â€˜Bangkok', the place from where the letters were mailed.

After Siam started operating its own postal services in 1883 and became a member country of the UPU on 1 July 1885, the British postal services in Siam and the use of the stamps printed with the letter â€˜B' were terminated.
Local Stamps for Palace Use
In 1875, when the British Consulate was still offering postal services in Siam, His Royal Highness Prince Bhanurangsi Sawangwongse, King Chulalongkorn's younger brother, published a daily newspaper named â€˜COURT' or â€˜Government News' with a group of the royal family's members. The newspaper was distributed by dispatch to high-ranking officials and close members of the royal family, and Prince Bhanurangsi Sawangwongse issued a stamp as evidence of payment for the delivery service. This stamp, referred to as â€˜Local Stamp', featured a portrait of Prince Bhanurangsi Sawangwongse. They were also used for letters sent to a specific area.

The 'Rising P', a single one-Att stamp was affixed on each copy of the Court Circular as a fee for its delivery within the metropolis' walls, and two stamps were affixed if delivered outside the metropolis' walls.
Following this, Prince Bhanurangsi issued another series of stamps printed in England named â€˜The Royal Family'. It was used only by members of the royal family in communicating government news.
Siamese Postal System
In 1880, Chao Muen Samerjairaj, a courtier who had seen the postal system in foreign countries, made an appeal to King Chulalongkorn to establish a postal system in Siam for the benefits of the general public and the government.
Chao Muen Samerjairat lodged a letter of appeal to His Majesty King Chulalongkorn, requesting for a Royal Decree to establish a postal system in Bangkok.
He said:
â€œIt is important indeed for the trading in accordance with the international practice to know exactly where to receive and send the correspondences, which is called postal service, and this will be beneficial to the nation and other countries as well.â€
On 2 July 1881, King Chulalongkorn appointed Prince Bhanurangsi as Director-General of the Post and Telegraph Department. It was a rather challenging endeavour for the prince, as the postal services were very new in the Siamese society. The registration of house numbers and last names had not commenced at that time. Moreover, a number of people disagreed with the project, fearing that it might not worth the investment.
Inauguration of the Postal System
On 4 August 1883, Prince Bhanurangsi, Director-General of the Post and Telegraph Department, proclaimed the inauguration of postal services, which would be on trial within the area of Bangkok. Letters were accepted and sent within the city.
After 48 days, the overwhelming number of Siamese people using the services at the post office amazed King Chulalongkorn. The king mentioned the postal services in the Royal speech on his birthday on 20 September 1883:
â€œ I had no idea that the Siamese use letters in this huge amount ... Post Office providing the services of receiving and delivering mails within Bangkok surprises me due to the fact that the Siamese use a great amount of letters. This inspired me to expand the service throughout the Kingdom for the benefit of trading and correspondence of government sector. Later, I hope to invite the Director-General of Germany Postal Service and apply for a membership of Postal Union, which will allow for Siamese Postal Service to operate the mailing service around the world.â€
First Stamp Issue in Siam
Siam issued its first set of postage stamps on 4 August 1883. The stamps, known as â€˜Solot', featured the portrait of King Chulalongkorn. Intended for domestic use only, the stamps bore no country name. They were designed by Mr William Ridgeway, an English designer and engraver, and were printed by the Waterlow & Sons Printing C Ltd, England.
Solot, the first stamp issue of Thailand, had six denominations: 1 Solot, 1 Att, 1 Sio, 1 Sik, 1 Salung and 1 Fuang.
When Siam joined the UPU on 1 July 1885, stamps were issued and designed in accordance with the UPU regulations, so that they could be used both within the country and overseas. The word â€˜SIAM' was added and denominations were in both Thai and Arabic numerals.
With these changes, the use of British Straits Settlements stamps for outbound mail was no longer needed. This led to the closure of the British Consulate Post Office in Bangkok.

Queenstown today is known as one of Singapore's oldest housing estates. But back in the day, the housing project was one of the nation's most ambitious, designed to give residents convenient access to all the living amenities that they needed. A guided tour, called My Queenstown Heritage Trail, hopes to take participants on a walk down memory lane by sharing the estate's story through its landmarks and the memories of its earliest residents.
Its story began on 27 September 1953, when British officials from the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) named the new town after Queen Elizabeth II to mark her coronation the previous year. The colony suburb was the most ambitious project initiated by SIT to create a self-contained and financially independent new town with factories, shops, markets, schools and clinics away from the congested downtown â€” but close to residents.

Bounded by Ridout Road, Tanglin Road, Alexandra Road, Holland Road and the Malayan Railway, the satellite town comprised 11,000 flats housing 70,000 people, at a cost of about $80 million â€” a princely sum at that time.
Construction began at the former Buller Camp in Princess Estate and the former Normanton Barracks in Queens' Crescent Estate. The former burial ground and farmland at Boh Beh Kang village (Hokkien: æ— å°¾æ¸¯; No Tail River) were later cleared to make way for public housing. When the Housing and Development Board (HDB) took over from the colonial government's SIT in February 1960, work had begun in three out of the five planned neighbourhoods in Queenstown, namely Neighbourhood one (Princess Estate), Neighbourhood Two (Duchess Estate), Neighbourhood Three (Commonwealth), Neighbourhood Four (Tanglin Halt) and Neighbourhood Five (Queens' Crescent). HDB later added two more neighbourhoods in Neighbourhood Six (Mei Ling) and Neighbourhood Seven (Buona Vista).
A myriad of social institutions were pioneered in Singapore's first satellite town. As a satellite estate, each neighbourhood came with its own amenities while larger facilities such as the library and sports complex were shared by the entire town. In 1956, the first technical school was opened at Queenstown Secondary Technical School to equip future generations of Singaporeans with technical knowledge and skills to carry Singapore through its decade of industrialisation.
In 1963, Singapore's first polyclinic was built along Margaret Drive to provide access to subsidised healthcare. Two years later, the standalone Venus and Golden City theatres were opened to the public. In 1970, the estate's first branch library and sports complex were completed.
Despite the upgrades to the estate, Queenstown's oldest flats were 30 years old by 1980 and soon mirrored the greying of their original occupants. The next generation of residents who grew up in Queenstown moved away, opting for newer estates due to a lack of development in Queenstown and various government restrictions on owning flats in mature estates. Demolition works in the ageing residential estate commenced in the 1990s and 2000s, and many iconic landmarks such as Forfar House, Tah Chung Emporium, Queenstown Japanese Gardens, Queenstown Remand Prison and Margaret Drive Hawker Centre were torn down.
Rejuvenation in Queenstown took the form of the Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), where high-density precincts were envisioned for Queenstown's older neighbourhoods. In June 2014, HDB announced that 31 residential blocks at Tanglin Halt Road and Commonwealth Drive would be redeveloped under SERS.
Retiree Alice Lee, 66, has been living in a three-room at on the 10th storey of Block 33 Tanglin Halt Road since she got married 44 years ago. She remembers her first visit from her grandfather's shophouse at Tras Street to her matrimonial home vividly: â€œI was extremely petrified when I walked out of the lift on the ninth floor. This was my first experience in a high-rise building and I clung onto my husband's shoulder tightly as I inched up to my flat. I dared not open my eyes because I was very afraid of losing my balance and falling over the parapet.â€
Besides the historical landmarks, Madam Lee's recollection of her memories at Tanglin Halt is one of the key highlights in a guided tour of Singapore's first satellite estatereleased in 2015. Organised by the civic group, My Community, and supported by the National Heritage Board and Queenstown Citizens' Consultative Committee, My Queenstown Heritage Trail (Duchess + Tanglin Halt Tour) uncovers poignant stories from generations of residents, shopkeepers and librarians who live, work and play in the estate.
Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Member of Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC (Queenstown Division), says: â€œThis is the first heritage trail in Singapore which introduces the history and heritage of the estate by having residents, shop owners and librarians tell their own stories and personal encounters. Although Queenstown is small in size, our stories are big in heart and soul, and certainly speak volumes of life in the 1960s and 1970s. We are thankful to have been able to collaborate with many different individuals and organisations to bring this interactive Heritage Trail to fruition.â€

Since the birth of contemporary practice in Singapore â€“ signalled by the formation of The Artists Village, 5th Passage as well as the landmark exhibition, Trimurti from 1988 â€“ artists here have been exploring increasingly diverse mediums of creative work. Performance art, site-specific installations, graphic design and interactive media have become popular alongside new incarnations of painting and sculpture. Future Proof presented artworks by 26 exciting young Singapore artists with innovative and original art practices. Their artistic ventures take place from streets to galleries, their concerns local to geopolitical, their materials both found and acquired. The strong and consistent presence of these young Singapore artists in the local and international contemporary art landscape has enlivened the Singapore creative scene and inspired the birth of numerous other self-taught artists in Singapore.
Presented in galleries, corridors and street sides all at the same time, the exhibition drew from the Singapore Art Museum's permanent collection and special new commissions, reinforced with artworks from the personal holdings of respective artists, Future Proof offered a measure on the contemporary art practice of Singapore artists today.
The Notion of â€˜Place'
Singaporean filmmaker Royston Tan's documentary Old Places captures distinctive places in Singapore that are close to people's hearts, so as to preserve memories that are increasingly disappearing from our landscape. â€œBy collecting these images (of old places), it balances the sense of displacement people feel when familiar places disappearâ€1. As such places are filled with meaning, the loss of many of them in the rapidly evolving Singapore landscape is even more deeply felt by people2.
The notion of â€˜place' is a very powerful one. It is the stage and backdrop to all human activity. Given our culturally constructed lenses and frames, it is part and parcel of human activity, experience and communication. Beyond that, however, in the most deeply seated myths and notions of landscape and place is the idea of rootedness â€“ where ideas of home and belonging, of locality and identity, and of the social dangers of change and modernisation exist3, all being intricately and strongly tied to â€˜place'.
The difference between â€˜site' and â€˜place' is that of the quantitative versus the qualitative. Rather than simply measuring the physical world, looking at â€˜place' measures the spiritual, political and moral qualities of a particular area, recording and representing the space and time of how people in that place have lived their lives4.
Landscape is embedded in the practical uses of the physical world as nature and territory. But by further looking at landscape through political and legal contexts, what emerges from specific geographical, social and cultural circumstances is a site for the negotiations of social, economic, and political geographies (of territory, border, exchange), as well as power relationships and subordination. Thus the spatial expression of one living in a particular territory is rooted in subjects such as land and sea, untamed spaces, and urban skylines5.
More than just physical land or the marked territories of a country, the idea of â€˜place' when interlinked with memory, reveals a more abstract quality of a site that could be perceived as its (true) â€œcultureâ€6. To do so would be to â€œexcavate below our conventional sight-level of the physical to recover the veins of myth and memory that lie beneath the surfaceâ€ - to reveal the power of social memory in shaping individual and social identities, as well as its presence in the physical world7, 8.
â€˜Place' thus becomes the site for the performance and expression of identities: a site for identity to negotiate with social, economic, and political geographies.
Through their works, the artists in Future Proof explored some of the contexts that have shaped both the nation's identity and their own â€“ visualising, conceptualising, recording and representing the space and time they live in.
Performance of Identity in â€˜Place'
In 2005, an exhibition titled islanded was organised by the Institute of Contemporary Art Singapore. It featured 12 artists from different island states, focusing on the anxiety of people living in such states.
As the exhibition curators noted, to be â€˜islanded' was not the result of natural forces, but rather of a complex set of political, social and cultural mechanisms9, often intricately linked to nation building.
Early contemporary Singapore art by artists such as Tang Da Wu explored this, particularly with his influential creation Earthworks in 1980. Through this work, Tang tried to capture Singapore's rapidly changing social and economic landscapes through representing the drastic physical changes in Ang Mo Kio â€“ a rural site which was rapidly transformed and urbanised into a public housing area â€“ by hanging linen clothes in gullies.
Future sites of contestation and negotiation in the Singapore landscape will be many, but well-supported by her people, proof that the Singapore identity was (and is) in the making and being performed ever more so.
The red brick National Library Building at Stamford Road, for example, was an institution for many. It housed not only Singapore's first free public library but also countless fond memories. When it had to make way for the Fort Canning Road tunnel leading from Stamford Road to Penang Road, passionate calls were made by Singaporeans to save this red brick building. A letter by Kelvin Wang to The Straits Times' Forum page on 8 December 1998 sparked off a debate that lasted some seven years. Wang wrote:
â€œBras Basah has lost too many unique buildings already, and we should not lose the National Library because it would mean that Singaporeans will not only lose another part of their history, but also a part of what forms their collective memory, which helps make Singapore â€˜home'.â€10
Today, all that remains of the former red brick building are its â€œtwo wretched red pillars standing forlornâ€. Support for this former building, however, stands unwavering. And so is the recognition of that point in Singapore's recent history where a rare moment of civic activism tried to save a landmark building cherished by so many Singaporeans.
One of the few â€˜artist village' enclaves in Singapore, other than The Artist Village in Ulu Sembawang, also had to make way for an economically-driven project, the integrated resort and casino on Sentosa12. What was one of the few tranquil sites in Singapore for artists to creatively practise their craft is now home to hotels, a casino, and a theme park; but not before a group of artists including Milenko Prvacki, David Chan and Max Kong fought to keep the village alive.
The Sea
An island, by definition, is completely surrounded by sea. This characteristic and Singapore's geographical location have been featured as two key reasons for the island's development from its origin as a fishing village founded by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, to the global port and metropolis it is today. Being an island, Singapore's true territorial boundaries lie not on land but in our surrounding coastal waters. Such characteristics make the maritime territory a site of negotiation and performance of identity for Singaporeans.
The island of Pedra Branca (white rocks in Portuguese) is one such site, located in the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait between the Malaysian state of Johor and the Indonesian island of Bintan. In 1980, Singapore lodged a formal protest in response to a map published by Malaysia claiming Pedra Branca. During the trial at the International Court of Justice between the two countries in November 2007, the issue of defining a country's sovereignty and right to rule were debated heatedly, especially in the vast and indeterminate space of sea territory.
Inside Outside (2005) by Charles Lim attempts to encapsulate this. Lim's photographs of water border markers taken around Singapore waters over a period of one week represent the real border of the nation, despite water around and under it flowing in and out. Especially for an island state, the defining boundaries of the nation's territory out at sea, he puts forth, does not just signal where its sovereignty ends â€“ it also denotes the border that represents the line between belonging and foreignness; and the ever changing ebb and flow, too, of the nature of identity that is constantly in a state of flux.

Displaced (2003) by Francis Ng, is a set of photographic prints of water taken up close, abstract and seemingly universal, focusing on its relationship with the horizon. The photographs were taken at cardinal points in Singapore, with the artist immersing himself in water to capture each shot. The fluidity of one's relationship with the surroundings, occasionally with the threat of being engulfed, similarly puts forth the tension, fragility and sometimes confrontation of one's ever evolving identity and place in the world.
The City
Another site of negotiation is the city itself. Developed rapidly since the nation's independence in 1965, the swift urbanisation and modernisation of Singapore have transformed her physical landscape from kampong villages into a vast concrete jungle of imposing high-rise modernist architecture. Taking place over several decades, this transformation â€“ like many modern cities today â€“ has proven to be traumatic to the city's inhabitants. Even after the dust settles and the skyscrapers take over the landscape, this site of negotiation becomes even more contested14.
The newly designated Marina Bay district, where the skyline is dominated by the distinctive shapes of the Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands integrated resort, adds to the Singapore skyline that already boasts of symbols of economic success such as the banking and financial centres. The Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer have also become sites of negotiation for the Singapore identity, with the pursuit of economic agenda and spirit of pragmatism running up against the moral and the social15, to the point of some Singaporeans comparing this to giving up the Singapore soul and moral fabric16, 17. The debate was fierce and heated, with the focus on bringing in tourists and high net worth individuals to boost the economy dominating all other arguments. If anything, the issue showed a newfound spirit of expressing one's identity and place at the national level, which were acknowledged by journalists and ministers alike18.
Chun Kaifeng's sculptures Â¥ Â¤ $ (2010) and The Ride of a Lifetime! (2010) are expressions of the heated debates surrounding this new entertainment district in Singapore. Â¥ Â¤ $, with its currency symbols, spells out the chorus of anticipation of money to be earned. And the paint splashed on its back is not unlike the marks made by loan sharks on the doors for their defaulting borrowers. Instead of the thrill and joy associated with most amusement park rides, The Ride of a Lifetime! gives the impression of a prison and a sense of melancholy. The monochromatic models â€“ while deliberately made to be reminiscent of toys and playthings from childhood â€“ contain rather sharp social critique, conveying the strong need for freedom and individuality in a dispassionate society.
Playing with the notions of truth and what the eye really sees is what Donna Ong's installation, Crystal City (2009), is about. The installation, made up of inverted everyday glassware, is magically transformed into a city skyline, a metaphor for great cities like London and New York where anyone with a dream â€˜can make it big'. This beauty, however, comes with fragility and danger as it can all crash quite easily and quickly.

The Decline of Western Civilization (After Penelope Spheeris) (2010) by Gerald Leow, in addition, questions what authentic culture is in a synthetic and constantly evolving world.
Nature
Describing Singapore's pristine orderliness and highly controlled state, many â€“ including government officials and bodies â€“ have used the metaphor of the well-tended garden versus the wild rainforest, with the bonsai plant often being used as the ideal state to reach towards. Kwok Kian Woon's essay on The Bonsai and the Rainforest: Reflections on Culture and Cultural Policy in Singapore noted the price for this order and structure â€“ â€œsocial disciplining through a system of policing and punishmentâ€19. Just as how Singapore's luxuriant greenery in the urban landscape is â€œno accidentâ€, neither is her success today: â€œA good gardener, with all good intentions, curbs the growth of weeds and tends to the health of the plants; in some cases to protect saplings from the elements.â€
The physical, natural landscape (on the decline in Singapore) has come to represent the tussle between an organic situation versus one that is state-controlled and pruned. The lush, diverse (and wild) rainforests of the tropics (used as a metaphor for multiculturalism by the late Kuo Pao Kun) contrast against the bonsai, which is the â€œend product of Will versus Natureâ€ â€“ the product of a controlled growth to represent an ideal aesthetic view of nature20. Amid the orderly, nature and the wild outdoors has become a site for Singaporeans to express themselves against the structured concrete garden they live in, even if it is filled with creepy crawlies and wild things.
The accidental and spontaneity in the wild can be seen in Ang Soo Koon's YOUR LOVE IS LIKE A CHUNK OF GOLD (2011) and Melissa Tan's Under The Blanket of Bedrock (2011). Both works speak of events that happen out of chance, transforming the everyday into something extraordinary. Tan's paper sculptures speak of how undue pressure can transform rocks into crystals; while something comforting and familiar like bread becomes the unusual site for growth of crystals in Ang's bread and crystal sculptures. But the wild does hold its horrors for those brought up in a well-manicured bonsai garden, as Ang's work, along with Genevieve Chua's After The Flood (2010) series of photographs, convey. The spontaneous growth of crystals on bread is sharp and menacing, no matter its beauty; while Chua's hand-painted photographs of secondary forest sites21 in Singapore conveys the fear of the unknown beneath the surface and what lies beyond the manicured lawn.

Beyond Documenting and Representing
The works by the artists in Future Proof went beyond merely documenting and representing. By taking measure of the world rather than just measuring it, these artists have tried to include the remembered, the imagined, and the contemplated; capturing the spiritual, political, moral and social elements of identity.

BeMuse Volume 5 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2012
The Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG), arguably the Republic's most important intact historic site, is living and growing in many ways.
In 2011/2012, SBG recorded more than four million visits, making it the world's most popular botanic gardens. On 13 April 2012, the gardens was conferred the inaugural International Garden Tourism â€“ Garden of the Year Award by the Canadian Garden Tourism Council, for providing visitors with enjoyable and unforgettable world-class garden experiences.
SBG, however, is not just about numbers and awards. Its history is significant for Singapore, the Southeast Asian region, as well as the many individuals whose memories and daily experiences have been enriched by the gardens' green oasis.
The Beginning
SBG is sometimes claimed to have its origins dating from Sir Stamford Raffles' time in Singapore (1819 - 1823), but this is incorrect. Two early attempts to establish a botanic garden beside Fort Canning (formerly known as Government Hill) had failed.
The first, developed by Sir Stamford Raffles himself, was an initial success. It became an ambitious 19-hectare estate by 1823, focusing on the introduction of spices, especially nutmeg and cloves, and had effectively started off a lucrative trade for the island. The garden, however, was abandoned in 1829 due to the lack of official support.
In 1836, a small part of Sir Stamford Raffles' former garden was revived by an agri-horticultural society to focus on the lucrative nutmeg production business. But this was again abandoned a decade later when the crop's market value declined.
The present SBG's Tanglin site was a new start in November 1859. Led by the charismatic Hoo Ah Kay (â€˜Whampoa'), another agri-horticultural society negotiated a land swap deal with the colonial government, acquiring 23 hectares of abandoned plantation. The land included a six-hectare block of intact rainforest, which is a key in situ (natural) conservation area today to protect a diverse range of species in their native habitats.
Further land swaps and acquisitions were made in 1866. Lawrence Niven, a local nutmeg planter of Scottish descent recruited in 1860 to develop the gardens, was thereafter provided with a colonial style bungalow (today's Burkill Hall) on a hill overlooking the entire site. This accommodation, completed in 1868, caused the agri-horticultural society to fall into debt. In 1874, the society petitioned for the colonial government to take over the site's management.

Originally planned as a leisure garden and ornamental park exclusively for the agri-horticultural society's members, the garden grounds were not generally open to the public prior to 1875.
The handing over of the site's management to the colonial government marked a turning point for the gardens, with its purpose and accessibility changed in 1875. Specifically, it became a typical British colonial establishment, focusing on plant research and public recreation.

Earliest Attractions
The Bandstand was one of the earliest attractions created in the SBG. First laid out in the early 1860s and situated at the highest point of the site at that time, it was a focal point of the gardens' original landscape design. The present octagonal structure was built in 1930, and was the stage for early evening performances by military bands for many years. While no longer used for music performances today, the Bandstand continues to be one of SBG's best-known features.

The Swan Lake, added to the gardens in 1866, also continues to be a key feature in today's SBG. Its landmark island with the big clump of elegant nibung palms has become a timeless facet of the gardens' landscape. Besides offering scenic vistas, the lake serves as an important source of water supply for the gardens.

The Palm Valley was developed in 1879 after the colonial government took over the site's management. Today's Palm Valley is home to more than 220 species of palms, and is perhaps the most strikingly beautiful element of SBG's landscape.

SBG'S Former Administrators
The history and development of SBG is tightly intertwined with the history and efforts of its many dedicated administrators since the 19th century.
James Murton, SBG's first administrator under the colonial government's management, started the Herbarium, which laid the foundations for scientific research on flora in the Malay Peninsula and beyond. Today in 2011, the Singapore Herbarium is housed in an underground vault and provides a home to some 700,000 dried specimens, of which 8,000 are known as â€˜Types'. â€˜Type' specimens are reference points for accurate identification of plant species, making the Herbarium a place of pilgrimage for scientists from around the world. While the Herbarium is not for public access, some examples of herbarium specimens can be viewed by the general public at SBG's Library of Botany and Horticulture, Public Reference Centre.
In 1880, Nathaniel Cantley, SBG's second administrator under the colonial government's management, planted the first Rain Trees at SBG. The specimen at Nassim Gate today may be one of these originals. This Central American species of Rain Trees is now seen throughout Singapore, providing the much needed shade and relief in the country's hot tropical weather.

Particularly notable was Henry Nicholas Ridley, who was appointed SBG's Director in 1888. Ridley was, by any measure, a truly exceptional individual. He worked tirelessly for 23 years and ushered SBG into the 20th century, which was the most productive period in the gardens' history. During the 1890s and early 1900s, Ridley devised successful propagation methods and discovered a way to harvest commercial quantities of rubber latex without harming or killing the trees. His name was synonymous with rubber as he had single-handedly convinced Straits Settlements' planters to plant the crop, transforming the region's agricultural economy with seeds produced in the SBG.

Ridley also promoted oil palm, and some of his stock plants can still be seen today between the Healing Garden and the Garage at the SBG.

Like his predecessors, Ridley was interested in orchids. In 1893, he identified a new orchid hybrid and named it Vanda â€˜Miss Joaquim', which has subsequently become Singapore's national flower. Ridley also planted the sealing wax palms, now the brand logo of SBG and seen in many parts of the gardens.
Another notable SBG Director was Eric Holttum, who took charge in 1925. Holttum succeeded in developing a new segment of the horticulture industry. This time it was orchids, achieved in the laboratory instead of the plantation (with Holttum Hall being his laboratory). Today, Holttum's laboratory method is used universally for orchid propagation and the raising of hybrids. It has become a major industry in Southeast Asia, and one which the region is famous for.

SBG since World War Two
While the SBG was left largely intact during the Japanese Occupation, an addition â€“ though not well known â€“ is the flight of brick steps down to the Plant House. The bricks and steps were constructed by prisoners of war, which were revisited by some Australian veterans in 1995.
Driven since 1956 by the ever popular naming of VIP orchids for foreign and local dignitaries, SBG has become a significant source of new hybrids. Outstanding hybrids have been cultivated in the gardens, which have received recognition worldwide. Today, around 1,000 hybridisations are carried out each year. Some examples of these can be seen in the VIP section of the National Orchid Garden beside Burkill Hall.

From the 1960s onward, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew pushed forward his vision on the greening of Singapore. SBG took a central role in this process, experimenting with plants, training gardeners in horticulture and landscaping, and planting up parks and roadsides. The â€˜special park', however, continues to be SBG; not least from the 1990s when it was enhanced in many ways by the visionary Director, Dr Kiat Tan (Gardens by the Bay is his latest brainchild).
SBG's landscape is unrivalled for its beauty and timeless tranquillity, yet only 10 minutes' walk from Orchard Road. As Singapore progressed towards its 50th anniversary in 2015 and evolved from a â€˜Garden City' towards the vision of a â€˜City in a Garden', SBG was an anchor point given its rich colonial history and its many achievements.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 3 - Oct to Dec 2015
To celebrate Singapore's 50th birthday, Singapore Philatelic Museum has curated a special exhibition of stamps, philatelic materials and artefacts.
Stamps are more than tiny pieces of colourful gummed paper used for postage. They are the pride of a nation, reflecting the rich and diverse facets of a country.
Since Singapore became a Republic in 1965, every stamp issue, starting from its first in 1966, has chronicled the nation's journey. The stamps showcase Singapore's political, economic and social development; vibrant multiracial arts and culture; flora and fauna; and links with the world.
Affixed on millions of letters and postcards, stamps are also ambassadors that bring the Singapore Story to all corners of the world.
In 2015, at a special philatelic exhibition to celebrate the Jubilee year of independence, original stamp artworks took their place as stars of the show. Most of them were on display for the first time.
First Stamp as a Republic of Singapore
On August 9, 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became an independent Republic. As the separation came about suddenly, there was a one-year delay in the issuance of the first stamp. The different elements in the stamp highlight the important issues of the period â€” unemployment and workforce, public housing and industrialisation. It is the only stamp issue that states â€œRepublic of Singaporeâ€.

First Definitive Stamps
These are four of the 15 stamps from the first definitive stamp collection since independence. The stamps feature cultural performances from the Malay, Chinese and Indian races. With racial unrest having occurred just four years earlier, these stamps were a timely and deliberate reminder that racial harmony would always be a cornerstone of the new Republic.

150th Anniversary of Founding of Singapore
Mr Lee Kuan Yew took office in 1959 when the People's Action Party won 43 out of 51 seats in the General Election. He served as the first Prime Minister from 1959 to 1990. He remained in service for another 20 years as senior government advisor.

Housing the People
Singapore today has one of the highest home ownership rates in the world in contrast to the 1950s and 1960s, when thousands of people were cramped in slums and squatter settlements under appalling and unsanitary living conditions. Mr Lim Kim San became the first chairman of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) in 1960. Things began to change. An accelerated low-cost housing programme was initiated, coupled with the Home Ownership Programme.

National Service and the Use of Lion Head Symbol
This set of stamps commemorates the 20th anniversary of National Service. Introduced on March 17, 1967, over 9,000 young men born in the first six months of 1949 were conscripted for National Service. This was seen as an effective way to build a defence force without further draining the country's resources.

This stamp issue also featured the Lion Head symbol for the first time. It has since been a permanent feature for every stamp issue.
Keeping Our Taps Running
As Singapore became urbanised and the population grew, the demand for water increased. Fearing that the taps might run dry, Singapore expanded and diversified its water resources. Today, Singapore has 17 reservoirs, 32 rivers and 8,000 km of drains and canals to collect and channel rainwater for consumption and use. This was made possible by cleaning the waterways and rivers. The success of cleaning the Singapore and Kallang Rivers led to another ambitious water project â€” the Marina Barrage.

Greening Singapore
Flora and fauna have been a recurring theme in Singapore's stamps, emphasising the importance of Singapore as a green city. In 1963, Mr Lee Kuan Yew started the greening movement by planting a Mempat tree at Farrer Circus. The aim was to distinguish Singapore from other cities in its drive to industrialise and urbanise as the nation moved from Third to First World. Since 1971, there has been an annual Tree-Planting Day.
Sports Binds the Nation
When Singapore hosts major international sports events like the latest 28th SEA Games, Singaporeans throng the National Stadium at Kallang to cheer on the home contingent. Like all the previous SEA Games (the first in 1973 was known as SEAP Games) that Singapore hosted, the atmosphere for the last SEA Games was described as electrifying with all-out home support for the athletes.

Conserving Our Heritage
In the race to build a modern nation in the 1960s and 1970s, much of the built-up areas in the city had to be torn down. The Urban Redevelopment Authority was set up in 1974 to plan land use and conservation. It applies the â€œ3Râ€ Principle for conservation: Maximum Retention, Sensitive Restoration and Careful Repair. As of 2015, more than 94 conservation areas have been documented resulting in 7,000 buildings receiving conservation status.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 3 - Oct to Dec 2015
For centuries, people have shaped the singapore river with legends, stories and accounts ranging from the everyday to the fantastic, and in turn had their memories shaped by the river. The singapore river walk organically ties these elements together for an unforgettable experience of the river where it all started.
The question has been mused upon before, but remains pertinent. If the Singapore River could speak, what stories might it tell? Of the ancient majesty of Temasek, the earliest travellers from across the globe, the flocks of trading ships or the multitudes of immigrants looking to build a better life in nascent nineteenth-century Singapore?
The river has always fired the imagination: From the Orang Laut, venerating a rock in the river's mouth shaped like a swordfish to avert misfortune when navigating the treacherous waters, to the enduring mystery of the yet-to-be deciphered Singapore Stone, through to the river's renewal and redevelopment in the 1980s, symbolising the will and progress of modern Singapore.
In this light, the Singapore River Walk by National Heritage Board, launched on October 6 in 2015, is simply a manifestation of the ways in which we celebrate the river.
The trading settlement of Temasek, existent by the fourteenth century and attested to in Chinese and Javanese accounts as well as the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), was located around the Singapore River. With its centuries-deep history, the river is archaeologically one of the richest areas on the island.
The latest excavation, conducted in 2015, found imperial-grade porcelain from the Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644), artefacts from the earlier Song (960 to 1279) and Yuan (1271 to 1368) dynasties, Buddhist figurines and gold coins from regional polities.
In 1819, the British landed on the south bank of the river and founded a trading post, which grew into a settlement and gradually into the city of modern Singapore. The earliest British settlement paralleled the boundaries of old Temasek, a point noted by the second colonial Resident, John Crawfurd, as he explored the crumbling ancient city walls still evident in 1822.

In early colonial Singapore, the Collyer Quay area was something of an afterthought. The city centre was further up at the Singapore River and Raffles Place where trading houses, godowns and merchants clustered around the diverse goods ferried in by visiting vessels. Defined in relation to this hive of trading activity, Collyer Quay was a shoreline known in Hokkien as Tho kho au (Behind the godowns).
That all changed after 1864, when the shore was reclaimed and a seawall built even as the Singapore River was becoming congested with boat traffic. Within a few years, Collyer Quay was studded with shophouses and trading offices, out of which merchants scanned the sea for arriving ships with telescopes. The quay, named after Colonel George Chancellor Collyer of the Madras Engineers, was also the first sight of Singapore many immigrants took in from aboard their ships.

This paved the way for development on a grander scale in the early twentieth century, as neoclassical commercial buildings grew in tandem with the tides of commerce. Author and historian Julian Davison remembers: â€œHere were 1920s blockbusters: Ocean Building, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Union Building and the Fullerton Building, so mammoth because of their cutting edge, lighter reinforced concrete frames and artificial stone cladding. Brilliant from afar was the bank's cathedral glass, where the female figure of Commerce reigned over ships... Flanking either end, the skyscrapers of Asia Insurance Building and the Bank of China were gigantic legs soaring to the clouds...â€ These developments presented an imposing waterfront vanguard and drew comparisons with Shanghai's well-known Bund.
Today, colonial-era buildings that survived include the Fullerton Building (the former General Post Office, once â€œthe most important post office in the eastâ€, according to the Polish writer Joseph Conrad) and the former Asia Insurance Building.
In Collyer Quay, areas bestowed with conservation status today are Clifford Pier, Customs House, and Change Alley Aerial Plaza, which connects the pier area with Raffles Place.
Clifford Pier and Customs House
Clifford Pier, c. 1970.
Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
As a gateway for travellers and sailors, Clifford Pier was as colourful a place as you'd expect. Opened in 1933 to replace Johnston's Pier (constructed in 1856), Clifford Pier continued the tradition of being lit with red beacons, as was the case with the previous pier.
This earned the pier and the surrounding area the colloquial name of Ang teng (red lamp in Hokkien) and equivalent names in Malay and Cantonese. The column-free Passenger Hall of the pier features Art Deco detailing, including ribbon-like arched trusses on the roof and stylised sunrays on the entrance arch.
A multitude of boats including tongkangs, twakows, jongs, sampans, bumboats and ferries thronged Clifford Pier, taking passengers to ocean-going vessels further offshore, other coastal parts of Singapore or to nearby islands. Shipping and insurance agents, suppliers, sailors and their families, as well as the call girls euphemistically referred to as â€˜Coca-Cola girls', also made their way onto ships via Clifford Pier.
This made for a bustling atmosphere, with stalls where coffee and teh tarik could be had for 10 cents and where your sup kambing might have been seasoned with illicit ganja.
Magdalene Boon remembers: â€œSitting on a bench at Clifford Pier, watching the embarking and disembarking of human flotsam and jetsam, from the ever-busy sampans [and] motor launches, was the highlight of the week for me. I love the smell of the sea and listening to all the foreign tongues wagging accompanied by the frantic hand gestures. [It] never [failed] to amaze me [how] people communicate, be it illiterate or not!â€
Until the 1970s, koleks and other traditional watercraft converged on Clifford Pier during festive occasions for regattas of boat races, displays of sailing skills and other games. Piloted by villagers from Pasir Panjang and outlying islands including Pulau Seking and Pulau Semakau, these boats and their adroit handlers represented a maritime heritage that stretched back centuries.
Ismail recalls: â€œThere were so many types of different [handmade] Malay wooden boats all skillfully carved and painted with bright colours from the Southern Islands and even the Indonesian islands too. There was much rivalry!â€
Next to Clifford Pier is Customs House, where the 300-strong Harbour Division of the Customs Department once kept watch over Singapore's waterfront. From here, officers locked on to ship-to-shore smuggling of dutiable goods such as liquor and tobacco, and contraband including narcotics.
Of a more sinister nature was human trafficking â€” Geraldene Lowe remembered Customs officers telling stories of how â€œsampans would glide into Clifford Pier in the dead of night with special cargo â€” hot items were opium and girls!â€ To intercept the smugglers, Customs officers would patrol the waters with speedboats and launches.
Boat Quay

Boat Quay was the vital artery that kept the famed entrepot trade of early Singapore owing, but things could have turned out very differently if the first British Resident William Farquhar had had his way. Farquhar favoured Kampong Glam for the location of the settlement's business district, while Sir Stamford Raffles was determined to site the district around the Singapore River, even though most of the land there was swamp, unusable without major reclamation.
Raffles won the day in the debate, and what was to become Boat Quay and Raffles Place formed the site of Singapore's first land reclamation project between 1822 and 1823. Labourers were paid one rupee a day to level the small hills, on which a number of huts occupied by Chinese planters stood, and fill in the surrounding swampland. The earth from the levelled hills was also used to create embankments around the river, creating Boat Quay, while the land formerly occupied by the hills became Commercial Square and later Raffles Place.
The riverine trade enabled by the development of Boat Quay grew rapidly, spawning evocative place names such as the crescent-shaped â€˜Belly of the Carp' stretch near the river mouth, and early merchant Alexander Laurie Johnston's Tanjong Tangkap, advantageously located to snap up the most lucrative goods.
Raffles' declaration of Singapore as a free port saw junks from China, Siam and Indochina arriving with silk, porcelain, rice and opium, while prahus from the Indonesian islands hauled in coffee, spices and gold dust, their merchandise displayed from the sides of their ships to attract the gaze of the merchants in their shophouses and godowns along Boat Quay. The captains made the trip home laden with ironware, opium, steel, guns, cotton and other goods.
Reminiscing about his childhood in the 1950s, Chia Hearn Kok says: â€œWhen the tide of the Singapore River was at its highest...you would find me joining the many boys playing in the flooded streets and swimming in the river. We would be in our short pants and bare-bodied...our heads were always above water because of the stench from the animal and human waste and the rubbish. One of our favourite antics was to catch a ride to the Elgin Bridge on the heavily loaded tongkangs [vessels] that plied the river by climbing on to the rubber tyres on their sides.â€
Jenny Lum remembers a typical scene of the 1960s: â€œAs my dad was a spice and rice merchant, we lived in Synagogue Street shophouses that have now all been demolished. When the goods arrived in the big tongkang, the head of coolies called the kepala will put a long wooden plank against the tongkang and the coolies will walk up the plank one at a time with a piece of cloth cushioning their shoulder and carry down one gunny sack at a time...they were being paid on the number of sacks cleared.â€
Boat Quay's days of river trade ended in the 1980s, and the river underwent an epic clean-up that involved multiple government agencies and the personal intervention of our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The river and its surrounding areas had been polluted from the days of colonial Singapore. Perhaps the earliest clean-up had occurred when Farquhar ordered the removal of hundreds of human skulls, the remains of the victims of ancient piracy, from the beaches.
By the 1980s, the waterway was choked with refuse, dead animals, food and industrial waste, with the inevitable accompanying stench. The 10-year clean-up saw the removal of pollutive trades around the river from Boat Quay to Robertson Quay, dredging of the banks and riverbed, and the clearance of tonnes of rubbish. Pre-war shophouses were conserved and Boat Quay is today a dining and nightlife destination.
Raffles Place, Change Alley and Market Street
Raffles Place stands today as the heart of Singapore's financial district, a towering sweep of steel and glass monuments to the power of commerce. Known as Commercial Square before its renaming to honour Raffles in 1858, the area quickly assumed its role as a business hub, where merchants and ship captains flocked to for news, business intelligence and gossip.
As the commercial stakes grew ever higher, so did the buildings of offices, company headquarters and banks. They reach upwards, evolving into the familiar skyscrapers of the present. Some of the renowned buildings of the past included the Chartered Bank Building, where the Standard Chartered Bank Building now stands, the Mercantile Bank on the site of today's Raffles Place Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, and the United Overseas Bank where UOB Centre currently is.
Raffles Place also catered to retail customers. Household name department stores Robinson's and John Little both started here, while jewellers BP de Silva, textiler Gian Singh and the Honeyland Milk Bar were well-patronised. Paul Kuah recalls: â€œMy siblings used to bring me down to Raffles Place in the 1960s to shop at Robinson's and John Little. In those days, it was always a high point in my life and I recall the old Chartered Bank building, with the friendly Sikh security guard standing outside during the day and who would sleep on his charpoy in front of the bank's door by night.â€

Those were mainly upmarket establishments that stocked goods for European tastes. Away from the department stores, a bustling bazaar could be found at Change Alley between Raffles Place and Collyer Quay, with shops that thrived on bargaining. These drew locals, tourists and sailors, among others, with their diverse array of goods.

From the early 1800s, Market Street and Chulia Street held a significant Indian presence with migrants establishing trading firms, shops of all stripes, and eateries. The many kittangi (warehouse shops owned by the merchant financier Chettiars) on Market Street gained it the Tamil name of Chetty theruvu (Chettiar's Street).
A Multi-faceted Walk
These storied sites are just a taste of the many locations to explore around the Singapore River. Included in the river walk are others like Clarke Quay with its former canneries, ice houses and godowns owned by towkays (wealthy businessmen) like Tan Tye and â€œWhampoaâ€ Hoo Ah Kay. The trail also features the River House, one of only two traditional Chinese houses remaining in Singapore, and the former Thong Chai Medical Institution, where free medical treatment saved the lives of thousands of coolies.
The bridges that span the river, including Singapore's oldest Cavenagh Bridge, paint a picture of changing times in their own right and warrant a visit. The walk also takes in Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka, the oldest mosque in Singapore, and Tan Si Chong Su Temple, which used to face the former river island of Pulau Saigon.
Explore these locales on the Singapore River Walk to encounter the lesser-known, but equally fascinating, places along the Singapore River, and you might just uncover another facet of an ever-evolving story.

BeMuse Volume 5 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2012
A section of the Gold Rush: Treasures of Ukraine exhibition was devoted to exploring the history and significance of gold in Singapore to draw interesting parallels and points of comparison with the travelling Ukrainian collection. Just as the theme of cross-cultural interaction and influence is evident in the various styles and techniques found in the Ukrainian collection, the story of gold in Singapore is inextricably linked to the broader Southeast Asian context and the migration of cultures and traditions, especially since the 19th century.
The earliest-dated archaeological finds in Singapore may be traced to the 14th century, when Singapore was a settlement under the influence of and most probably ruled by the Majapahit kingdom. The Javanese Kala-head design on the gold armlet found at Fort Canning Hill attests to this. While the armlet remains on permanent display at the National Museum of Singapore's Singapore History Gallery, other examples of classical Javanese gold jewellery and ornaments were on display at the Gold Rush: Treasures of Ukraine exhibition. These pieces, as well as other Southeast Asian gold pieces, were drawn from the Asian Civilisations Museum's collection to supplement the National Museum of Singapore collection on display. Collectively, these artefacts help establish the important regional context that shaped the formation and development of Singapore's material culture.
Since the 19th century, Singapore's rapid growth as a colonial port city resulted in a confluence of local and migrant cultures. The use of gold by different communities that began settling in Singapore illustrates this well. While tastes and preferences varied, gold was commonly appreciated for its economic and symbolic value. It was also the precious metal of choice for jewellery made especially for important life events, such as weddings and birthdays. A selection of Malay, Indian and Chinese jewellery, some of which used for such special occasions, were on display at the exhibition. In addition, the Peranakan gold jewellery on display introduced another fascinating angle in terms of the hybrid of influences on its style, mirroring the rich and complex multiculturalism that so characterises Singapore society today.
Gold also featured strongly in the celebration of milestones in Singapore's history, through the use of the precious metal in commemorative coins and medals to convey the occasions' enduring significance. Such commemorative items include the 150-dollar gold coin issued in 1969 on the 150th anniversary of Singapore's founding, and the pendant medallion for the Mayoral Chain of Office to mark Singapore's city status conferred in 1951. Both pieces are historically significant: the former was the first gold coin issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency and minted by the Singapore Mint, while the latter was commissioned by the Chinese community in Singapore but rejected by Singapore's then-Mayor Ong Eng Guan, who banished it together with the Mace of the City of Singapore, which he termed a â€œcolonial relicâ€.
The story of Singapore gold, however, is not complete without an understanding of the history of the goldsmith craft and the many goldsmith shops that populated areas like South Bridge Road from the early 20th century onwards. Both subjects were explored at the exhibition, with an emphasis on the process of local gold-work and the unique culture of buying and selling gold in Singapore. It thus becomes clear that while the universal appeal of gold is evident in both the Ukrainian collection and the Singapore selection, its unique place in each culture and history cannot be overstated.
The earliest gold found in Singapore was of Javanese origin, attesting to Singapore's pre-modern beginnings as a 14th century settlement under the Majapahit empire. This ear pendant is crafted to depict the Shankha, the conch shell-shaped emblem of the Hindu god Vishnu.

The medallion features the coat of arms of the City of Singapore, and the motto â€œMajulah Singapuraâ€ (Onward Singapore), which has since been adopted as the title of Singapore's national anthem.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 â€“ Jun 2017
Story of the Forest is an immersive, larger-than-life digital installation, which initiates multi-faceted dialogues with visitors. The artwork touches on various histories â€“ that of the site it is presented in, as well as the muses it features. The interactive installation bridges conversations between Singapore's colonial past and its present-day modernity by means of a visual and virtual landscape, which provides an alternative lens through which to examine history.
The installation debuted at the opening of the revamped Glass Rotunda in the National Museum of Singapore (NMS) in December 2016 â€“ the culmination of a project that took two years to create. The first conversation with Kudo Takashi from teamLab about the revamp began back in February 2014, shortly before the closing of Singapore Biennale 2013. Having successfully presented the immersive digital installation, Peace Can Be Realised Even Without Order, which awed visitors at Singapore Biennale 2013, NMS was excited to see how teamLab, a collective of more than 300 creatives, would respond to its latest challenge.
Story of the Forest (Lower Glass Rotunda)
The 2015 NMS Gallery Revamp
The Glass Rotunda was first erected during the museum's revamp in 2006 as a modern architectural response to its 19th-century neo-Palladian Rotunda, which was built when the institution first opened in 1887. In addition to serving as the main entrance to the Singapore History Gallery (SHG), the Glass Rotunda was also used to host a video projection artwork by Singapore artist, Tan Pin Pin. NMS then underwent an extensive revamp of its permanent galleries in tandem with the nation's Jubilee celebrations in 2015. The SHG was relaunched in August 2015, and the Glass Rotunda and Gallery 10 were unveiled in December 2016.
NMS had two main objectives when they decided to collaborate with teamLab for the revamp of the Glass Rotunda. They wanted to exemplify the museum's continuing interest in working with contemporary art and artists, and at the same time initiate relevant conversations about both the past and present.
Brainstorming Artists
teamLab's preliminary idea was inspired by NMS's surrounding natural landscape. Taking into consideration the site of the Glass Rotunda, which was framed by the lush greenery of Fort Canning in its background, teamLab sought to depict local flora in the design of the installation. This gave NMS the idea to share the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings with the Japanese collective. For NMS, it was an opportunity to not only rekindle and regenerate interest in the prestigious collection, but also to reintroduce it to the public.

The 477 illustrations commissioned by Farquhar during his tenure as the British Resident and the Commandant of Melaka from 1803 to 1818 is one of NMS' most valued collections. The drawings depict the flora and fauna of the region, and were instrumental in the discovery of several important zoological and botanical species. The Chinese artists that Farquhar commissioned utilised Chinese brush painting techniques while attempting to show the perspective and naturalism of Western paintings. This resulted in an enchanting fusion of two different art making approaches.
Transforming Dimensions
From the selection of 477 illustrations, teamLab, in close consultation with curators from NMS, shortlisted 69 drawings to be digitally transformed into three-dimensional form. The collective began extensive research on the selected drawings. teamLab wanted their artists, programmers, sound engineers, CG animators and technologists to understand the characteristics of the selected flora and fauna, before transposing the illustrations into a virtual biosphere.

Apart from the intensive study of the different subject matters from the drawings, teamLab also had to create a virtual landscape to house the three-dimensional inhabitants. In this task, the collective deployed their creativity and imagination to envision what the original artists would have experienced in their task to document these flora and fauna. Although the mediums of execution used by teamLab and the original Chinese painters are vastly different, attention to detail in both cases are extraordinary.
Building Up
Before teamLab could commence installation, they had one major obstacle to overcome. The inner structure of the Glass Rotunda was not conducive to housing the technical equipment that teamLab required for the new installation. teamLabs' architects, mathematicians and designers therefore had to work with external fabricators and audio visual specialists to specially plan the internal structure of the Glass Rotunda. The proposed structure had to house 17 projectors within the internal assembly and 42 projectors along the spiral passage.
This was the biggest installation that teamLab had ventured into thus far.
Due to the complexity of the construction, teamLab decided to first create a life-size mock up in Kawasaki, Japan to ascertain the necessary equipment required for actual installation on site.

Along with the fabricators and audio visual specialists, teamLab spent a total of three weeks testing the feasibility of the structure and assessing the equipment, before shipping the structure and technical equipment to NMS.

Bringing It Back
Once the structure and technical equipment had arrived in the museum, the team commenced installation work. The team was separated into two groups to oversee two key spaces â€“ the main structure in the Glass Rotunda and the passageway.

The teams underwent weeks of groundwork â€“ troubleshooting software and hardware to ensure that the installation would be smoothly delivered.

In addition, the team working on the 170-metre passageway was also responsible for the development of a mobile application to accompany the installation. This mobile app would add another layer of interactivity to the installation, presenting additional information about the illustrations to visitors.

The Forest
The installation was officially opened on 10 December, 2016 to overwhelming response from visitors. The museum also witnessed a surge in visitorship as a result of this immersive installation. Visitors to Story of the Forest consisted of tourists, families and young audiences, many of whom could be seen studying the installation and comparing it to the original drawings that were located in the Goh Seng Choo Gallery.
As a result of the new installation, NMS discovered that visitorship to the Goh Seng Choo Gallery had also increased. This promising discovery is reassuring as it demonstrates NMS' success in bridging curiosity and conversation about history through modern approaches and methods.

For the average Singaporean, the Japanese Occupation (1942 to 1945) is associated with tales of local heroism and courage. Speak to any member of our pioneer generation and chances are you will encounter personal stories that speak of fortitude in the face of brutality.
Yet, we do not often hear about the post-war fates of the Japanese occupiers, whose rule came to an abrupt end on 15 August, 1945. With the return of the British, what happened to the men and commanders of the Imperial Japanese Army who had ruled over Syonan-to (Japanese for â€œLight of the Southâ€) for three years and six months? Was justice meted out to the alleged perpetrators of war crimes such as the Dai Kensho (Japanese for â€œgreat inspectionâ€ â€“ referring to a general screening conducted in early 1942 to eliminate anti-Japanese elements in Singapore)?

Supported by the National Heritage Board's (NHB) Heritage Participation Grant and the Singapore Academy of Law, the Singapore War Crimes Trials web portal aims to plug these gaps in our often under-examined legal heritage. Conceived three years ago by National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Law's Assistant Professor, Dr Cheah Wui Ling, and NUS Law alumni and legal counsel, Ms Ng Pei Yi, this ambitious endeavour was born initially as a research project to uncover Singapore's own version of the Nuremburg and Tokyo trials. The aim: to shed light on the 131 cases that were heard by British military officials between 1945 to 1948 at the Supreme Court Building on St. Andrew's Road, whose original records have thus far been hived away in the British National Archives at Kew. The result: a comprehensive website featuring individual case- les and summaries, which was launched on 29 August, 2016 to a crowd that included members of the law fraternity, historians, and even representatives of civic organisations such as the International Red Cross.
Professor Walter Woon, Senior Counsel, graced the launch of the portal on 29 August, 2016.

The portal, however, is meant to be more than a researcher's treasure vault. Testament to this was the public audience present at the portal's launch, who contributed to a spirited discussion of the portal's role in increasing public awareness of Singapore's history. It is clear that the portal has gone beyond its initial academic roots, and has instead blossomed into a community-wide engagement effort. As the portal's co-researcher Ms Ng Pei Yi testifies, this â€œspirit of open accessâ€ is one that the project hopes to cultivate. It is in line with this spirit that one is able to find explanatory charts and historical photographs on the portal, which complement the case files provided. Ms Ng emphasises that this is a deliberate design, drawn up in conjunction with marketing communications and design firm, Quirk Agency Pte Ltd, to ensure that the portal is easily accessible to everyone. Thus far, it seems this has been a success, for the site has garnered hits from as far abroad as Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Moving forward, Dr Cheah and Ms Ng were already looking forward to phase two of the portal in 2017, which will feature the perspectives of Singapore residents who were part of the trials â€“ whether as victims or as witnesses. One case which both researchers hope to delve into concerns the notorious Double Tenth Incident of 1943, in which 57 civilians interred at Changi Gaol were tortured by the Kempeitai (Japanese military police). While detailed information surrounding this case can already be gleaned from the portal, the project's second phase will further explore figures such as Toh Swee Koon, a Chinese interpreter implicated in the incident but whose death sentence was eventually not carried out for unexpected reasons. As the portal expands to amplify a wider array of voices, it is hoped that more Singaporeans will come aboard to contribute to, and discover for themselves, this slice of Singapore's rich heritage.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010
Growing up in the early 1970s and in Queenstown, my first impressions of the built environment were very much shaped by the modernist and high-rise public housing that was built by the HDB around me. Home was a 3-room corner at that looked just like many others, and located on the 12th storey of Block 175, Stirling Road. From the common corridor, my friends and I could see the growth of our city as more and more high-rises were built along Orchard Road and the Golden Shoe area.
This was just a decade removed, though it could well have been a lifetime, from the environment that my father was familiar with when he was growing up in the 1940s, which was an elevated wooden house in one of the many lorongs off Geylang. They were also a world away from the single storey timber houses in the Upper Thomson â€˜Hailam Sua' area where my mother had friends who lived in rambutan plantations, and where we would go during the holidays to visit and eat rambutans straight off the trees.
Even closer to my physical home, the image of a local farm house was that of the Malay-style kampong houses, raised on stilts and set amongst coconut groves, that were shown in P. Ramlee movies that I watched with my Malay neighbours â€“ usually with a winsome young lady at the window, singing about her loved one while a gentle breeze rustled her selendang (a kind of shawl).
In those simpler days, visiting our neighbours or watching a film was as good as going away on a holiday.
Two Traditions of the Kampong House
So, back to reality, what were the rural houses that Singapore used to have by the thousands â€“ and which we called the â€˜kampong house'?
Generically, there were two main traditions of rural domestic houses: namely the Malay-style and the Chinese-style houses.

For the Malay-style house, there are numerous variations in the structural layout of the house and also the roof forms. These variations are tied to the different architectural cultures of the different parts of the Malay Peninsula and archipelago. A good reference book on this topic is The Malay House: Rediscovering Malaysia's Indigenous Shelter System (1991) by Lim Jee Yuan. However, they all share a few key features that make these homes very much suited to living in the tropics. These features are:
A steep roof (traditionally of attap thatch â€“ a readily available material, with good heat- insulating properties) that could rapidly throw off rain,
A verandah in the front, that forms an â€˜inside-outside' living room which is readily cooled by the slightest breeze, while the kitchen is at the rear,
A timber structural system, with timber walls that often had more windows than walls,
A raised floor â€“ to keep the inhabitants safe from wandering animals, floods, and also provide better ventilation all round.
The Chinese Farm House
What is less fully documented or analysed is the Chinese farm house in this region, which exhibits both commonalities and differences with the indigenous Malay house.
Being relatively recent immigrants into the region, Chinese farmers brought their architectural worldview into the region. As practical folks, they too would have made practical adaptations, learning from the locals, to what they would build. However, in certain aspects, they were to be very conservative.
The Chinese farm house in this region, and in Singapore, instead of being built from earth, brick and stone as in China, adopted the widespread use of timber for structure and walls. Roofing was also of attap and similar to Malay houses. The house would be under a single roof. Ventilation was provided by a gap of 2 to 3 feet between the top of the wall and the underside of the roof.
The house would be rectangular in plan, and based on my memory of houses that I went to as a child, there would be a central living hall where the family ate, and entertained, while bedrooms would be on either side of this hall. Similar though to the Malay house, would be the placement of the kitchen at the rear.

Picture is author's own.
On elevation, in contrast to the pleasing asymmetry of the Malay house, it retained the traditional approach of a symmetrical faÃ§ade â€“ with a central main door and flanked by solid plank windows on either side.
Perhaps the two greatest differences between the two traditions, would be that firstly, Chinese houses were rarely, if ever, raised above the ground. They would sit on the earth, with the upper timber walls resting on a low foundational wall, and unless one was quite wealthy, the floors were of bare compacted earth. Secondly, the verandah that is indispensable to the Malay way of life, is not seen in the Chinese farm house.

Post card from author's collection.
Private Havens from the City
In relation to the surrounding environment, it can be observed that the Chinese retained the concept of clearly and physically demarcating private land from common land. Their farm houses would have a fence, and sometimes, a gate way, following the practice back in China. For Malay villages, there was demarcation too for individual houses, but often in a less formal way. A common way was the use of spiky plants such as bougainvillea as a â€˜fence'. Which by the way, as I learnt in movie and folk tales, had an important role in keeping out unwanted visitors of the spiritual kind â€“ such as the very frightening â€˜hantu penanggalan'.
These houses, numbering in their thousands across Singapore, were therefore, the homes of those who were in a way fortunate enough to avoid the extreme urban overcrowding that characterised the old city up to the early 1980s. But at the same time, living in a â€˜rural idyll' meant being deprived of basic facilities and amenities of a modern life.
Today's Singapore is even more developed, but on Pulau Ubin we still have the opportunity to see some remaining examples of Singaporean Malay and Chinese farmhouses in a traditional rural setting. There, one can find a good representation of these traditional and functional forms of building, albeit, with some recent modifications, such as the replacement of attap roofs with corrugated zinc roofs.

Visiting the island gives me a cherished reminder of my childhood visits to Hailam Sua with its farmhouses in the rambutan plantations, as well as brings to life scenes from those early Malay films.

What is your mental image of a farm house? Is it what we have? Or perhaps, it is more likely to be that of cosy â€˜fairytale' English and European style farm cottages or Tudor-styled thatched buildings where naughty children, elves and fairies were caught up in magical adventures as described by Enid Blyton or the Grimm Brothers?
Well, I have news for you. Surprisingly, the island also holds one of these â€˜fairytale' farm houses from our old story books. What is this house? That's a tale I will have to save for another time...

In August 2012, visitors to the National Museum of Singapore were treated to a fantastic collection of bridal costumes and accessories from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London for the very first time.
Text by Chung May Kheun
Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 3 â€“ Jul to Sep 2012
In August 2012, visitors to the National Museum of Singapore were treated to a fantastic collection of bridal costumes and accessories from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London for the very first time. The exhibition told the history of the wedding dress and its enduring popularity from the early 1800s to the present day, through fascinating accounts about the lives of the wearers, their fashion choices and the economic and social conditions of the time through the eight major themes outlined in this article. Also on display were gowns by celebrated designers, including Charles Frederick Worth, Charles James, Christian Lacroix, John Galliano, Norman Hartnell, Vera Wang, Vivienne Westwood and Zandra Rhodes. Sumptuous wedding dresses worn by celebrities such as Dita Von Teese and Gwen Stefani were also be on display. In conjunction with the exhibition, the National Museum of Singapore also presented at the Canyon a small display of its own collection of Western and traditional wedding costumes worn by the various ethnic communities in Singapore.
Creating Traditions: 1800 - 1840
Today, the white wedding dress has become a universal symbol of the bride. It is worn by brides of different faiths and nationalities on their wedding day, even in countries where it is not a tradition to do so. However, in 18th century Britain, white was just one of the several colours worn by brides. While silk woven with gold and silver were preferred amongst the royal and aristocratic families, most women chose fabrics with colours and motifs on them. This was because many women would wear their wedding dresses again after the wedding day and white would hence be less practical.

Since the beginning of the 19th century, most weddings in Britain were conducted in the church or at home. Church weddings were conducted between 8am and midday and women had to cover their heads and arms. Families of high rank could purchase a licence to marry anywhere they wished, most of the time at home, where brides could put on short-sleeved dresses.
The Victorian Bride and Bridegroom: 1837 - 1901
White only became the dominant colour for wedding dresses in the 19th century when Queen Victoria (reigned 1837 to 1901) wore white when she married Prince Albert in 1840. The veil and orange-blossom wreath also became popular at that time.

In addition, fresh or artificial flowers like roses and the myrtle, chosen for their association with love, were used for headdresses and trimmings. Handkerchiefs and fans were also popular accessories. When honeymoons became more popular from the mid- 19th century onwards, brides would include a new bonnet, gloves and a bag as part of the accessories for their going away outfit. Many of these wedding items were preserved and some became family heirlooms.

While the bride's dress changed with fashion, the bridegroom adopted a standard wedding outfit consisting of a dark grey or black coat worn with light coloured trousers and a white waistcoat. It only became customary for the men to wear new clothes on their wedding day during the reign of Queen Victoria.
Artistic Styles: 1900 - 1930s
Historical costumes were an important source of influence on bridal dresses at the end of the 19th century. These styles, described by some writers as â€˜picturesque', appealed to women who wanted to express their distinctive identity from other brides. Evening wear was another source of inspiration in terms of the fabric, cut, construction and decoration, especially after the First World War (1914 - 1918). To add a touch of glamour to these dresses, luxurious fabrics such as metallic lamÃ©s and lace were used. At the same time, a group of young and creative British designers like Norman Hartnell (1901 - 1979) began to set up couture houses in London. Paris however, continued to dominate women's fashion internationally.

In the 1920s and 1930s, weddings in British high society became occasions of great significance for the public as a result of intense media coverage in the form of photographs and gossip columns. One such display at the exhibition is the bridal dress which belonged to socialite Margaret Whigham. Designed by Norman Hartnell, the slender ivory satin sheath gown is characterised by embroidery, appliquÃ©d and cut work flowers embellished with beads and pearls. The dress also features a 3.6-metre train.

From Austerity to the â€˜New Look':
1939 - 1951
In 1939, war broke out in Europe and clothes rationing was introduced in Britain in 1941. To cope with the shortage of cloth, resourceful ladies began to make wedding dresses from unrationed materials such as net curtains, upholstery fabric and even parachute silk. Some married in their service uniform or wore a smart suit or afternoon dress. When the war ended in 1945 and clothes rationing in Britain lifted four year later, women were fascinated by the feminine and luxurious â€˜New Look' introduced by French couturier Christian Dior.
Innovation and Individuality:
1950s - 1970s
During the post-war years, quality ready-to-wear clothing competed with the high fashion market for consumers. Wedding dresses were available to women at department stores, the salons of bridal wear companies and bridal boutiques. By the time Europe's economy recovered in 1957, a group of young entrepreneurs, tastemakers and designers had appeared and transformed London into a city that was youthful, trendy and anti-establishment. Bridal designs catered to a group of younger consumers. While the design of the bridal dress changed according to fashion, it continued to be formal and suitable for church wedding.

Nostalgia, Romance, and the Modern Age: 970s â€“ Early 2000s
Brides of the 1970s had a preference for romantic dresses, inspired by the Victorian era to the 1940s. However, this was quickly replaced by the exaggerated fashion of the 1980s, when bridal wear was feminine with a fitted bodice, small waist, full sleeves and a sweeping skirt. One of the most iconic wedding dresses of this period was the fairytale wedding gown worn by the late Princess Diana who wedded Charles, the Prince of Wales, in 1981. It was only in the 1990s when the connection between wedding clothes and contemporary fashion was revived. One of the most significant bridal designers credited for this revival was American designer Vera Wang.

The Celebrity Wedding: 1990s - 2000s
Since the 1990s, the Internet and popular celebrity and bridal magazines have fuelled public interest in celebrity weddings. The intense media coverage of such weddings has boosted the demand for dresses with similar designs but with more affordable price tags. The wedding industry has also benefited from such celebrity wedding coverage which encourages women to spend more on their wedding celebrations. As women marry later, many already have an established career and hence could afford to spend lavish sums on their wedding.

The Wedding Dress in Singapore
In Singapore, the Eurasians and Straits-born Chinese were probably the first to adopt Western wedding customs, including the wearing of Western bridal costumes at the turn of the 20th century. This was followed by the Chinese and Indians who converted to Christianity in the 1920s and 1930s.
The wearing of the Western wedding dress in Singapore became popular only in the late 1940s after the Second World War (1942 - 1945). Prior to this, the different ethnic communities in multi-racial Singapore were dressed in their traditional and elaborate wedding garments, although some wore the Western bridal attire at the wedding dinner. Despite differences in culture, lifestyle and the clothes they wear, these communities share a similar view on the idea of marriage: it is regarded as important by all and as a means to start a new family and extend existing family ties. It also marks a new beginning for two people and the marriage is celebrated at the wedding.
There are several reasons for the increased popularity of the Western wedding dress during the post-war period. First, with the influx of Western ideas and culture, it was considered modern to wear the Western bridal dress. Second, it was considered more practical compared to the elaborate and expensive traditional bridal garment. Many complex traditional customs and rituals have also been simplified or done away with to accommodate the changing lifestyles of Singaporeans. Moreover, since the introduction of the Women's Charter in 1962, monogamous marriages registered at the Registry of Marriages have been the only legally recognised and socially accepted form of marriage in Singapore.
However, traditional wedding customs and costumes have not disappeared completely. Instead, they have been integrated into the modern lifestyle of wedding couples in Singapore. Innovative couples would incorporate elements of the Western wedding attire into their traditional garments. For example, some brides would wear the Western tiara and the veil together with their traditional outfits. For church weddings, Indian brides would put on a white or gold sari richly embroidered in silver or gold and a veil over their heads. In addition, the wearing of traditional wedding costumes is still being observed at the wedding ceremonies of the different communities today. For instance, the bridal sarong kebaya in songket, a traditional Malay fabric embroidered with gold or silver threads, continues to be a popular costume worn by the Malay bride at the bersanding or sitting-in-state ceremony which confers social recognition on the marriage.

It was hoped that through this exhibition of Western and traditional wedding costumes, visitors would appreciate the common values shared by the different ethnic groups in Singapore, and also discover how the Western wedding dress has been integrated into the wedding customs and costumes in our multi-racial society.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/to-a-hare-raising-good-year-the-rabbit-in-myth-and-culture/story,"Text and Images by Marcus Ng
BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 1 â€“ Jan to Mar 2011
Smooth trickster, Easter herald, good luck charm and lunar companion. Far from being hare-brained, the rabbit in mythology enjoys a diversity of guises that mirrors the animals' colonisation of every continent on Earth save Antarctica.
The Spring Festival, as the Lunar New Year is called in regions that enjoy a cycle of different seasons, is a time of utmost festivity as families and communities look forward to the end of winter and usher in a new annum of hope and progress. The festival also marks the onset of a fresh astrological year. Unlike the Western zodiac which determines one's star sign based on the month of birth, the Chinese zodiac revolves around a twelve-year cycle in which an animal or shuxiang (å±žç›¸) is assigned to each year. Traditionally, it is believed that the year of one's birth influences his or her personality and behaviour, which would reflect in part the traits of the corresponding animal. Thus, an individual born in the Year of the Rabbit (1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011) would tend to be gentle, gracious and intelligent though somewhat emotional, whereas those born under the Dragon are likely to be passionate, bold and quick-tempered.
The twelve animals that govern the Chinese zodiac are: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. Too ancient for its true origin to be traced, this sequence is sometimes attributed to Huang Di, the Yellow Emperor believed to have reigned more than 2,600 years before the common era (BCE) and said to be the father of the Chinese civilisation. Buddha (c. 563â€“ 483 BCE) and Lao Tse (c. 604â€“531 BCE), the founder of Taoism, have also been credited, but what is known is that the Chinese zodiac has been in existence since the Eastern Han Dynasty (25â€“220 CE).
The most popular mythical account, however, credits the Jade Emperor of Heaven, who wanted to use animals to help people remember the years. He issued a decree that the first twelve creatures to report to him on the 30th day of the 12th month would be bestowed a year in their honour. The rabbit arrived after the tiger without incident, but what is often recounted is the drama between their earlier counterparts. The legend goes that the wily rat arrived first by riding on the ox while the latter forded a river. He then leapt off the ox's back to reach the Jade Emperor's palace before the weary bovine could do so. The easygoing ox was happy to forgive the rodent. But in his eagerness, the rat had forgotten to wake up his sleepy friend the cat, who thus missed the chance to have a year named after him. Thus, there is no Year of the Cat and a bitter enmity between the two species broke out as a result.
The rabbit returns later in the year when the Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated. This festival, which falls on the 15th day of the eight lunar month, coincides with a period when the moon is at its brightest in the night sky, symbolising for many the joy of a whole family. Perhaps the best known story related to this festival is the tale of Chang Er, the wife of Hou Yi, an archer so keen-eyed he shot down nine suns that had threatened to scorch the earth with their heat. As a reward, the gods gave him an elixir of immortality. Unfortunately, Chang Er drank the brew by mistake while Hou Yi was out hunting and floated away until she reached the moon and became an immortal fairy. Keeping her company on the celestial body is a white rabbit who pounds herbs using a mortar and pestle. Meanwhile, Hou Yi remained devoted to his wife and laid out a table of offerings outside his house under the full moon to demonstrate his continual love.
The Mid-Autumn Festival is thought to have begun as people celebrated Hou Yi's devotion as well as gathered their families around them in anticipation of the harvest season. The tradition of making and eating mooncakes arose in the Tang Dynasty (618â€“907 CE) and became popular as the shape of the confections symbolised the wholeness of the full moon (on which some claim to make out the shape of a hare) and the desire for a united family. During the late Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644), the practice of worshipping Lord Rabbit or Tu'er Ye (å…”å„¿çˆ·) during the Mid-Autumn Festival emerged. From a simple animal pounding herbs, Lord Rabbit became a man-like figure with a rabbit's head and wearing imperial armour and a golden helmet. With this dignified bearing, Lord Rabbit is often depicted riding a lion, a tiger, a deer or sitting on a lotus throne.
Given its nocturnal proclivities, the rabbit has become associated with the moon in other cultures as well. In ancient Egypt, hares (which are closely related to rabbits) were linked to the waxing and waning of the moon and the people of the city of Hermopolis worshipped a hare-headed goddess of fertility called Unut. According to a legend from India, Buddha, in the form of a hare, once travelled with an ape and a fox. The trio came across the god Indra in the guise of a hungry old man, who sought the animals' hospitality. The ape and fox returned with food. Coming back empty-handed, the hare built a fire and flung himself into it to feed Indra, who rewarded this sacrifice by turning the animal into the Hare in the Moon.
In Celtic and Teutonic circles, Ostara or Eostre is the goddess of the moon, a huntress with an entourage of hares who often assumed the guise of a hare herself and is suspected to be the origin of the Easter Bunny tradition. Paying homage to the fortune and fecundity of rabbits, farmers or hunters during the Middle Ages uttered talismanic oaths to seek good luck in the fields and one such chant is thought to have evolved into an archaic nursery rhyme:
â€œRun rabbit run, rabbit run run run,
Run rabbit run, rabbit run run run,
Bang bang bang bang goes the farmer's gun,
Run rabbit run, Rabbit run run run.
Run rabbit run, rabbit run run run,
Don't give the farmer his fun fun fun,
He'll get by without his rabbit pie,
So run rabbit run, rabbit run run run.â€
With typical chutzpah, the British later adapted this rhyme during the Second World War, replacing â€˜rabbit' with â€˜Adolf ' to mock the Nazis' attempts to conquer the British Isles. One place where warrens were unwelcome, however, is the Isle of Portland off Dorset, England, where the word â€˜rabbit' is taboo to locals, who regard it as a harbinger of misfortune. This superstition is said to have arisen in the 1920s when local quarry workers spotted rabbits emerging from a hole shortly before a rock fall and the animals were blamed for causing landslides by their burrowing.
Still, bunnies enjoy favourable press in most other places. The somewhat macabre Western tradition of carrying a rabbit's foot in one's pocket has multiple origin stories. One theory goes that catching a rabbit by the foot in a trap is a sign of further hunting success and so the foot was kept as a good luck charm. Another explanation stems from a medieval practice where alleged victims of witchcraft wore a rabbit's foot around their necks at midnight under the full moon to ward off evil.
Curiously, witches were themselves often suspected to take on the form of a hare. English writer Walter de la Mare (1973â€“1956), on the other hand, paints a more benign encounter with a creature that straddles the realms of myth and magic in his poem The Hare:
In the black furrow of a field
I saw an old witch-hare this night;
And she cocked a lissome ear,
And she eyed the moon so bright,
And she nibbled of the green;
And I whispered â€œWhsst! witch-hare,â€
Away like a ghostie o'er the field
She fled, and left the moonlight there.
In Aesop's animal fables, the proud hare lost a race and won infamy for his complacency in taking a nap while the tortoise plodded on to snatch victory. Bunnies in other lores fare better, though. The Panchatantra is a collection of Sanskrit stories that convey moralistic lessons in a similar vein to the Greek storyteller. In one of the fables, a community of hares agree to sacrifice one member each day to a lion to prevent the beast from devouring them all at once. However, the chosen â€˜victim' manages to trick the lion into believing that his reflection in a well is another lion. Enraged by his â€˜rival', the lion leaps into the well to his death.
Tibetan and Burmese traditions also acknowledge the rabbit as a wily creature who pits brain against brawn. But lagomorphs (as rabbits and hares are known to zoologists) earn top billing in Native American folklore, where the cottontail rabbit is a trickster par excellence who outwits vastly more powerful foes. Both joker and bungler, the rabbit often falls victim to his own schemes, only to hop back to life none the wiser. A number of Native American tribes also perform a ritual known as the rabbit dance, in which dancers circle a drum and pretend to put food in their mouths while chewing like a rabbit as a mark of respect and request to the animal they are about to hunt. The rabbit is also a primeval force: Nanabozho the creator and benefactor, or the Great Hare who stole the sun for the people and gave the gift of fire.
West African tribes also revere the hare as a comic mastermind who gets other animals to perform his tasks. In one instance, the hare was too lazy to till his fields and so tied a rope to the hippopotamus and the elephant. The attempts by the two behemoths to get loose ultimately clear the hare's fields and he was able to sow his crop. Converging on the North American continent as slaves from West Africa forcefully brought by colonists, these geographically disparate traditions of the rabbit as folk hero are thought to have given rise to the Brer Rabbit stories of America's Deep South.
In modern life, the rabbit pops up in rather more diverse iconography, from the streetwise Bugs Bunny to the risquÃ© symbolism of the Playboy Mansion. Beatrix Potter forged an urbane landscape of tea-sipping bunnies with the Peter Rabbit books, while her compatriot Richard Adams turned a pastoral idyll into a realpolitik thriller in Watership Down, where warrens of rabbits are run along militaristic lines and wage bloody war. More innocent minds dream of Thumper, Bambi's playmate in the woods, or the Velveteen Rabbit who became alive thanks to his devotion to a sick boy. One generation grew up wondering Who Framed Roger Rabbit, while their younger siblings laughed to the pest-control antics of Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. In culture and consciousness, the rabbit continues to lead men on a merry chase through fable and fantasy, and serve as a furry source for fascination and inspiration in ritual, religion and thumping good reads.
Hares and Rabbits: What's The Difference?
Alice in Wonderland kicks off with a white rabbit who leads the heroine to a journey that ends up at a tea party presided by a Mad Hatter and a March Hare. Though usually regarded without distinction in most traditions, rabbits and hares are markedly different animals in the mammalian order Lagomorpha. The former are expert burrowers, preferring to hide from their predators, whereas hares, which have longer dark-tipped ears, never burrow, relying on their longer legs and ability to run up to 72 km/hour to flee from foes.
The European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which is native to Europe and has been introduced to Australia, where it is an agricultural pest, is the archetype of its group. But across the globe, there are more than 60 species of rabbits and hares. Most are found in temperate climates, but two endangered species, the Sumatran striped rabbit and Annamite striped rabbits, live in Sumatra's highlands and Vietnam respectively.

Be Muse Volume 6 Issue 3 â€“ Oct to Dec 2013
For more than 80 years at the time of writing, the Bukit Timah Campus has served as â€œthe cradle for tertiary education in Malaysia and Singaporeâ€, a landscape of learning amid wooded hills and elegant halls of study where students matched wits with their professors and mingled with their peers. Today in 2013, the campus forms part of the National University of Singapore, housing the Faculty of Law, Asia Research Institute, East Asian Institute, Institute of South Asian Studies, Middle East Institute and Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Its origins lie, however, in Raffles College, which was set up at 469 Bukit Timah Road in 1928 as an institution of higher education in the arts and sciences, the long-delayed result of a colonial effort to mark the centenary of the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819.
In 1949, Raffles College was merged with the King Edward VII College of Medicine (founded in 1905 on the former Sepoy Lines, now the site of the Singapore General Hospital) to become the University of Malaya. Two other major mile ones for the institution came in 1962, when it was renamed the University of Singapore, and 1980, when the University of Singapore was merged with Nanyang University to form the National University of Singapore (NUS).
After NUS shifted from Bukit Timah to Kent Ridge in 1981, the Bukit Timah Campus housed various other tertiary institutions, including the National Institute of Education and the Singapore Management University. NUS returned in 2006, when the Faculty of Law and a number of research institutes moved to the grounds of the old Raffles College.
A perspective sight of Bukit Timah Campus
Bukit Timah Campus: an architectural profile
The revival of the Bukit Timah Campus as a centre for higher learning and research also led to a rejuvenation of the buildings that had arisen over the decades. The layout and structure of the original Raffles College was based on a draft by Cyril A. Farey and Graham R. Dawbarn, two Englishmen who won an Empire-wide competition to design the new institution. The core of the college was set on a hill with gentle slopes, with the Botanic Gardens to its rear and a broad plain (where playing fields would later be created) between the buildings and Bukit Timah Road. In outlook, the architecture was a clear departure from earlier, classically inspired structures, combining as it does a modern penchant for simpler yet stately and elegant patterns, with adaptations for tropical heat.
The original complex enclosed two quadrangles, grassy courtyards surrounded by long halls with covered walkways and wide arches on the ground level. The upper storeys had windows with no pilasters (projecting columns) and supported tiled roofs, pitched high for air circulation. The Manasseh Meyer Building, which bisected the courtyards, featured a pylon-like roof tower and flattened domes or copulas at both ends. Serving as the gateway to the college from Bukit Timah Road was the Oei Tiong Ham Hall, which faced a circular driveway and bore prominent arches that supported a long upper gallery. A new wing, named Block A, was added in the 1940s, followed by a Library in the 1950s and a landmark Science Tower in 1966.
In recognition of their significance and value to the civic and educational development of Singapore, six buildings that make up the former Raffles College were gazetted as National Monuments by the National Heritage Board on 11 November 2009. This status as a site protected from redevelopment encompasses the Oei Tiong Ham Building, former Library Building (now the CJ Koh Law Library), Manasseh Meyer Building, Federal Building, Eu Tong Sen Building and Li Ka Shing Building (formerly Block A). Also included were the two quadrangles of green space located within the complex.

A studied approach to a space of learning
To ensure that the Bukit Timah Campus could continue to serve the needs of undergraduates and researchers in the 21 century, NUS embarked on a programme to restore and upgrade the former Raffles College facilities. This project, led by Forum Architects, sought to uphold the buildings' architectural legacy as the foundation of tertiary education in Singapore and Malaysia, while adapting the halls and rooms to serve as classrooms and lecture theatres equipped with modern technologies.
In their study and documentation of the campus's architectural evolution, the architects uncovered several modifications and additions to the buildings over the decades. For one, the original doors on most of the blocks had been replaced, while those on the Eu Tong Sen Building had been removed; these doors were painstakingly reinstated to their design detailing and rightful locations. At the Oei Tiong Ham Block, a surprise discovery was the original coffered ceiling above the lobby; the panels were restored with great sensitivity, as was a link between the building and Block A that had been severely altered. These measures helped to revive much of the original soul, details and aesthetics of Raffles College, which many of its alumni would recall with fondness.
Meanwhile, the quadrangles where students traditionally gathered to debate and discuss each other's work had endured insensitive alterations and additions, such as covered structures along walkways that were added with little thought for integration. These changes clashed with the original design intent of the campus. To rectify this, the architects dug into the archival plans to reinstate the original link between the Oei Tiong Ham and Manasseh Meyer Blocks. A minimalist design approach was taken to bring elements of the original architecture to the fore; mature trees in the grounds, including a magnificent angsana planted not long after the campus was built, were retained and the quadrangle lawns underwent fresh landscaping to give greater prominence to the surrounding buildings. Along the corridor of Block B (before the upper quadrangle, facing the Federal Building), new decks planted with native sea gutta trees were added to provide a tiered landscape and spaces where students can mingle and relax under natural shade.
Peak of Manasseh Meyer Block
Though naturally ventilated in its early years, the buildings had to be adapted for air-conditioning. This was done with subtle touches; louvered windows were reinstalled and fitted with glass panels to keep cool air indoors, while ductwork and diffusers were carefully hidden from view. The architects also employed new technologies and novel methods to create a sense of greater, column-free space within the graduation hall of the Oei Tiong Ham Building.
In this restoration and revitalisation of the former Raffles College, the architects have captured the spirit of a historic campus and allowed students past and present to discover anew the spaces, layers and details that oversaw learning and life within a cherished national institution. For their effort, the Bukit Timah Campus was named a Category A winner in the Architectural Heritage Awards (AHA) organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2012. This category recognises outstanding restoration projects involving National Monuments and fully conserved buildings in the historic districts.

Did You Know?
The Oei Tiong Ham Building, Manasseh Meyer Block and Eu Tong Sen Building were named after major donors to Raffles College. Oei Tiong Ham (1866-1924) was the Semarang-born â€˜Sugar King of Java' who moved to Singapore in 1920. He gave $150,000, then a princely sum, towards the construction of the central hall that now bears his name. Oei's contribution was matched by Manasseh Meyer (1846-1930), a Jewish businessman and philanthropist who was also instrumental in building Singapore's two synagogues. Eu Tong Sen (1877-1941), who gave $100,000, was a Penang-born entrepreneur who established himself in the tin business and traditional medicine (now the Eu Yan Sang company).

BeMuse Volume 5 Issue 4 Oct to Dec 2012
Built in 1933, the majestic Clifford Pier Building was a landing point for immigrants and other passengers who arrived in Singapore by sea. As red oil lamps used to hang from the pier to guide seafarers, it was widely and affectionately known in Chinese as â€˜Red Lamp Pier' (çº¢ç¯ç å¤´).
The two-storey Customs House, constructed in the late 1960s, was one of Singapore's earliest public buildings built in the simple and functional â€˜Modern' style. It was home to the Singapore Customs Police, which was responsible for watching over one of the world's busiest harbours as Singapore's trade and shipping thrived from the 1960s onwards.
The Fullerton Heritage project involved the conservation and transformation of the Clifford Pier Building and Customs House, and the building of a new six-storey hotel nestled between the two historical buildings.
Clifford Pier Building
The Clifford Pier Building had a simple but unique architecture.
The star architectural treasures of the building include the roof structure with its signature concrete arched trusses, and the stained glass fanlight at the main entrance in varying shades of blue. Many other details such as the roof support brackets and even the cast iron rain water down pipes are also unique features of this building. Many of these unique elements have been expertly preserved and brought back to life by the restoration project team.
During restoration, it was discovered that some of the building's most distinctive architectural features, such as its roof support brackets, had their original shanghai plaster finishes concealed under layers of paint â€“ probably applied over the years to prevent deterioration. Instead of simply re-applying paint, the project team decided to expose the beauty of the original shanghai plaster finishes. However, as some of the shanghai plaster finishes were in poor condition, they had to be restored with matching materials and colours.
Other key characteristics of the building have also been retained. For instance, most of its faÃ§ade and exterior parapet are made up of grey granolithic finishes, carefully selected to match with the original texture and grain-sizes. Also, even though the original asbestos roof panes had to be replaced as they were hazardous to health, the final aluminium roof tiles retained the qualities of the original and the selected terracotta brown colour aimed to reinstate the roof to its original colour.
In addition, many decorative accessories were preserved, restored and displayed as artefacts within the Clifford Pier Building. These include the cast-iron red lamps and lanterns, which were restored to their original red colour, and are now located prominently in various parts of the building.
The Clifford Pier was formerly open on all sides and naturally ventilated. The greatest challenge in transforming this voluminous structure was thus to introduce within it an air-conditioned environment appropriate for its new use: a high-end luxurious hotel with a fine-dining restaurant.
Customs House
In restoring Customs House, a critical design issue was to adapt the former office building to one that houses dining establishments, while retaining its â€˜original spirit'. There was also the added challenge of connecting the building to the rest of the waterfront development.
The building was successfully reconfigured and reinvented by the project team. The butterfly fascia boards on its faÃ§ade are original conserved features. New modern glass shop-fronts were sensitively added to its first storey such that the old and the new blend together harmoniously. Of notable mention is the retention and restoration of the building's square umbrella-like pavilions.
To preserve its rich maritime heritage, only basic repair works were performed on the watchtower. The original windows were cleaned and repainted. The original handrail leading up to the top of the tower, however, was in a state of disrepair. It was replaced with an identical custom-made handrail.
The Old and The New
Nestled between two historical buildings is The Fullerton Bay Hotel. This new six-storey hotel pays tribute to its unique context by inclining three sides of its glass faÃ§ade to capture the reflections of the two heritage buildings, and at the same time presenting a sleek and modern look.
The hotel's main entrance is located at the Clifford Pier Building. A brief journey brings hotel guests from the past to the present, starting from the historic Clifford Pier, slowly transiting to a modern link-way with a hotel lounge offering glorious views of the Marina Bay, and finally to the main hotel building where the reception greets the guests.
The revitalised historic waterfront now serves as an attractive lifestyle destination in the Marina Bay area, and the tastefully preserved Fullerton Heritage was one of the Category B winners of the 2011 Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Architectural Heritage Award.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 2 - 2017
In commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore in 2017, the National Museum of Singapore launched an international exhibition Witness to War: Remembering 1942 in September 2017. The exhibition sought to explore the fall of Singapore within a larger geopolitical context, and to complement the existing World War II narrative at the National Museum which focused primarily on the Battle of Singapore and the Japanese Occupation. It also provided a platform for a micro-history version of the war to be told through the personal stories of war survivors and veterans.

It was the first time that the National Museum had led an international, blockbuster exhibition that saw the museum collaborating with 10 overseas museums and institutions such as the Australian War Memorial, the National Museum of Australia and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Witness to War featured more than 130 artefacts, including objects from the National Collection and artefacts on loan from individuals as well as overseas museum partners.
Many of these artefacts, which hadnever been displayed in Southeast Asia before, revealeda shared history with our neighbours in the wider region. The exhibition opened with a film montage that introduced visitors to the world from the 1910s to the late 1930s, before the war began. Through footage extracted from popular films of the 20th century, visitors emerged from the time tunnel with a better understanding of the regional and international context in which World War II broke out.

Visitors then entered the first zone of the exhibition, which showcased the defence preparations that the British had put in place for Singapore as war clouds gathered over the region during the late 1930s. The zone provided a glimpse into the Chinese and Japanese communities in Singapore at that time, as well as the troops who had arrived from Australia and New Zealand to reinforce the defences of Singapore.
Having understood the context behind the outbreak of hostilities, the second zone began with a dramatic display of one of the star artefacts of this exhibition â€“ the 25-pounder field gun, which was the standard field artillery weapon used by both the British and Australian troops against the Japanese Army in Malaya and Singapore during World War II. Surrounded by sandbags specially made for the display, the gun was set against the graphical backdrop of troops in battle. The theatrical setting wasmade complete with a two-and-a-half minute light and sound installation that started off with the popular World War II song â€œ The White Cliffs of Doverâ€, before the emotive sounds of battle began.
Within this zone, visitors also found a visual narrative of the Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, as well as an explanation of the international significance of the fall of Singapore on 15 February, 1942. A four-metre wide map tableout the military campaigns in Southeast Asia, while other displays depicted the British surrender to the Japanese Army and the reverberations that were felt across the region, all the way to Australia and New Zealand. Also on display were personal items belonging to soldiers, which provided yet another perspective to the battles that were fought.

It was at this halfway point of Witness to War that the visitor's attention was turned towards war survivors and veterans whose personal stories were told within the intimate setting of four story pods. Titled Destruction, Displacement, Love & Loss, and Fortitude, each pod contained an anchor story that was brought to life by a large-screen animation â€“ three of these anchor stories were narrated by the war survivors themselves. On display were 11 stories that were rarely seen or heard, providing diverse accounts of the fall of Singapore, and the impact it had on the lives of these people in the weeks following the war. Different treatments and illustration styles offered varied experiences across the different pods.
As part of the National Museum's efforts to reach out to more students, the Student Archivist Project was also developed, allowing secondary and tertiary level students to be involved in the exhibition-making process. As part of the project, students went out to interview war survivors and came back with a total of 47 submissions, six of which were selected for the exhibition. One was included as part of the main exhibition story pod, while the other five stories were presented in two video booths in the third and final zone of the exhibition.

This last zone of the exhibition was a space dedicated to reflection and contemplation. There, visitors got to pen their thoughts after experiencing Witness to War. They werealso invited to write to the war survivors and veterans â€“ whose stories they had just experienced â€“ on the letter postcards provided. Those were then handed over to the survivors and their families to keep the inter-generational dialogue going.
Seventy-five years may have passed since the fall of Singapore at the time of the exhibition, but we have not forgotten the ordeal that the war survivors and veterans have gone through. It was hoped that through these different accounts of war â€“ found within the artefacts and stories â€“ we will not forget this watershed event in our history.

MuseSG Volume 11 Issue 1 - 2018
Enter the term ""Yishun"" into any online search engine and questions such as ""How scary is Yishun?"" and ""Is Yishun jinxed?"" are likely to appear. This reflects, perhaps the broader public fascination with Yishun in recent years from 2018, which stems in part from apocryphal accounts of unusual occurrences in the town. The Straits Times, for example, has reported a disproportionate number of cat killings in Yishun, in addition to a purportedly high rate of murders and suicides. There was even an incident in January 2017 in which two men attempted to use a stun gun on police officers â€“ an act hitherto unheard of in Singapore. Coupled with other sensational happenings both reported and rumoured, it is perhaps not surprising that Yishun's identity has of late been defined by this tendency for the unusual to occur.
Set aside such reports, however, and Yishun is not unlike other suburban towns in Singapore which trace their histories to small-scale villages in the rural periphery. Its toponym, a pinyinised variant of Nee Soon, reflects this. The latter was the place-name of an eponymous village formerly located at the intersection of Thomson Road and Sembawang Road. Until the 1980s, Nee Soon Village was home to a post office, a community centre and a market, but these were subsequently relocated when villagers were gravitating towards Yishun New Town following its construction later in the same decade.1

Given this seemingly anodyne history, how then did Yishun gain its reputation as a place for the odd and unexpected? Is this an accurate reflection of Yishun's heritage and identity? Taking such musings as an inspiration, this articles examines Yishun's broader history, which reveals that in some respects, the impression of Yishun as a place where the unusual unfolds may have roots beyond today's urban myth. Even so, we suggest that this is but one facet of Yishun's heritage. From tranquil Yishun Park to the quaint but alluring Sembawang Hot Spring, Yishun is equally defined by its pleasant environs which meld aspects of today's fast-paced life with the less hurried ambience of yesteryear. In this respect, Yishun shares much in common with mature heartland towns such as Hougang, where one can detect elements of an old-world charm sandwiched amidst more recent urban developments. Arguably, one could thus posit that Yishun's place identity is defined not by a singular element, but by its synthesis of the odd and the ordinary, the new and the old, and the modern and the rustic.
The history of Yishun's association with the odd and unusual can be traced to the late-1880s, when the area near today's Lower Seletar Reservoir Park was dominated by gambier and pepper plantations.2 This was a period of shifting economic fortunes as the value of both crops had begun to fall. In their place were rubber plantations that started sprouting up across Singapore during the late-19th century.3 Yishun, however, proved to be one area in Singapore where the iconic rubber plant was rivalled in prominence by a zesty and quirky tropical fruit â€“ the pineapple.4 More than just an exotic crop, pineapples were prized by the British as a tangible expression of the wealth and fecundity of their tropical imperial possessions.5 This in turn explains why prominent businessmen of the era soon sought cost-effective ways of planting the spiky fruit.6 While some assert that growing pineapple amongst slow-growing rubber trees was a technique pioneered by rubber magnate Tan Kah Kee, it was Tan's contemporary, Lim Nee Soon, also known as the Pineapple King, who popularised it.7 In fact, by the 1910s, some 6,000 acres of land in today's Yishun and Sembawang had been leased to Lim's London-registered Bukit Sembawang Rubber Company for the growing of both crops.8 Eclipsing smaller estates such as the York and Kan Hoe estates, Lim's extensive plantation holdings were testament to his strong association with the area. By 1930, the British even saw fit to rechristen Jia Chui Village to ""Nee Soon"", after Lim himself.9

Initially populated by plantation workers toiling in adjacent estates, Nee Soon Village had, by the 1920s, emerged as a small but notable centre of commerce in the northern part of Singapore.10 Interestingly, not unlike the urban myths surrounding Yishun today, the village also attracted significant press attention for a string of unusual occurrences. As early as 1923, The Straits Times reported the arrest of a ""Hylam"" (colloquial term for a person of Hainanese descent) named Wee Teck at Lim Nee Soon's rubber factory for the unlicensed possession of an automatic pistol, 96 rounds of ammunition and a knife.11 While such infractions of the law may no doubt have been commonplace, what was intriguing was the fact that the accused was arrested in his sleep at the unearthly hour of 4am, with a loaded revolver stashed under his pillow.12 Another odd occurrence was a 1932 fire strong enough to demolish one of the buildings owned by Lee Rubber Co. Ltd. Interestingly, the 300 piculs of rubber contained within it remained largely untouched.13

Such events aside, other uncanny incidents in Nee Soon were associated with the significant British military presence in the area. This generated its own set of tensions. For example, in the early days following the end of the Second World War, an ammunition explosion at Nee Soon Camp, a military base, was reported to have ""broke[n] windows in Nee Soon Village, after having initially been set off by a grass fire"".14 As if this was not disconcerting enough, two men were found mysteriously shot dead at the same camp later the same year.15 Yet even such reports could not compare with the bizarre sightings of apparitions which habitually thrust Nee Soon into the national limelight. Indeed, in 1949, Nee Soon Village was said to be abuzz with sightings of a woman who ""had returned from her grave and had gone back to her husband"".16 This association with the supernatural seems to have continued, for a New Nation report some three decades later mentions two wardens stationed at Seletar Reservoir who testified to having ""heard and see weird things in the [Nee Soon] vicinity.17 Quoting a local bomoh (Malay for ""spirit hunter""), the newspaper speculated that Nee Soon was indeed home to a spirit, which likely inhabited an area ""where a lot of accidents have occurred"".18
Beyond the supernatural and mysterious, another facet of Yishun's reputation as a place for the unusual involves the equally fascinating fact that the town has throughout its history play host to unique events not otherwise found in Singapore. Among the most notable was the earliest iterations of the Singapore Grand Prix, which ran from 1961 to 1973.19
Taking place along a 4.8km circuit that wound from Sembawang Hill Circus through Old Thomson Road, the route took drivers to the junction of Mandai and Nee Soon Roads, within a whisker's breadth of Nee Soon Village.20 In fact, so proximal was Nee Soon to the race route that both Nee Soon Police Station and Nee Soon Village were designated as alighting points for guests arriving by bus.21 In the words of a Straits Times reporter covering the even in 1961: ""the crowds streamed in all day through the two main gates at Sembawang Circus and Nee Soon"", such that ""police [soon] had to stop the sale of tickets at both entrances"".22
Apart from significant events such as the Grand Prix, one can also note the phenomenon of institutions in Yishun adopting rather unique practices which speak to the peculiarities of their geo-historical situations. A fine example would be Naval Base Secondary School, which in the 1950s was the only secondary school in the Sembawang-Yishun area. As it was located within the British Naval Base, staff and students had to adopt the unique convention of having all 10 fingers printed before being issued entry passes! Another site which similarly speaks to the somewhat quirky reputation of Yishun is Sembawang Hot Spring, whose waters some believe can cure rheumatism and skin diseases.23 Initially discovered by W. A. B. Goodall in 1908, the spring has over the years played host to institutions such as Fraser and Neave, the Japanese Military and even the Singapore Government, who explored plans for bottling plants, thermal baths and a spa complex!24 In 2017, the National Parks Board announced that the spring would be transformed into a park 10 times its current size by 2019, featuring a cafÃ© and a floral walk.

Yet even if one takes into account Yishun's propensity to play host to the odd and unusual, what else can be said to be constitutive of the town's identity and heritage? As estimated earlier, it would be remiss only to allude to the odd and uncanny, while omitting to mention how one can find in Yishun pockets of a rustic, laidback environment interspersed amidst the high-rise concrete jungle. Yishun Park, a 17-hectare green lung situated in the heart of Yishun New Town is an example of such a space.25 While parks are certainly an ubiquitous element of Singapore's landscape, Yishun Park is distinctive in the fact that it serves, quite literally, as a material embodiment of Yishun's very own history. Indeed, unbeknownst to many, the park is sited on the grounds of the former Chye Kay Village, and this is evinced by the numerous rubber, rambutan, durian and guava trees which continue to flourish today.26

Leaving the verdant for the azure, it is also worth pointing out that Yishun has the distinction of being home to not one but two equally idyllic reservoir parks â€“ Upper Seletar and Lower Seletar. Coupled with the little-known fact that nearby Sungei Khatib Bongsu is home to one of Singapore's few remaining patches of tidal mangrove forests, it is easy to see why some see Yishun as Singapore's rustic northern frontier, replete with sites of natural beauty.27

If nature is central to Yishun's laidback, old-world charm, so too are its many long-time family-run businesses nestled amidst the bustle of modern Yishun. Located along Sembawang Road, Chong Pang Nasi Lemak is one such outfit. Tracing its roots to a stall set up at the former Chong Pang Village Hawker Centre in 1973, this popular food outlet has since become so closely associated with the area that food bloggers have christened its rendition of the well-known rice dish the ""pride of Chong Pang"". The stall takes its name from the eponymous village, which itself was named after the son of Lim Nee Soon â€“ Lim Chong Pang.
Today, Chong Pang Nasi Lemak serves as a reminder of the old village's former shops, which included traditional bakeries, tailors and even a village acupuncturist.28 Indeed, from a long-term perspective it would not be unreasonable to suggest that the stall plays a contemporary role mirroring that of the former Sultan Theatre, which, according to Pearl Sequerah, was the historical landmark of Chong Pang Village during its heyday in the 1950s.29

Until its recent relocation to Owen Road, another enterprise which was synonymous with Yishun was Danny's Tattoo Art (known colloquially as the Gurkha Store) â€“ located in a row of shophouses along Transit Road. According to its proprietors, Madan Lal Aitabir and Ram Lal Aitabir, tattoos were previously priced from between $6 to $15, which in the 1970s, attracted the attention of military servicemen from Britain, New Zealand, Australia and the United States who inhabited the nearby Nee Soon military barracks. Some American soldiers returning from the Vietnam War were even known to have requested tattoos inscribed with names of their fallen comrades. Other servicemen serving in the Nee Soon Camp from the 1980s onwards may also have been familiar with Chua Peng Hock Trading Co., better known by its later iconic name, Hock Gift Shop. Established initially as a small-scale setup selling ""tidbits, cold drinks, plastic bags, and army field camp products"", it later began offering army personnel a variety of bespoke services including embroidery and the embossment of name tags. With the variety of paraphernalia sold, it is perhaps not surprising that a 1981 New Nation report saw fit to describe Transit Road as the ""Change Alley of Nee Soon Village"" â€“ ""two dozen little ships in a remote part of Singapore"".30 Somewhat ironically, it is change which has since caught up with Transit Road. Once a hub for National Servicemen undergoing their Basic Military Training, the row of shophouses has in recent years been replaced by a private residential development.
The change that has recently enveloped Transit Road can be seen as emblematic of wider developments that have occurred in Yishun since the 1970s. With the construction of Yishun Town proceeding apace from 1977, much of the landscape has become dominated by high-rise Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats, punctuated by the occasional neighbourhood centre.31

The commercial heart of Yishun has shifted too, from the area around the former Nee Soon Village to Yishun Central, home to the gargantuan Northpoint City. Yet, as examined, elements of a rustic, laidback Yishun still exist, lending the town an idyllic and tranquil vibe typical of towns built in the 1970s and 80s. Although this image of Yishun's identity as a pleasant and laidback town has in recent years been overshadowed by sensational reports of it purportedly peculiar character, it is perhaps the synthesis of both of these facets â€“ the odd and exciting coupled with the pleasant and ordinary â€“ the jointly constitutes Yishun's unique place identity. Far from being unusual, this polysemic character of Yishun's place identity very much echoes the words of geographer Lily Kong and Brenda Yeoh:
['The] interplay of past and present in the creation of place meanings is more complicated than it seems... Place meanings evolve with each inventive interplay of time and setting, varying with individuals and the unique conditions they find themselves... There is no singular meaning ascribed to a place nor a singular way of deriving those meanings.32
Phrased simply in the candid words of Yishun resident, Jude Leong Wei Zhong:
Besides the food available at Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, what I like most about living in Yishun is that it's close to nature â€“ even my home at Springside Park is right in the midst of flora and fauna! Yet at the same time, I'm also aware that Yishun is known to others for its odd and quirky reputation. To me, that's also part of what makes this town endearing!33

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 - Jun to Sep 2011
As the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) celebrated its 50th anniversary at the time of writing in 2011, it was also timely for Singaporeans to look back on the country's economic development, a critical block in the nation-building process over the past five decades. Behind the myriad of facts and figures that charted Singapore's growth â€“ from a per capita GDP of SGD980 in the 1960s to a per capita GDP of SGD59,813 in 2011 â€“ were challenges that brought out the foresight and pioneering spirit of Singapore's leaders.
Playing equally important roles were various actors in Singapore's society and economy. Workers and companies alike helped to steer Singapore towards economic success, and their stories took centre stage in the exhibition Transforming Landscapes, Improving Lives: 50 Years of Economic Development. Personal accounts and anecdotes in the form of artefacts and audio-visual productions were displayed throughout the exhibition, illustrating not only how lives and the physical and socio-economic landscape of Singapore have been transformed alongside her economic development, but also providing a glimpse into the future that Singapore is working towards.
A Pioneering Spirit
The year 1959 marked a milestone in Singapore's history, when she gained self-government from the British. But the economic reality then was such that there was little time for celebration. The fledging nation had to deal with massive unemployment, rapid population growth and labour unrest while having no natural resources, industrial infrastructure or a significant domestic market to speak of. The subsequent loss of the Common Market with Malaysia in 1965 and British withdrawal in 1971 also provided obstacles to economic progress. Despite these challenges, then Minister for Finance, Dr. Goh Keng Swee, guided Singapore towards economic stability during the first, trying years of nationhood. With the formation of the EDB in 1961, Singapore set off on the twin paths of industrialisation and investment promotion, as a â€˜can-do' and pioneering spirit characterised the foundational years of her growth.

Perhaps nothing epitomised the pioneering spirit better than Dr. Goh's proposal for Jurong Industrial Estate, which transformed a swamp into a self-sufficient industrial town in the 1960s. Initially dubbed â€˜Goh's Folly' as many doubted the feasibility of building an industrial town from scratch, Jurong Industrial Estate proved to be a success, attracting businesses to establish factories there, the first being National Iron & Steel Mills. Singapore's industrialisation programme was thus kick-started, and it was on Jurong Industrial Estate that labour-intensive factories manufacturing a wide range of products â€“ including mosquito coils, joss sticks, sugar, textiles, plastic flowers and hair wigs â€“ were set up, providing much-needed jobs.

One of the many companies that the EDB courted was Rollei, a world-renowned camera maker. Rollei's arrival in the early 1970s signalled the dawn of precision engineering in Singapore, a vital industry that propelled the country to the next level of economic development. Apart from creating jobs and bringing German production excellence to Singapore, Rollei also trained thousands of Singaporeans in precision engineering skills, laying the foundation for the rise of the electronics industry, which remains a mainstay of Singapore's manufacturing sector today.

Besides acting as the intermediary between potential investors and the various government bodies, the EDB also awarded pioneer status to some companies, giving them an exemption from corporate taxes. Thanks to these industrialisation efforts and measures to develop and market Singapore as an ideal base for manufacturing, Singapore reached full employment by the late 1970s, with industries thriving and foreign investments pouring in.
The Transition Years
If the 1960s were the formative years and the 1970s a period of consolidation, the 1980s was a critical transition point. When the economy suddenly contracted by 1.7 percent in 1985, it was the first time since independence that Singapore had recorded negative growth. Former EDB chairman Chan Chin Bock called the 1985 recession an â€œemotional experienceâ€ which dealt Singapore a reality check after 20 years of continuous economic progress.
While global conditions such as the US slowdown played a part, the reasons for the 1985 recession were largely domestic. A loss of competitiveness due to rising operating and wage costs â€“ especially in relation to the other countries in the region â€“ and high Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates all contributed to the country's first major downturn. That said, this crisis also showed the willingness of Singapore's leaders to take bold and innovative steps in restructuring the economy to meet new challenges. In light of a new phase in economic development where sole dependence on labour-intensive industries was no longer viable, Singapore sought a â€˜total business' concept, creating â€˜twin engines of growth' that placed a new emphasis on the services sector to complement the traditional stranglehold of the manufacturing arm. In 1986, the EDB established a Services Promotion Division to drive inbound investment promotion in 18 tradable service sectors.
A crucial factor that helped Singapore regain her cost competitiveness was the tripartite relationship between the government, employers and the trade unions. Drastic cost-cutting measures including a reduction of employers' CPF contributions and a wage restraint policy were successfully implemented without social unrest as they were endorsed by the trade unions. The concerted efforts to turn things around on all fronts paid off, as Singapore recovered from the recession in two years, and entered a new economic era confident of assuming the role of a global business city.

Becoming Future Ready
Since taking the first tentative steps towards industrialisation 50 years ago from 2011, Singapore has become an economy driven by capital, knowledge, talent and innovation. Despite fresh challenges from the rapidly changing global economy, Singapore remains well-positioned to move into the next stage of economic development. The same core attributes possessed by Singapore's economic pioneers when they guided the country to economic stability are helping to maintain Singapore's sustainability and competitiveness in the global market today.
In a world increasingly shaped by trends such as greater urbanisation, growing affluence and ageing populations, Singapore continues to promote an enterprising and conducive environment for companies to set up their headquarters, while providing good job opportunities to meet the aspirations of the population. Potential investors are often persuaded by ready access to a growing international and local pool of highly skilled talent as well as excellent infrastructure. Local companies are not left out either as the robust economic climate ensures a steady supply of opportunities for them to flourish. Indeed, Singapore has become the leading hub for a number of high technology and creative industries, including the biomedical science, aerospace, energy and chemical sectors, along with interactive and digital media. Jurong Island, for example, is home to almost a hundred global petroleum, petrochemical and specialty chemical firms.
There is little doubt that Singapore's economic development and achievements over the past five decades present an eventful chapter in the nation's history. The â€˜can-do' spirit, common vision and the strong cooperation between the EDB and other government agencies have been a galvanising force in the economy. And it is this same passion and guiding principles that will spearhead Singapore's development into the future.

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 â€“ Jul to Sep 2011
The 2011 exhibition Video, an Art, a History 1965â€“2010 presented at the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) a selection of video works from the Centre Pompidou collection, in resonance with works from the SAM collection. About 50 works were shown at SAM and SAM@8Q. It was a pilot exhibition bringing together two institutional collections: one that began in France in 1976 with works from 1965 till today, the other since 2008 in Singapore; one turned towards major international trends, the other steered towards Asian works â€“ more specifically those from the currently very prolific region of Southeast Asia.
Nowadays, most international exhibitions, biennales, museums of contemporary art, certain private collections and even contemporary art fairs exhibit and present video works in diverse forms. The exhibition recounted the development of video art from 1965 to 2010 in six main themes.

Utopia and Critique of Television
Video was born in the 1960s into two contexts: those of the fine arts â€“ performance art in particular â€“ and television production and broadcasting. The first section of the exhibition presented works which explored the processes of television production, the political and social influence of the media as well as the role of the viewer. Television here appears as the key subject of the works and the medium of production and broadcasting. Video is thus shared between television and artistic creation.
At first, some artists explored the television set as an object by placing it within the artistic and displaying it in exhibitions. The first to do so was Korean artist Nam June Paik who made use of the signal emitted by television sets. He manipulated it in a very minimalist way in the installation Moon is the Oldest TV, realised in 1965, and later in the video Global Groove, produced for the New York television channel WNET in 1973.
Other artists like Valie Export in Austria in 1971 and Bill Viola in the United States in 1983â€“84, question the role of television audiences and adopt an ethnological approach to this â€˜new population of spectators'. The screen becomes a mirror reflecting the attitude of this new â€˜ethnic group'. Some other artists examine television programmes from a more critical angle, studying their strengths, powers of attraction and flaws. In the works of Sonia Andrade and Mako Idemitsu, video deflects television broadcasts to serve critical purposes, analysing semiologically their content in the 1970s and 1980s.

Issues of Identity
In the 1970s, video art entered a period of social and political revival marked by student movements, the rise of feminism and demonstrations against war and racism. Following Joseph Beuys' idea that â€œevery man is an artistâ€, the human body becomes a piece of artistic and aesthetic material. In this context, video registers, deconstructs and recreates performances by artists, whether in public or alone in their studio. In the latter case, the camera becomes the only witness to artistic expression. The human body â€“ the artists' and actionists' primary instrument â€“ most often expresses feelings of pain, violence (Vito Acconci) and desire, but also objectified physical experience which transforms the body into analogical codes, such as in the work of Toshio Matsumoto.
In 1988, Jean Baudrillard posed this question: â€œAm I a man or a machine?â€ Valie Export belongs to the first generation of women artists who challenged a patriarchal media society, using the female body to combat fossilised stereotypes. As for Sonia Khurana, by showing her denuded body, she attacks clichÃ©s about conventional ideals of beauty. The integration of the public into performances or as a participant in video installations leads to an interactive reflection on the role of the individual in our society, as in the works of Lee Wen and Joan Logue. In 1996, Tony Oursler conceived the installation SWITCH, a circuit of mise en abyme within the museum itself, which incorporates the visitor in an imaginary narrative throughout his or her visit using â€˜talking heads' and surveillance cameras, while at the same time questioning our contemporary world populated with cameras and surveillance systems.

From Video Tape to Interactive Installation
The 1960s and 1970s were conducive to research in phenomenology, parapsychology, conceptualisation and technology. In art, the emergence of video coincided with the acceptance of performance art and the arrival of installations.
This section examines representations of the self and the other, especially through the placement of the body in space. Artists such as Bruce Nauman began to document their performances on videotape before delegating the role of the performer to the viewer who is also bound by the conditions of museum space. In the age of minimalism and conceptual art, artists like Martial Raysse, Peter Campus, Dan Graham and Bruce Nauman transformed the visitor into an active and indispensable parameter of the artwork which cannot otherwise function. This is seen in Raysse's picture, Graham's mirror and Nauman's white cube (in connection with the works of author and playwright Samuel Beckett).
Most of the works in this section employed the closed circuit (a video camera linked to a monitor) or the surveillance circuit. The screen is likened to a window or a mirror, and the camera to the eye. The visitor is often filmed unbeknown and his or her image is reversed, delayed or displaced several metres away in a meticulously designed space.

Landscape Dreams
The Chinese concept of landscape (shanshui) has two basic elements, mountain (shan) and water (shui), and has inspired countless poets and painters. Using ink and brush, China's greatest artists strived to transcribe their contemplations on paper or silk. In this artistic practice, which is one of the noblest, the quest for the Way (Dao) and breath resonance (qiyun) unites the artist and nature through meditation (Toshio Matsumoto).
The mountain is also the land of myths and legends, feared at times, venerated at others and sometimes even deified. In Asia, Mount Wutai in China and Mount Fuji in Japan attest to this (Ko Nakajima). After sojourning in Japan, artists living in the United States (Bill Viola) and in France (Thierry Kuntzel) have expressed an interest in landscape as a metaphor for time and space. Both of these artists, who filmed in Japan, present man with the infinity of the landscape in their exhibited works.
The urban landscape has become a recurrent theme in contemporary video art. With the largest number of megalopolises in the world today, Asia's transformation over the last few years has been rapid and dramatic. Urban dynamics (Louidgi Beltrame), population influxes (Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba), architectural renewal (Rachel Reupke) as well as the effects of globalisation (The Propeller Group) and the loss of natural spaces or local patrimony (Keith Deverell, Sue McCauley, Meas Sokhorn, Srey Bandol) preoccupy the artists in their video works. The natural landscape â€“ the field of meditation and contemplation â€“ confronts the urban landscape, the theatre of a passive and apprehensive observation.

Memory: Between Myth and Reality
In the post-Marxist era, especially in countries with emerging contemporary cultures, artists prefer to use digital media like photography and video to express themselves. The evolution of a new geopolitical map of creation has picked up pace over the past few years, affecting most parts of the world, including the Balkans, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. It should be remembered that from the 1960s to 1980s, video artists came largely from North and South America, Japan, and Europe.
The artists in this section focused on questions linked to the reality of their world, of our world â€“ political reality (Liu Wei), ethnological reality (Sima Salehi Rahni), cultural reality (Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook), religious reality (Than Sok), and sociological reality (Arahmaiani) â€“ and transformed them into artistic works that are generally poetic. Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y is the symptomatic title of Johan Grimonprez's work that revisits historical events in a poetic, and certainly subjective, way.
By adopting the documentary style, artists stay close to historical reality. They sometimes replay, interpret, and comment upon isolated fragments of reality (Richard Streitmatter-Tran) through technical interventions like cuts, shots, sound, language, and special effects (Dinh Q. LÃª). The format of documentary rests upon the tradition founded on experimental cinema and the works of filmmakers like Chris Marker. Today, a new generation of artists offer a distinct perspective on their community that has become global, most notably through new media such as the Internet. Video thus acts like a memory exercise of societies, transposing events often situated on the boundary between myth/fiction on one hand and reality/history on the other.

Deconstruction and Reconstruction of Narratives
The sixth section of the exhibition explored the crisis of narratives and the end of representations with works from the 1980s to 2009: six artists deconstruct images and sounds from their cinematographic culture (Jean-Luc Godard, Pierre Huyghe, Yang Fudong, Isaac Julien, Tun Win Aung and Wah Nu). Video art has much evolved since Guy Debord's The Society of the Spectacle towards spectacular installations involving video projections, large screens and multidirectional sound in specially devised dark spaces that resemble auditoriums for some (Julien) and staged exhibitions for others (Huyghe).
Video artists now look to the professionals of documentary, narrative film and television series for resources. Shooting with professional teams, and editing and sound mixing in studios are common practices in art. Sound itself has become an incontrovertible element of video installation and is handled with great care. Some artists shoot their own images and record their own sound (Julien, Yang), while others appropriate images and sounds from existing films, borrowing and mixing filmed images and recorded sounds (Huyghe). The purpose of these manipulations of images and sounds is to recreate newly structured narratives that are closer to contemporary concerns. Installation here gives way to various modalities. By including the visitor in the work's space, the visitor actively becomes one of the work's constituent and necessary parameters.
Conclusion
Today we cannot but notice the proliferation of works using digital tools such as video, photo and sound. Video has been in existence since 1960, for half a century at the time of writing in 2011. Nonetheless, during these 50 years, video has made considerable progress, not only in pushing against the frontiers of aesthetics but also in the fields of technology and art history.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 1 â€“ Jan to Mar 2016
â€œ[R]ight from the beginning, we â€“ unlike other animals â€“ have felt the urge to make things more sophisticated than they need to be. Objects carry powerful messages about their makers, and this chopping tool is the beginning of a relationship between humans and the things they create which is both a love affair and a dependency.â€
- Neil MacGregor, former Director of British Museum, in History of the World in 100 Objects
Objects embody ideas and concerns common to mankind. From creating hand tools to dishes to metal alloys/ware, mankind created objects to meet evolving needs over time. As such, these objects tie in strongly with the development of human civilisation. Objects reflect our close relationships with our physical environment and the natural and animal world, and also capture the relationship we have with the spiritual world. Throughout history, humanity's complex interconnection with each other has also been further demonstrated through objects.
From December 5, 2015 to May 29, 2016, Treasures of the World from the British Museum at the National Museum of Singapore brought together many objects that illustrate the fascinating relationship we have with the objects we create and possess.
Stone Hand Axe, about 800,000 years old. Lower Palaeolithic. Quartzite. Tanzania.
Ru Dish with Emperor's Inscription, AD 1086 to 1125. Stoneware with Celadon Glaze. China.
Hand Tools
A 800,000-year-old stone handaxe, discovered in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by the archaeologist Louis Leakey, is much like the chopping tool mentioned by Neil Macgregor, former Director of British Museum. It represents the beginning of mankind's story, and our relationship with the objects we create. The making of the tools like the handaxe tells of man's resourcefulness and ability to harness the raw materials from his physical environment.
Man may know to utilise raw materials for survival and protection, but great skill and dexterity are required to transform a lump of stone into a tool, and to craft it exquisitely too. Based on many of the handaxes found in the Olduvai Gorge, it is speculated that early humans went beyond function and created them as art pieces and status symbols. The handaxes were simply too large and beautifully crafted to function as practical tools for everyday use.
Blue-and-white Porcelain Dish, AD 1403 to 1424. Porcelain with Underglaze Cobalt-Blue Decoration. China.
Seated Figure of the Goddess Bastet, Late period Egypt, 664 to 302 BC. Bronze.
Prized Pottery
The transformation of clay into pottery, stoneware and porcelain through ring marks another development in man's relationship with his environment. A Ru dish and blue-and-white porcelain dish in the exhibition are splendid results of man's search for the finest materials, his exploitation of them, and the success of his many experiments in creating ne and delicate objects reserved only for the imperial family.
Admired for their thin bodies, duck-egg blue glaze and delicate crack lines, Ru wares were only produced briefly for a period of about 30 years, from AD 1086 to 1127. Today, there are only 70 extant pieces, mainly in museum collections.
Appreciated and sought all over the world later in history were Chinese porcelains with under-glazed blue decoration, commonly known as â€œblue and whiteâ€ porcelain. These Chinese porcelains made from a combination of porcelain stone and kaolin, which was then found only in China, were very much adored for their highly vitrified, pure and translucent bodies. Produced mainly in Jingdezhen in southern China's Jiangxi province, many of these wares were exported to the Near and Middle East and other countries in Asia from the fifteenth century onwards. Great quantities of these Chinese export porcelains eventually found their way to Europe and were all the rage there in the seventeenth to eighteenth century.
Ritual Wine Vessel, 500 BC. Bronze. China.
Processional Cross, AD 1730 to 1755. Bronze and Gold. Ethiopia.
Metalwork and Social Status
Besides ceramics, the course of metal technology development also demonstrates our abilities in transforming our natural resources to make objects that will protect, serve and bolster our social positions. Man created bronze using copper and combining it with other metals such as zinc and lead. Through inventive techniques â€“ such as mould casting, lost wax technique, repoussÃ© and chasing â€“ bronze figurines, weapons, armours, shields, vessels and ceremonial implements were formed and decorated in various cultures.
Examples of these bronze objects could be found in the Treasures of the World from British Museum exhibition. They range from the figure of the Egyptian goddess Bastet in the form of a cat (dating to the Late period of Egypt from 664 to 302 BC), an Eastern Zhou wine vessel from the Houma Foundry in China, a shield from North Wales dated to the Late Bronze Age (around 1200 to 1000 BC), to a processional cross from Gondar, Ethiopia (dated AD 1730 to 1755).
Harmensz van Rijn, Rembrandt. The Three Crosses, AD 1653. Dry Point Etching.
Statue of Ganesha, around AD 1200. Sandstone. India.
Spiritual Connections
In negotiating our harsh environment and fighting for survival with other species, man turned to the spiritual world for protection. Spirits were appeased and propitiated; protection was sought from gods, goddesses and ancestors. The teachings of great beings were studied and revered, and religious systems and beliefs were created.
In some societies, certain animals were considered sacred and venerated as deities which were both feared and loved. An obsession with afterlife arose in certain cultures, where elaborate ceremonies and belief systems were created to ensure a smooth transition to the netherworld and/or to achieve everlasting life after death. Humanity's relationship with the spiritual realm can be seen in many objects, ranging from the mummies of ancient Egypt, the sculpted or cast figures of Buddhas in Asia and Southeast Asia, to the exaltation of Christ or the Virgin Mary in prints and votive plaques.
A masterpiece of this communion with the spiritual realm can be found in the work of Rembrandt (Harmensz van Rijn, 1606 to 1668), entitled The Three Crosses and dated AD 1653. Here, the scene of Christ's crucifixion is highly dramatised through the clever use of light and shade. The frail body of Jesus is situated in the centre, and all light and focus are on him and his death. Only upon closer study can one see the confusion and suffering surrounding Jesus. Prints such as this were a means of bringing Biblical stories vividly to life and to aid in private prayers. Other striking examples from the exhibition that tell the story of man's spiritual connections include a Gandanran Buddha, a statue of Ganesha from Orissa, India and a Tang dynasty silk painting of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, found in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang.

Communication
Through objects, we can also trace man's communication and complex relationships with each other. With the invention of writing, information could be passed down as records could be kept. One of the earliest forms of writing was in the form of a cuneiform (wedge-shaped) script inscribed on clay or stone tablets from Mesopotamia.
The relationship of man with each other were outlined, defined and reinforced through writing. Social hierarchies and political legitimacies were thus strengthened too.
Knowledge was also passed down via written word. Representative of this are insights into common ailments and their remedies, found on the tablets from King Ashurbanipal's library in Nineveh, northern Iraq. A clay tablet from his collection, dated 700 to 600 BC, details stomach disorders and prescribes remedies for each. It is part of a therapeutic series entitled â€œIf a man suffers from a phlegmy cough, and it turns into intestinal diseaseâ€.
Objects and Symbolism
Through the ages, man has sought to define his place in society through the use of symbols, the enactment of rituals, or performance of ceremonies. Objects carved with powerful symbols, sometimes passed down for generations, acquired extra blessings and power. An Asmat warrior would have carried a war shield to emphasise his strength and to intimidate his enemies. Personal adornments made from rare, precious materials and attached with powerful symbols were worn by man to define his position and to set him apart from other men. Netsuke were intricately carved toggles, worn by Japanese men from town during the Edo period. They were miniature and portable art pieces which were an essential part of the costume of a Japanese townsman, defining his status and wealth.

The inscriptions on a fragment of the Singapore Stone â€” part of a boulder once located at the mouth of the Singapore River â€” suggest that Tamil connections with Singapore go as far back as 1,000 years.

Sitting on the tip of the Malay Peninsula where sea routes intersect, the island of Singapore had long impressed mariners, traders and rulers for its strategic location, good rivers and great potential.2 The British were similarly enamoured by Singapore some centuries later. Under their charge in the 19th and 20th centuries, the ancient port was revived, attracting a melting pot of immigrants who together with founder Stamford Raffles, and British residents of Singapore William Farquhar and John Crawfurd, helped build a thriving emporium and shape the city we know today.

  Spurred by Dutch pressure
In 1818, the Dutch set up a military post in Riau with the support of the Johor Sultanate. This move gave them control of a critical trading passage through the Strait of Malacca.3 It also gave them the liberty to impose heavy taxes on British ships at their ports.4
The Dutch stratagem was effective in persuading the British to relinquish control of the region, however Englishman Stamford Raffles was keen to protect British commercial interests. To this end, he embarked on a mission to hunt down a new trading base near the Malay Peninsula for the British East India Company.
In January 1819, a fleet of eight ships led5 by Raffles explored the possibility of hoisting the British flag on Indonesia's Karimun islands. The islands however, proved to be too rocky.6
On the recommendation of hydrographer Daniel Ross, who was in charge of the party's survey ships, they made their way to Singapore.7 The island passed muster. It lay along the British trade route towards the Straits of China and boasted a natural sheltered harbour by the mouth of the Singapore River. With the notable absence of the Dutch, Raffles acted quickly to establish a trading post.8
This statue of Stamford Raffles has since been moved to a spot along the Singapore River where the British were believed to have landed in 1819. (c. 1905. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
  Securing Singapore as a trading post
The island's chief, Temenggong Abdul Rahman, met with the party and was open to the idea of a British trading post. To this end, a provisional agreement was drawn up.
Singapore, however, was part of the Johor Sultanate.9 To avoid legal disputes, Raffles needed its Malay sovereign to attach his name to the treaty. The sovereign, however, was in partnership with the Dutch.
Capitalising on an underlying power struggle within the sultanate, Raffles brought in Tengku Hussien Shah, the rightful heir to the throne. Hussein had been unceremoniously usurped by his younger half brother. In exchange for recognition as sultan of Johor, British protection and an annual allowance, Hussien signed off on the agreement with the East India Company. 10
The signing ceremony was attended by islanders, as well as Malay dignitaries and British officials and soldiers dressed in their finest.11 Under the terms of this treaty, the British, sultan and temenggong were to benefit equally from the venture.
Raffles, excited by Singapore's prospects, famously described the island as â€œthe most important station in the East; and, as far as naval superiority and commercial interests are concerned, of much higher value than whole continents of territoryâ€.13
With the paperwork settled, Raffles left Singapore, leaving Major William Farquhar in charge as resident and commandant for four years.
During these years, land was cleared for mercantile houses, roads, and other amenities to facilitate business. A hillock in Battery Road was also levelled to build Raffles Place. Subsequently, this very earth was used to fill swampy land to create Boat Quay.14
By 1821, the island's population had multiplied from just 1,000 inhabitants two years before to about 5,000 â€” attesting to the success of the trading post.
Left to manage Singapore on a tiny budget, Farquhar enacted a plan to curb rising crime and raise money for public works, by selling licences for the provision of vices such as gambling, alcohol and opium. 15
In 1822, Raffles returned. He drafted a town plan to better organise the colony. It mapped out areas for key economic activities, as well as ethnic enclaves to separately house the settlement's diverse and disparate communities for the sake of law and order, and his vision of communal harmony.
William Farquhar, the first resident of Singapore, clashed with Raffles vis-a-vis the management of the colony. Although he played a major role in running the settlement during its critical early years, he was dismissed by Raffles in 1823.

Growing ambitions for Singapore
The British wanted to do more with Singapore but were held back by the terms of the 1819 treaty which they felt accorded too much power and a disproportionate amount of revenue to the temenggong and sultan.
They thus began nipping at their spheres of influence, eventually drawing up another treaty in August 1824 which they pressured the duo to sign. The British had the pair give up their powers and rights to the land for a lump sum pay out, raised allowances, and the permission to continue living in Singapore.
To further diminish their standing, the British sliced up the royal Malay area of Kampong Glam by having Victoria Street and North and South Bridge roads cut through the place.16
This lithograph depicts Kampong Glam and the Padang as viewed from Prinsep Hill in the 1840s. The British built a palace within a walled compound for Sultan Hussein Shah as part of the 1819 Singapore Treaty. The compound, which included burial grounds to the north, was reduced in the mid-1820s when North Bridge Road was constructed.17 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore).
Upon the request of Sultan Hussein Shah, the British helped fund the construction of the single-storey Masjid Sultan in Kampong Glam.18 It was rebuilt (above) and completed in 1932. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
The treaty made clear that the East India Company had full control of Singapore and its surrounding islands. A separate agreement signed between the British and the Dutch in 1824 further spelled out the territorial interests of both colonial powers. It specified, for instance, that the Dutch, which had full control of the Indonesian islands, would not launch a claim on the British colony of Singapore.19
To mark this official handover, a 21-gun salute was fired on three islands of Singapore including Pulau Ubin.20 John Crawfurd, who took over Farquhar as resident in June 1823, sailed around Singapore on his ship for 10 days in a further display of power.21
Crawfurd held the office of resident for about three years, sticking as closely as he could to Raffles' ideals for the colony, while seeing through and retaining a fair number of Farquhar's policies. Although less popular among locals than Farquhar, Crawfurd was generally regarded as an effective, prudent and conscientious administrator who successfully guided the colony's next phase of growth and development.22 He, for instance, secured investments and helped Singapore set up a legal system.23
In 1826, Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements alongside territories such as Penang and Malacca.24

Sir Stamford Raffles landed at the Singapore River. Singapore's early immigrants disembarked at Telok Ayer. The coastal area of Telok Blangah in the meantime, is associated with a longer history â€” it heralded the arrival of Palembang prince, Sang Nila Utama, who founded the island in 1299. It also played witness to other significant milestones in the Singapore story. Here's its 700-year history in brief.
Watch: Roots.sg Presents: The Mythical Origins of Singapura
  Abuzz for centuries
The Sejarah Melayu, or Malay Annals, documents the arrival of a Palembang prince called Sang Nila Utama who founded the settlement of Singapura on the island of Temasik (Temasek) around 1299. He purportedly threw his crown into the waters off Telok Blangah to keep a storm at bay.
Just a few decades later, in the 1330s, Chinese trader and traveller Wang Dayuan swung by and noted the existence of settlers1 living alongside bun-wearing, dart wielding inhabitants2 at a waterway3 between Sentosa and Labrador Point called Longyamen (Dragon's Tooth Gate).4
The Telok Blangah area was also documented as having been occupied by the Orang Laut who provided their naval prowess to Malay rulers of the region.5
Telok Blangah's shrewd chieftain
During the colonial era, Sir Stamford Raffles allocated 200 acres of land in Telok Blangah to local chieftain Temenggong Abdul Rahman and his 10,000 followers.6 The temenggong lived there in an European-style mansion known as the Istana Lama. He died in the mansion in 1825,7 having been subjected to a significant reduction in his rights, authority and sphere of influence after signing a treaty with the British the year before.8
In 1833, the Malay community appointed his son Daeng Ibrahim as his successor. Daeng Ibrahim had his heart set on restoring prestige to his family's name and rebuilding Johor and its sultanate.9
To raise funds for this endeavour, Daeng Ibrahim capitalised on the trending gutta percha trade. The natural plastic produced by trees from the Sapotaceae family was in demand at the time for it could be used as insulation for undersea telegraph cables.10 Daeng Ibrahim was said to have engaged in piracy to monopolise the trade, much to the chagrin of the British.11
The money the chieftain earned was channelled towards the development of Johor. Telok Blangah was also given a facelift â€” European-style bungalows painted in green and white replaced rundown huts.12
Daeng Ibrahim, however, needed the British on his side â€” at the very least to acknowledge him as temenggong of Johor. To this end, he agreed to help stamp out piracy. They responded positively and had him installed in 1841.13
Daeng Ibrahim is celebrated for having the foresight to clear coastal mangroves and mudflats in the area. This land was subsequently leased to shipping company Peninsular and Orient which opened coal sheds and wharves.14

In recognition of his contributions, a mosque, which occupies the grounds of the family's now defunct Istana Lama palace, was named after him. The mosque is co-located with a royal mausoleum housing his tomb as well as his father's.
Both the place of worship and the royal mausoleum at 30 Telok Blangah Road are owned by the State of Johor for the Sultan of Johor.
Mount Faber's layered past
The settlement of the aforementioned Malay chieftains lay at the foot of a rolling hill range known as Tulloh Blangah Hills.15
Over time, a number of kampungs sprung up around the ridge. Remnants of at least one such village which existed from the mid-1800s to 1980s lie along a jogging path.16
The hill underwent some changes in the mid-1840s when the British decided to establish a signal station, flagstaff and observatory, and it was also during this period that the hill was named after Charles Edward Faber of Madras Engineers. He had orchestrated the construction of a road leading to its peak. Mount Faber served as a fort from the late 1850s to 1885.17

In 1905, a reservoir was built in Mount Faber's forest as a water source for the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company â€” the predecessor of the Port of Singapore Authority. The body of water is about a third the size of an Olympic standard pool. It was rediscovered in 2014.18

In 1965, the Singapore government transformed Mount Faber into a park for locals and tourists alike. It remains popular today for its sweeping views of Singapore's southwestern coast and southern islands, as well as the Indonesian archipelago. Visitors can also access the neighbouring island of Sentosa via a cable car station located at its peak.

For a journey further back in time, visitors can stop by 10 Mount Faber Road where the shrine of Radin Mas lies. The legendary Javanese princesswas said to have lived in a village in Telok Blangah. Her shrine stands as a reminder of a time when Singapore fell under the ambit of the Javanese Majapahit empire (1293-1527).
Labrador Park's historical landmarks
Labrador Park houses multiple structures which serve as reminders of the area's 700-year history.
Take for instance, a pair of nondescript brick walls which flank an oft-used path. The 1886 remnants of Singapore's colonial military past lead up to Labrador Battery. The park's various installations, which include gun emplacements and tunnels, failed to keep the Japanese army at bay during World War II.

Within Labrador Park also stands a replica of the Longyamen granite rock formation which Wang Dayuan encountered in his 1330s travels to the region.18
In addition, the park is home to a navigational structure known as the Belayer Beacon.

As part of the Bukit Merah Planning Area, Telok Blangah encompasses both Mount Faber at 105 metres above sea level and Labrador Park by the sea where the waves crash against its rocky shore.

Nicknamed Cooking Pot Bay â€“ telok means â€œbayâ€ in Malay and blanga could refer to a clay cooking pot used by the southern Indians, Telok Blangah was a port of call for Bugis traders in the 1800s and played a part to Singapore's rise as a thriving port in the region.
However, the waterway by Keppel Bay has actually been active as far back as the 13th century. Wooden ships would ride the wind down from the Straits of Malacca and pass by Singapore on to the South China Sea.

According to local legends, this was also the time that Sang Nila Utama, the Palembang Prince would arrive on the beaches of Telok Blangah and name the island â€˜Singapura'.
Living off the same coast was the Orang Laut, literally â€˜sea people' in Malay. These sea nomads lived on long dwelling boats where Keppel Harbour is today. In the August of 1819, the first Resident of Singapore, William Farquhar, spotted the Orang Laut and saw in these waters a â€˜New Harbour'.

Captain Keppel
While the deep and calm waters make for a natural harbour, it was not the safest. Due to the passing of cargo between China, India and Europe, many pirates have anchored themselves in the Straits. Chinese junks returned to China empty-handed, with only tales of ambush to take home. These tales tend to share similar narratives where fleets of hundreds encircled them, leaving them no choice but to surrender their goods to the pirates.

Henry Keppel, the man who would have the honour of having the bay named after him, was no stranger to the pirates in these waters.
He first sailed to Singapore as a midshipman in 1832, but his life would become very much entwined with the island. He later returned to Singapore as the Captain of a British Royal Navy frigate, the Meander, as part of colonial efforts to clear the Straits of pirates. Armed with 44 cannons, the Meander and its massive sails was a clear threat to the pirates.
And it was in May 1848 aboard the Meander that he discovered the deep water anchorage that made the waters of Singapore a natural harbour. His survey of the waters around Keppel Bay also formed the foundation of the plans for a new harbour of Singapore which was completed in 1886.
The harbour would be called â€˜New Harbour' until Keppel once again returned to Singapore in 1900, as a 92-year-old Admiral. In honour of his contribution and inseparable history with the harbour, acting Governor, Sir Alexander Swettenham, renamed the New Harbour, Keppel.

Keppel Bay's Docks
In the mid-20th century, if you were to hike up the winding road of Mount Faber, or Telok Blangah Hill as it was called during this time, you would be granted with a panoramic view of the southern shores. Large ships from all over the world would dot the shoreline, stopping by Keppel Harbour for repair and refuel. Ships looking to trade would lower their cargo into smaller bumboats which would find their way into the heart of Singapore River.

You would also see some of Singapore's oldest docks in their prime. The simply named Dock no. 1, built in 1859, was the first graving dock on the island. Once vessels were safely docked in place, water was pumped and drained out, leaving the hull exposed for repair and maintenance. Eight years later, Dock no. 2 was built.
However, it was in the 1900s where the docks of Keppel Bay saw its golden age. In 1913, Singapore announced to the world the â€œlargest dock East of the Suezâ€, the King's Dock. The dock was the second largest in the world when it opened and took over four and a half years to construct, with the use of 203,000 tonnes of concrete.

Collection of Singapore Philatelic Museum, Donated by Prof Cheah Jin Seng.
By the 1950s, Singapore had become one of the busiest ports in the region and to keep up with the overwhelming influx of ships, the Queen's dock would be built. These four docks became the building blocks of Singapore's post-independent economy as it sprinted towards the 20th century. Becoming a maritime hotspot, the bay bustled as workers at shipyard removed rust and barnacles while repainting large ships from across the world.
Keppel Bay in the 21st Century
Today, shipyard activity has been shifted to Tuas and these docks are no longer around. Keppel Bay has evolved from a busy shipyard to a luxurious hideaway at the fringe of the city centre. Luxury waterfront condominiums have been raised on the very grounds where seamen once stood and the docks of a past century have blended themselves into modern Singapore.The Caribbean at Keppel Bay stands on where Dock no. 2 used to be.
Although the landscape has vastly shifted away from its previous nature at first glance, echoes of the dock's place in history can still be seen in the water channels the condominium surrounds.
However, its historical significance can also be seen in the condominiums raised in its place as well. With names such as Reflections, Corals and Caribbean, these buildings erected a tribute to Keppel Bay's seafaring past.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-legend-of-radin-mas-ayu/story,"According to legend, Radin Mas Ayu was a Javanese princess who grew up in a village in Telok Blangah. How did the beauty with royal lineage end up on our shores?
Javanese-style gold jewellery discovered at Fort Canning Hill in 1928 serves as a reminder that 14th century Singapore was under the political and cultural ambit of the Majapahit empire. (Collection of the National Museum of Singapore)
Forbidden love
Radin Mas Ayu was the daughter of warrior prince Pangeran Adipati Agung from the kingdom of Java. Pangeran had gone against the norms of his time by marrying a commoner â€” a dancer he had seen perform at the palace. 
Pangeran's brother, the king, plotted to have the dancer killed. He lured Pangeran away to handle an imminent threat to the kingdom and then sent men to set the family's home on fire. Radin Mas was rescued by a loyal servant but lost her mother to the unforgiving flames. 
Pangeran was devastated to find his home ravaged by flames. Severing ties with his brother and the palace, Pangeran turned his back on the kingdom.
Restarting life in Singapore
Leaving his life as a prince behind, Pangeran brought his daughter and faithful servant to Singapore where they started anew in a village in Telok Blangah.

Pangeran, using his warrior skills, helped the village fend off pirate attacks. His bravery caught the attention of the Sultan of Singapore who invited him to visit his palace.
At the palace, an envoy from Java recognised Pangeran and let slip his royal lineage. Upon hearing this, the Sultan of Singapore made arrangements for his daughter to marry Pangeran. The pair subsequently had a child whom they named Tengku Chik.
Family dynamics were far from perfect. Pangeran's second wife was jealous of Radin Mas' beauty and close bond with Pangeran. On one occasion, Radin Mas was accused of deliberately injuring Tengku Chik after she dropped a plate by accident. Pangeran incurred his wife's wrath when he took his daughter's side.
The Marriage Plot
Radin Mas' stepmother wanted her out of the house and the best way to do so was to have her married out. To this end, she hatched a plot with her nephew Tengku Bagus whom she knew to be in love with Radin Mas.
Setting the plan in motion, Tengku Bagus intoxicated Pangeran and held him hostage in a deep well. With the threat on her father's life, Radin Mas had little choice but to marry Tengku Bagus.
A Wedding and a Funeral
During the solemnisation, Radin Mas lied to the officiant when asked about her father and if she had his permission to marry. She told him that Pangeran had died while visiting Java. Probably kept out of the loop, Tengku Chik blurted out that he had seen Pangeran in an unused well.
Pangeran was subsequently rescued. In a last ditch effort, Tengku Bagus attacked Pangeran by lunging at him with his keris (an asymmetrical double-edged dagger). In a horrible twist of fate, Radin Mas, who had sprung forward to shield her father, lost her life. Tengku Bagus' keris had plunged into her heart, killing her instantly.

Radin Mas' stepmother, the mastermind, was struck to death by lightning as she attempted to flee from the commotion.
Remembering Radin Mas
The brave princess' legacy lives on in several ways. A primary school, community centre and housing estate bear her name. 
The story of her heroics also continues to be shared by a dedicated volunteer caretaker who keeps watch over her memorial, the Keramat Radin Mas, which lies in a quiet spot on the slopes of Mount Faber.1 Visitors to her memorial are brought back to a time when Singapore was under the political and cultural ambit of the East Java-based empire of Majapahit â€” its pristine, sandy white beaches2 offering settlers respite and a chance at a new start.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/kranji-world-war-ii-story/story,"TL;DR
The northwestern suburb of Kranji, 22 kilometres1 from the city centre, is home to nondescript rows of factories, marshes and a park with a panoramic view of the Johor Straits. Behind its sleepy veneer lies a key chapter in Singapore's World War II story.
Connecting coasts
Hoping to better connect the island of Singapore with peninsular Malaya, a decision was made to build a railway in the days of empire.2
To kick things off, Singapore needed better connectivity within its shores. Up till then, its sole train track had been a five kilometre line plying between Telok Ayer and the harbour at Tanjong Pagar.3 The Singapore-Kranji line was thus built at the turn of the 20th century. It ran from Tank Road to Woodlands by 1903, with an extension to the wharves in Pasir Panjang completed in 1906.4

Both Malaya and Singapore were eventually connected by land bridge in 1923 via the Causeway. The Singapore end of the bridge was built in nearby Woodlands, along the same shoreline as Sungei Kranji (the Kranji river).5 The entire project, which cost about 17 million Straits dollars, facilitated the flow of tin and rubber from Malaya for further distribution afield.6
The Johor-Singapore Causeway, c.1970s. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore
Unfortunately, both the Causeway and Kranji were targeted by the Japanese during World War II as troops charged down from Malaya to invade Singapore.
A weak link7
In a desperate attempt to keep the Japanese at bay, the British blew up part of the Causeway on 31 January 1942. A four-kilometre stretch of land between Sungei Kranji and the Causeway, where the 27th Australian Brigade was stationed, was now in the crosshairs.
On 9 February 1942, Japanese Imperial Guards infiltrating the area met with heavy resistance â€” their invasion further waylaid by an inferno burning through the Straits and Kranji coastline. The guards suffered heavy losses. Demoralised, they considered aborting the mission.
Unfortunately, critical errors on the part of the Allies led to the complete abandonment of the Kranji-Jurong line, allowing the Japanese to establish strategic footholds. This was all the momentum the Japanese needed to make their advance deeper into the city of Singapore. Singapore fell within a week.
War memorials
After the Kranji Beach landings, Lieutenant General Nishimura Takuma of the Japanese Imperial Guard took over the Kranji Army Barracks â€” a military base built in the 1930s which has since been levelled.8 The Japanese used it as a prisoner-of-war camp during the early days of Occupation. A small cemetery, started by prisoners, was sited on its grounds.9
Perhaps in honour of the fierce resistance put up in the area, or the fact that prisoners-of-war had already sown the seeds for a war cemetery, it was decided, following the conclusion of the war, that Kranji would serve as the final resting place for Commonwealth soldiers who died as a result of World War II.10
Built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the cemetery was designed by Colin St Clair Oakes, an architect with the Imperial War Graves Commission. Reflecting a modernist sensibility, the site offers a view of the Straits of Johor and is home to several memorials, the largest being the Singapore Memorial which has been etched with the names of 24,346 men who died in unmarked, unknown graves.
More than 4,400 white gravestones in neat rows also line the serene, well-manicured site.

The island's very own countryside in Kranji â€” one of the last vestiges of rural Singapore â€” is home to a cluster of farms where goats and frogs are reared and organic produce is grown. The idyllic countryside is set to evolve and expand as Singapore works to boost its local food production abilities.
Tucked away in northwestern Singapore, within the district of Lim Chu Kang, lies the Kranji countryside. Strawberries, butterhead lettuce, spinach, eggplants and golden oyster mushrooms are among the great variety of produce which flourish on its grounds under the watchful eyes of farmers contributing to the nation's food bowl.
A man named Neo Tiew has been credited for developing Lim Chu Kang. He had the area cleared of jungle for pineapple plantations , as well as pig and poultry farms, from as early as the 1900s. These activities added rigour in the 1950s and 1960s, as a result of growing domestic demand and the introduction of more modern farming methods. A greater variety of farms thus sprouted up.1
Later, as Singapore modernised, farmers were resettled to make way for redevelopment projects such as the construction of housing estates. By the 1980s, pig farming was phased out.
To optimise the use of the city's limited agricultural land, Singapore embarked on a programme in 1986 to apply biological science and technology to intensify farming systems. The district of Lim Chu Kang became one of a handful of agrotechnology parks in Singapore.
Today, about 100 land-based food farms remain in Singapore, the majority of which are located in Kranji.2 Changes are afoot, however, as the Singapore Food Agency looks to ramp up production in the area and grow an even more efficient agri-food cluster.3

Agri-tainment in full bloom
Gardens By The Bay's super grove trees, Marina Bay Sands' infinity pool, the Singapore Zoological Gardens. These are some of the common attractions associated with tourism in Singapore.
Set up in 2005, the non-profit Kranji Countryside Association, comprising members of Kranji's farming community, pushed for the island's sole countryside to be included in Singapore's tourism canon. The association consequently developed activities and programmes, transforming the countryside into a lifestyle destination. Tourists and locals can join experiential tours and educational workshops, or sign up for farm stays.
A â€œfarm-hopper'sâ€ guide to the Kranji countryside
Kranji might be rural but don't let its tranquil environment fool you. Behind the scenes, dozens of farmers toil quietly, contributing essential produce to markets and supermarkets islandwide. To get an idea of the extent of work required to run a farm, trail off the beaten track, past Chinese cemeteries and swampy terrain, to explore some of the island's best kept secrets.
Here are some highlights from the countryside experience:
A recommended first stop is Hay Diaries, the only goat farm in Singapore. The two-hectare site started by the Hay family in 1988, houses a herd of 800 goats in roomy barns. The animals are kept on a healthy diet of alfalfa hay, and grains such as barley, wheat and corn.5 Visitors are invited to observe the milking process which usually takes place in the morning.
Another popular stop is Jurong Frog Farm, where visitors are given the opportunity to slip on boots and hang out with frogs. Run by second-generation frog farmer Chelsea Wan, the farm rears as many as 20,000 bullfrogs at any one time and also upkeeps populations of catfish, tilapia and snakehead. On occasion, staff fry frog legs with Cajun seasoning on a patio by the main entrance.6
Up north, closer to the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, lies Max Koi Farm. Beautiful carp swim spiritedly within its compound, flashing onlookers with glimpses of their brilliantly hued inky black, egg-yolk yellow, golden orange and vermillion red patterned skin. The farm specialises in breeding top-tier kois for local and international hobbyists alike.
At 100 Neo Tiew Road stands Bollywood Farms â€” one of the pioneers of agri-tainment in Singapore. Tropical fruits such as bananas, rambutan and passion fruit grow on its lush 10-acre complex. It also runs a culinary school, bistro and museum.
For a truly immersive kampung experience, visitors can opt to stay overnight at the Gallop Kranji Farm Resort which has villas, a spa, beer garden, cafe and a swiftlet museum.
You can also look out for the quarterly farmers' market organised by the Kranji Countryside Association. Visitors can have their pick from an eclectic mix of fresh produce from the area's agricultural vendors.

Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
When the British arrived in Singapore in 1819, they found relics dating back to the 14th century. One of these was a sandstone boulder at the mouth of the Singapore River, near the present-day Fullerton Hotel. The sandstone monolith was about 3m high and 3m wide, upon which a raised rim enclosed 50 lines of inscriptions on an area 1.5m high and 2.1m wide. It was split into two nearly equal parts, which faced each other at an angle of about 40 degrees. According to the Sejarah Melayu, the boulder had been hurled from nearby Fort Canning Hill by a strongman known as Badang.
In 1843, the British blew up the boulder to build military quarters. All that remains in Singapore is the fragment on display here, which is known as the Singapore Stone. Two other fragments were sent to the Calcutta Museum in 1848, but their exact whereabouts are unknown.
Singapore Stone by NHB Heritage on Sketchfab
The stone has been dated from the 10th to 14th centuries. Scholars have different views on the date and language of the scriptâ€”the inscription is written in Kawi script and contains some Sanskrit words, but it has never been fully deciphered.

Collection of the National Archives of Singapore.
The Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed on 6 February 1819 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, representing the British East India Company (EIC) and Singapore's Malay rulers, Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong Abdul Rahman. The treaty granted the British EIC the exclusive right to establish a 'factory', or trading post on Singapore island in exchange for monetary compensation and British military protection for the Malay rulers. Singapore's modern legal development has been traced to this treaty which is regarded as the first agreement signed that marked the start of the British era.
Under the terms of the treaty, the British trading post (covering roughly the area from Kampong Glam to Chinatown) would be jointly administered by the British and the Malay rulers. The rest of Singapore and its surrounding islands and waters outside the trading post remained under the sovereign control of the Malay rulers. The treaty's 7th article concerning the administration of local justice noted that the method of doing so would ""in a great measure depend on the Laws and Usages of the various tribes who may be expected to settle in the vicinity of the English Factory"". The pragmatic concession to balance English practices with local customs set a precedent and became a hallmark of British administration in colonial Singapore.
The treaty was written in English and Jawi with text in both languages presented side by side. The document on display is an 1841 copy of the treaty in English. It is part of the Straits Settlements Records collection originally deposited by the British Colonial Government's Colonial Secretary's Office at the Raffles Museum and Library in 1938. This collection was subsequently transferred to the National Archives of Singapore when the institution was established in 1968.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
This image of the Walking Buddha or cankrama ('walking back and forth') is a classic image of the Sukhothai Kingdom (1200-1350), which is today idealised in the Thai psyche as a golden age where Buddhism, the land, and its people flourished under the rule of benevolent Buddhist kings. Buddha is depicted in mid-stride, his right foot forward, and right hand in abhaya mudra (gesture of fearlessness, a hand gesture where the right hand is held upright with the palm facing outward). The left arm curves to accentuate the sense of fluid movement. The robe is barely visible except for fine outlines, and a flowing hemline. The ushnisha, or bump on the head which symbolises his enlightenment, rises to a flamed cintamani or top-knot.
Images of the Buddha were made for temples by donors in the belief that they would acquire merit for their next life. This image has been interpreted in various ways. It is thought to refer to Buddha's return from Tavatimsa Heaven where he preached the doctrine to his mother, and is also associated with meditation and magical powers, as found in stucco reliefs at temples in Sukhothai and the twin town of Si Satchanalai. The origins of the Walking Buddha remain unclear and the dating of several images continues to be questioned. More recently it was proposed that the city of Sukhothai was not abandoned in 1438 with the rise of Ayutthaya, but instead flourished until 1786 and that many architectural images of the Walking Buddha were probably produced during the 18th century.

Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Changi Prison was built in the 1930s as a civilian prison for a few hundred prisoners. It was the last prison built by the British colonial government, and is best known for being an internment camp during World War II. During the Japanese Occupation, the prison became overcrowded. The Japanese used the prison, which was built to house only 600 prisoners, to intern a few thousand combatant and civilian prisoners of war. Governor Shenton Thomas and his wife, Lady Daisy Thomas, were among the internees held there.
The prison was also known for being the site where many trade unionists, suspected communists and political prisoners were held in the 1950s and 1960s following riots and civil unrest in the decade leading up to Singapore's independence. Most of the prison, except for the 180-metre stretch of wall, two turrets and the entrance gate, were demolished in 2004 to make way for a new Changi Prison Complex. The wall, turrets and entrance gate were gazetted as a national monument in 2016.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
Chesed-El Synagogue on Oxley Rise is one of two synagogues in Singapore, the other being Maghain Aboth Synagogue on Waterloo Street. Completed in 1905, it was designed by R. A. J. Bidwell of the architectural firm, Swan & MacLaren. Designed in the late Renaissance style, its facÌ§ade is ornate with floral plasterwork, continuous corniches and heavy ornamentation. The synagogue is fronted by a three-arched porte-cocheÌ€re (carriage porch), as can be seen in the photograph here. Classical architectural features such as arches and Corinthian columns, as well as large arched windows, are repeated throughout the building.
The first Jews arrived in Singapore not long after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. Most of them were Sephardic Jews from Baghdad and were businessmen involved in trade. The first synagogue was built at Boat Quay at Synagogue Street, though the synagogue itself doesn't stand there anymore. As the community grew, a larger Maghain Aboth synagogue was built at Waterloo Street.
Chesed-El was built by local Jewish leader Manasseh Meyer to cater to a further expanding Jewish community. It was built on his sprawling, private Belle Vue estate. Chesed-El means ""Bountiful Mercy and Goodness of God"" in Hebrew. Chesed-El and Maghain Aboth Synagogues were both gazetted as national monuments in 1998. Managed by the Jewish Welfare Board today, they are open for certain festivals and for community activities throughout the year.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
The Cholas were a powerful dynasty that ruled parts of India from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE. At their zenith, they ruled all of southern India and Sri Lanka. From the earliest centuries CE, southern India had traded with the Mediterranean world, and during the Chola dynasty, with China and Southeast Asia. It was a prosperous period, and extensive patronage resulted in the building of many temples. Among the most remarkable works of art are bronze temple sculptures made for processions.
Darshan â€” to see and be seen by the deity - is one of the fundamental principles of Hindu worship. Originally, this could only happen within the inner sanctum of a temple, where many devotees of low position were excluded. Around the 6th century, a new concept emerged: images of deities were paraded outside the temple during festivals, where they could be seen by all. This led to the production of many portable bronze sculptures.
This sculpture of a seated Shiva and his consort Parvati (also known as Uma) accompanied by their infant son Skanda is visualised in the Tamil Hindu tradition as a representation of an ideal divine 'family'. Somaskanda, means ""with Uma and Skanda"", and is the most important image of Shiva in southern India after the linga, his abstract form. This is because the faithful can obtain individual blessings from Shiva when he is in the presence of Uma. In Indian art, this image only appears in the south. This exquisite sculpture was made for festival processions, hence the loops on the base to attach poles for carrying it. The manner in which the pedestals fit into each other is unusual as the convention is a single pedestal for the trio.

Xiang Xue Zhuang Collection, in memory of Dr Tan Tsze Chor, collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
The late Dr Tan Tsze Chor was one of a small group of collectors and businessmen in Singapore who were strong supporters of the arts, and were inspired by ancient examples of the Chinese literati class of painter-calligrapher-cum-collectors. He named his collection and studio Xiang Xue Zhuang é¦™é›ªåº„. The collection was known for its works from the masters of Chinese painting (in particular Xu Beihong, Ren Bonian and painters of the Shanghai School), ancient paintings and calligraphy from the Song to the Qing dynasties, transitional period (17th century) blue and white ceramics, Yixing wares, inkstones and Qi Baishi inkseals. The collection at the Asian Civilisations Museum consists of more than 100 of these paintings and scholarly objects, generously donated by the Tan family since 2000.
This painting of a pair of horses by Xu Beihong is one of the highlights of the collection. Although Xu Beihong was celebrated for his paintings of horses, he once said that he painted so many of them only because people liked them. They were indeed well received in Singapore in 1939 as many paintings of horses were said to be executed then. Xu's horses came to represent the indomitable spirit of China in the face of the Japanese invasions during late 1930s and early 1940s. This symbolism was apt as Xu was a patriot who raised money for the anti-Japanese movement through the sale of his works. Xu's horses are awe-inspiring and show his mature handling of the brush. The musculature of the horses in every pose as well as their dignity and elegance, are accurately defined in just a few key strokes.

Collection of National Gallery Singapore.  
Juan Luna (1857-1899) was born in Badoc, the Philippines. He began his studies in art practice in Manila but moved to Europe later to further his practice. During his lifetime, the Philippines was wreaked by revolution and struggles for independence from Spain. Luna himself would fight for Philippine independence in his later years.
EspanÌƒa y Filipinas is an allegorical painting, using two female figures to represent the colonial relationship between Spain and the Philippines. Juan Luna was an accomplished academic painter, and this painting shows his mastery of 19th century visual conventions. The work was painted at the height of Luna's career, following public acclaim for his monumental canvas, Spoliarium. There are multiple versions of this painting, with this version having been made for Luna's friend, the nationalist intellectual Pedro Paterno. While Spain is clearly the dominant figure, shown as guiding the Philippines and pointing to the way forward, the two figures are nonetheless relatively similar in stature and dignity, suggesting that the composition is intended to represent a benevolent and idealised image of the colonial project. The work therefore represents the reformist aspirations of certain 19th century Filipino intellectuals towards a more equitable and less exploitative colonial relationship with Spain. A later allegory by Luna on the same subjectâ€”inspired by the Paterno version - was commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Overseas Affairs and shown at the 888 Universal Exposition in Barcelona, indicating that the artwork also played an active public role in colonial propaganda.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/kallang-a-trailblazer/story,"Text by Tan Jia Yi
MuseSG Volume 11 Issue 1 - 2018
In Singapore's transformation from quiet obscurity to fast-paced innovation, Kallang has consistently exemplified the spirit of â€œnew and upcomingâ€. The area has a history of pioneering developments in Singapore, be it the tentative steps into the global economy or technological innovations like street lighting and aviation. The history of Kallang mirrors the broader evolution of Singapore with several aspects of its multi-faceted past forming a central part of our heritage. Many of the essential symbols of Singapore originate from Kallang â€“ the Kallang River, the former National Stadium and of course, the iconic Kallang Wave cheer. Throughout the narrative of a relatively young Singapore, Kallang has played a fundamental role as a trailblazer of the nation.

The Origin of Kallang
The name â€œKallangâ€ possibly derives from the Orang Kallang, a mobile community that was indigenous to the region, and who were living in Singapore before the British first arrived. The Orang Kallang were followers of the Temenggongs, or Malay chiefs who used to rule the area before the arrival of the British.1
The Orang Kallang lived along the river, subsisting on fishing and taking up various occupational roles that included producing rokok daun (a type of Malay palm leaf cigarette), providing water transportation, and gathering and selling wood for fuel.2 The Orang Kallang's role in water transportation would inspire town planners more than a century later in their plans to increase the accessibility between Kallang and Bishan through the Kallang Waterway.

After Singapore was formally ceded to the British in 1824, most of the Orang Kallang moved to the Pulai River in Johor where they remained under the jurisdiction of their Temenggong.3 Others moved to the offshore southern islands or to the Geylang area, as well as the northern coast of Singapore.4 In 1836, Dr William Montgomerie started Kallangdale, a large-scale sugarcane plantation located at the former Woodsville Road (now expunged). As similar European mega-plantations encroached into local settlements, Chinese immigrants who worked in these plantations also moved into Kallang and formed significant communities alongside local Malay villages.5 As in other parts of Singapore, the growing ethnic pluralism of Kallang, and the close proximity of different communities to each other, formed the basis of Singapore's contemporary multicultural society.
The Glory of Forefront Development
By the 1830s, brick kilns had grown extensively in Kallang, overshadowing the sugar businesses there. This shift from sugar to bricks was a logical economic decision given the abundance of mud, easily retrieved from the nearby swamps. In 1858, brickmaking had become a colonial enterprise, and locally-produced bricks were recognised for their quality, winning awards at international events such as the 1867 Agra exhibition. Kallang's brick kilns played a significant role in the construction of early towns in Singapore, paving the way for the further development of other settlements on the southern and western regions of Singapore.
Further trailblazing Singapore's development into an urbanised nation was Kallang Gas Works, which lit up the streets of Singapore for the very first time in 1862.6 Gas lighting continued to be used extensively in Singapore until 1955, when it was gradually replaced by electricity.7 Kallang Gas Works supplied the nation with gas for more than a century until 1998 when it was replaced by Senoko Gas Works.8 CityGas, the company that managed Kallang Gas Works, also produced gas as common fuel for cooking, heating and drying applications in homes and commercial premises.

Kallang's heritage of being the industrial powerhouse of Singapore is evident in the colloquialisms of the older generation, where Kallang is still remembered as huey sia. Meaning fire stronghold in Hokkien, huey sia aptly encapsulates the memories of many of its inhabitants, including that of long-time resident Seah Ah Kheng. Seah has lived in Kallang since the time of her birth in 1943, first in an attap hut and later on in a Housing & Development Board (HDB) flat.9 Slogging daily in the canteen of the gas works selling mixed rice, Seah witnessed the growth of Kallang from the time of post-war poverty and hunger to one which produced industrial innovations such as gas lighting. The Kallang Gas Works was a symbol of modernity and hope for a better future, but it too typified the anxieties of a changing landscape â€“ locals harboured fears that the gas works would one day explode and engulf all that had been achieved thus far, literally transforming Kallang into a huey sia.
Kallang also became a key location for the regional timber industry. The waterways of the Kallang River attracted enterprises and individuals from the timber industry, including the largest enterprise in the colony â€“ Singapore Steam Saw Mills, which was located along Kallang Road. Timber bought from the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian islands was shipped via the sea and oated down the Kallang River to the mills that congregated near the Kallang River basin. These timber resources further bolstered Kallang's role as a base of export for the wider region, shipping timber directly by steamer to all parts of the Far East, including Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Peking â€“ the major timber markets of the time. Thereafter, in the 1960s and 1970s, the sawmills received even more orders with an increasing global demand for regional timber products. Eventually, they moved out of Kallang and consolidated in the Sungei Kadut Industrial Estate in 1976.

One of the high points of Singapore's development in the 20th century was the establishment of Kallang Airport in 1937. Due to its strategic location, Kallang had the honour of housing Singapore's first commercial international airport building. Before Kallang, commercial air services had been handled by the Seletar military airbase. This new airport further connected Singapore to the rest of the world. Thanks to its advantageous location, Kallang Airport had become one of the largest and most important airports of the world during its prime from 1937 to the end of the 1940s.10 Costing nine million dollars, Kallang Airport was a crown jewel for the British Empire in Asia and was termed the â€œessence of modernityâ€. Famed pilot Amelia Earhart even described the new airport as an â€œaviation miracle of the Eastâ€, reiterating its unprecedented nature, and positioning it at the forefront of Singapore's development. In 1955, Kallang Airport was replaced by the newly constructed Paya Lebar Airport which was better able to cope with increased traffic. Thereafter, the building played host to various other organisations, including the Singapore Youth Council Headquarters and the National Stadium.

Memory and Entertainment
Within Singapore's cultural and entertainment scene, Kallang paved the way with its amusement parks: New World in 1923 and Happy World (also known as Gay World) in 1936. These worlds formed the early strands of Singapore's popular culture, housing dancing halls, amusement rides and iconic cabaret girls who danced to both Malay tunes and the Western foxtrot. The amusement parks were described as bustling with excitement, or using the Singlish creole term, they were â€œhappeningâ€. Seah fondly remembers: â€œWhenever we needed entertainment â€“ to watch upcoming movies for five cents or Teochew opera â€“ we went to Gay Worldâ€.11

These amusement parks played a major role in pioneering Singapore's music scene, attracting both local and regional musicians. Budding local artists including the Velvetones and The Quests were two of the acts that were fostered out of this environment. Notably, The Quests went on to produce â€œShantyâ€, the first song by a local band to reach the top of the Singapore charts, displacing even The Beatles' â€œI Should Have Known Betterâ€.12  The song stayed at number one for over 10 weeks.13 Many of these bands were inspired by visiting bands such as Cliff Richards and The Shadows to venture into their own music. Andy Lim, a 75-year-old retired teacher who used to stay in Kallang, fondly recalls watching a concert at the National Stadium:
""The stadium was so crowded. But nobody bothered with the heat because the heat onstage was worse â€“ in a good way! It was a fantastic, really hot show. That's when every boy who saw Cliff Richard and The Shadows, in their resplendent suits and with those guitars, went: â€œI wanna be a band boy!â€

The booming growth of home-grown musicians at these parks animated Singapore's music scene, with Kallang at the centre of it all. Perhaps, it is this glorious era of Singaporean music that makes the amusement parks so nostalgic to the older generation, many of whom spent their younger days dancing the cha-cha.
The old National Stadium was the birthplace of a distinct Singaporean emblem â€“ the Kallang Wave. During the legendary 1990 Malaysia Cup match against Perlis, the Singaporean coach hollered: â€œUntuk Bangsa Dan Negara! Majulah!â€, roughly translating to â€œFor country! Onward!â€, to encourage the Singaporean football players.14 The shout evolved into a cheer aptly named the Kallang Wave as it was formed by spectators at National Stadium raising their arms in succession to simulate a wave. The match was a watershed win for Singapore, not only in football terms, but on a national level; the palpable passion of the audience, moving as one to the Kallang Wave, made history in that very moment. The Kallang Wave of 1990 set the precedence for many celebrations to come, where it would be repeated at events like the National Day Parade to unify Singaporeans in one movement.
Today, the National Stadium, Singapore Sports Hub and Kallang Wave Mall have continued this heritage of unifying Singaporeans. The Kallang Wave Mall, in particular, was timed to open on Singapore's 50th birthday â€“ a significant milestone in Singapore's history. Former president of SMRT Desmond Kuek commented: â€œThe Kallang Wave retains the association with the old National Stadium, and symbolises the distinctive spirit, energy and close community ties.â€ Similarly, the Sports Hub was built in 2014 to encourage a rejuvenation of sporting events and entertainment in Singapore in the spirit of the old National Stadium. Today, the Sports Hub continues the tradition of hosting regional sports events like the ASEAN Basketball League, as well as welcoming international entertainers such as The Script and Katy Perry. These efforts to refurbish and rebrand such sites represent a continuity of Kallang's role in pioneering Singapore's development as an entertainment hub. To this day, these sites in Kallang continue to revive and extend the tradition of exciting entertainment in Singapore.
The River Flows On
Renowned architect Jan Gehl remind us that there is a â€œcontinued need...[to create] great public spaces [to] sustain the soul and life of citiesâ€.15 The Kallang River was a stream of life for over 200 years of Singapore's history, and this persists to this day in the projects for recreation under the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC) waterway.16 The Kallang River has revitalised its role in transportation, connecting Bishan to Kallang and increasing Kallang's centrality. Although Kallang's role as a trailblazer is now part of the history books, plans for the Kallang River and the new National Stadium continue to incorporate elements of its exciting past. The heritage of Kallang as a place blazing with fiery excitement, and which pioneered so many aspects of Singapore's development, is one to be cherished, especially as the river of time flows on.

Collection of Singapore Art Museum.
Born in 1940 in Singapore, Iskandar Jalil is acknowledged as one of Singapore's most significant artists in the practice of ceramic art. Iskandar was originally trained as a mathematics and science teacher. His turning point came when the Colombo Plan scholarship enabled him to study at the Tajimi City Pottery Design and Technical Centre in Japan in 1972, which cultivated in the artist, deeply-held attitudes and techniques for dealing with the discipline.
Travel has also offered Iskandar another source of aesthetic ideas, colours and motifs. His use of Jawi script as well as floral, geometrical and calligraphic motifs that appear on the surfaces of his ceramic works reveal influences from across Southeast Asia and Japan. Material culture from the region such as batik textiles and Jawi script have also been translated by Iskandar into patterns that are both meaningful and aesthetic. In 1988, Isakandar was awarded the Cultural Medallion, Singapore's highest accolade for artistic excellence and contributions to the arts.

Gift of Shell Companies in Singapore, collection of National Gallery Singapore.
Cheong Soo Pieng, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Liu Kang are some of the artists most commonly associated within the development of a distinctive 'Nanyang style' in art. Having all moved to Singapore from China during the 1930s and '40s and sharing similar backgrounds in foundational art training in China, they were close contemporaries who were driven by a desire to develop their artistic styles and techniques to best capture their new surroundings in tropical Southeast Asia.
This desire led the four artists to plan a trip to Indonesia in 1952 in search of artistic inspiration. There, they travelled across the country for two months including an extended period in Bali. Having been inspired by the culture and the vibrant colours of Indonesia, the subsequent works they produced for an exhibition in 1953 displayed a clear intention to capture Southeast Asian subjects using both Western oil painting and Eastern ink painting traditionsâ€”a unique synthesis which would later come to be considered as a key characteristic of the Nanyang Style. Important works of all four artists are held in the collection of National Gallery Singapore today. For the purpose of this spread, the author has selected Liu Kang's Artist and Model, which depicts fellow artist Chen Wen Hsi sketching a woman during their trip to Indonesia, to represent this group of artists.
Born in Fujian Province, China, in 1911, Liu Kang attended the Xinhua Art Academy of Shanghai, where he learnt both Eastern and Western painting techniques. In 1928, he went to Paris where he was further exposed to art movements such as Fauvism and Post-Impressionism. Not only is he considered one of Singapore's key artists, he was also a leading figure in the Society of Chinese Artists and the Singapore Art Society. In 1970, he was awarded the Public Service Star for his contributions in the field of art.
Artist and Model was done in a style that would come to typify Liu's paintings following his settlement in Singapore in 1945. In this work, Liu eliminated the use of shadow and perspectival depth. Instead, he emphasised clearly defined forms with thick outlines and solid colours. With the resultant work recalling the visual aesthetic of batik painting, it is not surprising to learn that Liu was experimenting with the technique of batik painting having been inspired by his artist friend Chuah Thean Teng (based in Penang, Malaysia) during the 1950s.

Collection of the National Archives of Singapore.
This landmark document proclaims Singapore's separation from Malaysia and its beginnings as an independent and sovereign republic. It was drafted by Minister for Law Edmund Barker and signed by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. It announced the constitutional change set in motion by the separation agreement and eventually effected through legislation passed in both the Malaysian and Singapore parliaments.
The secrecy and hurried nature of the separation is reflected in the plain presentation of the Proclamation of Singapore. Rust stains show that the document had been stapled together, and the holes punched on the side show that the paper had been filed in a way similar to other working documents.
The following excerpt proclaims Singapore's independence:
""[...] by a Proclamation dated the ninth day of August in the year one thousand nine hundred and sixty-five the Prime Minister of Malaysia Tunku Abdul Rahman Outra Al-Haj Ibni Almarhum Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah did proclaim and declare that Singapore shall on the ninth day of August in the year one thousand nine hundred and sixty-five cease to be a State of Malaysia and shall become an independent and sovereign state and nation separate from and independent of Malaysia and recognised as such by the Government of Malaysia.
Now I LEE KUAN YEW Prime Minister of Singapore, DO HEREBY PROCLAIM AND DECLARE on behalf of the people and the Government of Singapore that as from today the ninth day of August in the year one thousand nine hundred and sixty-five Singapore shall forever be a sovereign democratic and independent nation, founded upon the principles of justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society.""

Gift of the artist, collection of National Gallery Singapore.
Wu Guanzhong is one of the most significant artists of 20th century China. Born in Yixing, Jiangsu Province, in 1919, Wu studied at the Hangzhou National College of Art in 1936. He was trained in oil and ink painting, and graduated from the academy in 1942. From 1947 to 1950, he travelled to Paris to study at the Ecole Nationale SupeÌrieure des Beaux-Arts on a government scholarship. In 2008, Wu donated to Singapore's National Collection 113 oil and ink paintings. This was the largest group donation Wu has made to a public institution. Singapore's collection of Wu Guanzhong now totals 129 pieces and spans through six decades of his artistic career.
Zhangjiajie (å¼ å®¶ç•Œ) is the largest artwork by Wu Guanzhong in our National Collection. It depicts a majestic view of the towering jagged sandstone columns unique to this protected forest park, set behind a flowing river. Specks of magenta, orange and yellow-green cover the coarse sharp edges of the mountains, suggesting the arrival of either spring or autumn.
Wu Guanzhong first visited this area in Autumn 1979 while he was exploring the Hunan province, in search of beauty and capturing it in outdoor paintings and sketches. He encountered several villagers who all recommended him to visit a scenic landscape that is worthy of painting and would surely wow the world. Following the given directions, Wu stumbled into this earthly paradise. In 1982, the area was recognised as China's first national forest park and named Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. A decade later, in 1992, the park was officially recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Lee Kuan Yew and his first cabinet were sworn in on 5 June 1959, marking the date Singapore's self-government was actualised. With no photographic records of the event, this painting of the swearing-in of Lee Kuan Yew as Prime Minister of Singapore in 1959 provides a suggestion of what that historic moment could have looked like. It shows a close- up of Lee and William Goodeâ€”the last Governor of Singaporeâ€”as well as an aide-de-camp on the left background.
Lai Kui Fang is a distinguished Singaporean portrait painter who studied on a French Government scholarship at the EÌcole nationale supeÌrieure des Beaux-Arts. In 1968, he was conferred the Knight of the French Order of Arts and Letters, which was upgraded in 1975 to Officer of Arts, the highest honour bestowed by the French government in the artistic fields. He paints in the European classical tradition and has been commissioned to paint portraits of multiple political leaders in Singapore.

Collection of National Gallery Singapore.
Kim Lim was born in Singapore in 1936 and spent much of her early childhood in Penang and Malacca. Her father was Lim Koon Teck, a well-known magistrate in Penang and through her mother's side (Betty Seow), she is a descendant of Tan Kim Cheng, son of Singapore pioneer Tan Tock Seng. At the age of eighteen, Kim Lim went to London to pursue her career as an artist. She spent two years at St. Martin's School of Art (1954-56) concentrating on woodcarving. Then, she transferred to the Slade School of Art where she developed a strong interest in printmaking. She exhibited widely after graduating from the Slade in 1960.
Kim Lim's early period early period is enumerated by works that were very much influenced by her formal study of art at St. Martin's and later at the Slade, alongside travels through Europe and Asia with her artist-husband William Turnbull. These works, developed mostly between 1960 and 1979, are primarily executed in the medium of wood, fiberglass and steel.
This period was also marked by a significant high point, as Kim was included in the 'Hayward Annual' at the Hayward Gallery in 1977. A year prior, in 1976, she also found a place alongside her peers in Singapore, primarily those who were part of the Modern Arts Society and practising along the lines of abstraction, at the inaugural exhibition that surveyed currents in Singapore art at the former National Museum Art Gallery. In 1974, she was also invited for a solo-show at the then influential Alpha Gallery that had developed a reputation for being at the centre of debates on minimalism in Southeast Asia. Kim passed away in 1997.

Collection of Singapore Art Museum.
Born in Singapore in 1963, Jane Lee graduated from LASALLE-SIA College of the Arts with a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts and a Diploma in Fashion. Amongst other awards, she was the recipient of the inaugural Singapore Art Exhibition Art Prize in 2007. Since 2002, she has exhibited widely in the region, including at international platforms such as Singapore Biennale in 2008.
Status examines the genre of painting by means of pushing the limits of materials and techniques by highlighting the creation process. The work, which is monumental, crosses the boundaries of painting, sculpture and installation, defying traditional categorisation. With the paint seemingly escaping from its frame and pooling at the bottom of the work, it compels the viewer to examine it from several angles, and also to re-think the practice of painting in this new era of art-making. Status was the centrepiece at Lee's 2009 solo exhibition.

The former Hollander Collection of Indian Trade Cloth, Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Large quantities of Indian textiles produced in various centres in Gujarat, the Deccan and Coromandel Coast were traded across Southeast Asia until the end of the 19th century. They represented strong maritime trade links between India and Southeast Asia, and in this instance, between the port cities of the Coromandel Coast (the coastline of today's Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh states) and Southeast Asia. Alongside these textiles and other goods came people to the port cities of Southeast Asia, including Singapore. The majority of Singapore's historic Indian community came from coastal regions in India and Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka).
Among their functions, Indian trade cloth served as attire for royalty, diplomatic gifts, displays on festive occasions, and clothing for the populace at rites of passage and other ceremonies. These trade cloths had a strong influence on the development of Southeast Asian textiles. It is believed that local makers began producing cloth, possibly borrowing patterns and motifs from earlier Indian examples, to make up for the shortage of the Indian ones that began to decline in numbers as European nations began producing their own textiles in the 19th century, taking over the global market.
This hanging or canopy is dyed using the mordant and resist dyeing technique on cotton cloth. It features a central motif of a large lotus-like pattern with ribbon, leaves and floral designs. Mordant-dyeing describes a process of using a mordant as a fixing agent to bond the dye to the cloth. Resist-dyeing uses either molten wax or moist mud as resists to prevent the dye from colouring those areas. These two techniques may be used separately or in combination during the dyeing process.

John Bastin Collection, National Library, Singapore.
Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles was a British civil servant and statesman best known for setting up a British trading settlement in Singapore in 1819. After the capture of Java by the British in 1811, Raffles was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the island, a position he held until 1815. While in Java, Raffles with the help of European and Javanese scholars and informants, whom he did not always acknowledge, commissioned surveys of the island's monumental Hindu-Buddhist monuments, including Borobudur and Prambanan. He also built up a collection of Javanese cultural material such as wayang kulit puppets and gamelan instruments.
Collecting of these materials was made possible through purchases, acts of gifting and war booty, the latter as a result of the Raffles-sanctioned attack on the Yogyakarta palace in 1812.
Over several months in England, Raffles would organise all the materials he had amassed during his time in Java into a survey and history of the island state, first published in 1817 as The History of Java. That same year, in recognition for his work on Java, Raffles was conferred a Knighthood by the Prince Regent (the future King George IV of Great Britain).

Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
These are Javanese-style gold jewellery found at Bukit Larangan, which is the old name for Fort Canning Hill. The armlet bears a repousseÌ plaque of the Javanese kala, a protective symbol which traditionally adorns the top of main entrances of temples, and is still found in many parts of Indonesia. The armlet also has flexible chains, some of which were already broken when it was discovered. The earrings, each with a socket joint and wire hinge, are set with diamonds.
These were found at Fort Canning Hill in 1928 by labourers excavating for a reservoir. The site engineer recorded that the ornaments were lying just beneath the top of the pre-colonial soil strata, indicating their existence before the British arrived in 1819. The East Javanese style of these solid gold ornaments is a reminder that in the 14th century, the island of Singapore was under the political and cultural ambit of the East Java-based empire of Majapahit.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Melaka in the 15th century, under the reign of the Melaka Sultanate, was the pre-eminent port and trading city in Southeast Asia. Its wealth and power rivalled even distant Venice, so much so that Portuguese explorer, TomeÌ Pires, noted that ""whoever is Lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice"".
This tombstone dates to the heyday of Melaka's economic and political power in the pre-colonial period, before its capture by the Portuguese in 1511. It is inscribed with Quranic verses and dedicated to a ship's captain from Gujarat (in western India), who died in 1459. Gujarati traders were so important to Melaka that one of the four harbour masters was dedicated just to managing their trade. The tombstone was found by British engineers in the walls of the Portuguese fortress in Melaka and were among the first objects accessioned into the collection of Raffles Library and Museum in Singapore.
One of the most significant legacies of Melaka was the adoption of Islam as the state religion and its eventual transmission to almost the entire Malay World. Another important legacy was the codification of laws, ritual and culture, even down to details in dress and language in the Malay world. Following the fall of Melaka to the Portuguese, its last Sultan would flee to Johor-Riau to establish a new Sultanate.

Collection of the Singapore Botanic Gardens' Herbarium.
A herbarium specimen is a pressed sample of a plant that is stored for future reference. The herbarium at the Singapore Botanic Gardens is home to about 750,000 dried paper mounted plant specimens of which about 10,000 are type specimens (the ultimate points of reference for the correct application of species' names). The gardens' preserved collections were first started by James Murton in 1875 but greatly expanded from 1888 when Henry Ridley was the director. The herbarium is Singapore's major archive for botanical research specimens. It serves as an important reference centre for research on the region's plant diversity for botanists around the world.
Commonly known as the Singapore Ginger, this species was described as new to science in November 2014. It was named Zingiber singapurense as Singapore was where it was discovered and is the only place in world where the species is known to occur in the wild. This plant can be found in Singapore's primary forests and as there are only a few populations left, it is considered critically endangered. It is receiving special attention under the National Parks Board's Species Recovery Programme.
Established in 1859, the Singapore Botanic Gardens played an important historical role in the introduction and promotion of many plants of economic value to Southeast Asia, including the ParaÌ rubber tree. Today, the 82-hectare Gardens is a key civic and community space, and an international tourist destination. Attracting an annual visitorship of more than five million, it is also an important institution for tropical botanical and horticultural research, education and conservation. The Gardens was inscribed as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015.

1960sâ€“1970s.
Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
This television set was produced by Setron (Singapore Electronics) Limited, which made Singapore's first locally-assembled black-and-white television set in late 1964. Setron Limited was previously a coffee trading company, Heng Guan Limited, which had to shut down as its Indonesian-based business was affected by Konfrontasi (Confrontation). Set up by local businessmen, Setron Limited was the first television assembly plant in Southeast Asia when it began manufacturing in late 1964. Setron became a household name in Singapore by the 1970s.
The Setron factory was located at the former Tanglin Halt Industrial Estate, one of the first industrial estates in Singapore. Measuring some 20 acres of land and comprising a total of 38 factory lots for cottage industries, the establishment of the Tanglin Halt Industrial Estate marked Singapore's drive into industrialisation and diversification from a declining entrepoÌ‚t economy. Tanglin Halt was chosen for its close proximity to the former Malayan Railways and large labour catchment.
Managed by the Jurong Town Corporation, the former Tanglin Halt Industrial Estate was developed in the 1960s to house light and medium industries. Land was leased to budding industrialists on easy repayment terms and tax incentives were given to multinational corporations. By the end of the decade, Tanglin Halt was home to a smorgasbord of factories. Aside from Setron, there were Van Houten chocolate factory, Diethelm aluminium factory and Unitex garment factory. In fact, it was at Tanglin Halt that Setron rolled out Singapore's first black and white television in 1964. In the late 1980s, factories at the former Tanglin Halt Industrial Estate began to relocate to bigger industrial estates and clusters in order to enjoy economies of scale.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Porcelain bowls of this type that depict the hongs (è¡Œ) or trading companies of Western merchants at the port city of Canton (today's Guangzhou) were produced by Chinese artisans for export to Western markets by way of Canton. This piece is a fine example that not only vividly conveys the beautiful scene at Canton, but also documents the trade between China and the West during the 18th and 19th centuries.
Canton is important in the history of global trade because for about 100 years between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s, it was the sole source of Chinese luxury goods such as tea, silks, lacquer and porcelain. The Dutch and British established their ports of Batavia and Singapore in Southeast Asia respectively to take advantage of the Canton trade. These ports functioned as entrepoÌ‚ts for the re-export of Chinese luxury goods to the West.
In 1842, the first Opium War erupted near the port of Canton. In the aftermath and the decades to come, China was forced to sign a series of Unequal Treaties that saw many of its coastal portsâ€”such as Amoy (Xiamen), Foochow (Fuzhou), Shanghai, Hong Kong, and of course, Cantonâ€”open up for international trade. It is from these ""treaty ports"" that Singapore's Chinese population of Hokkiens, Cantonese, Teochew, Hokchiew, Hakka (and others) arrived in the 1800s and 1900s.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
The Portuguese arrived in Asia from 1509 onwards, establishing trading settlements in Goa, Melaka, Macau and Nagasaki. By the mid-1600s, the Dutch would eclipse the Portuguese, taking over Melaka and Nagasaki, and establishing their Eastern headquarters at Batavia (today's Jakarta). The Dutch Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie (VOC), or ""United East India Company"" reigned supreme in Southeast Asia for 200 years until they were challenged by the British East India Company in the early 1800s from their headquarters in Singapore. From Batavia, the VOC would re-export luxury goods from China and Japan, such as this porcelain export-ware dish.
The underglaze-blue decoration of this dish centres on the VOC monogram, which is circled by the long tails of two phoenixes. Alternating panels on the rim of peonies and bamboo are a characteristic of kraakware, the earliest form of Chinese export-ware to be made for the West. Porcelain ware was commissioned from kilns in Arita, Japan, by the VOC in a period where production in China was disrupted by rebellions at the end of the Ming dynasty. These dishes were then exported via the port city of Nagasaki, where they would be taken to Batavia for onward exporting to Europe. Monogrammed dishes such as these were reserved for use by officers of the Company and were therefore not frequently ordered.

Singaporeans identify with Pasir Ris in different ways. For the many residents who live in Pasir Ris, the town is home. But to others, it is a place filled with memories of Basic Military Training where Singaporean sons shared hugs of greetings and goodbyes with their families and friends. Most Singaporeans, however, would associate Pasir Ris with a place to unwind and take a break from the mundane and hectic routines of school and work by enjoying the town's coastal chalets, water theme park and beachfront. The unique history of Pasir Ris, and its identity as a beachfront town for rest and recreation have shaped its development and defined its unique character in the collective memory of Singaporeans.
Origins: â€œSand to Be Shredâ€
The first mention of Pasir Ris dates back to 1844 in land surveyor John Turnbull Thomson's map, where its name was spelled â€œPassier Reisâ€.1 The name Pasir Ris is possibly a contraction of the word â€œPasir Hirisâ€ (in Malay, Pasir means â€œlong sandâ€ and Hiris means â€œto shred or sliceâ€).2  This likely indicates that the locale was named after its sandy beach front.
The early Pasir Ris villages, such as Kampong Loyang and Kampong Pasir Ris, were all centred on agriculture and livestock farming, and these were the mainstay activities in the district in the early-19th century.3 This, however, changed in the 1890s when Jewish broker Ezra Nathan and real estate agent H. D. Chopard built country homes meant for rest and recreation in Pasir Ris. Chopard's bungalow, priced at $2 per day, had sea bathing and fresh water as its key selling points. Its popularity, however, is unknown.3 Similarly, Nathan's bungalow in Pasir Ris was also utilised for celebrations and recreation, though specifically by the Jewish community.5 The establishment of these holiday bungalows by the beach in the 19th century marked the beginning of Pasir Ris' recreational nature.
Early Development of the Beach Front
After the establishment of these bungalows, Pasir Ris soon gained a reputation as a retreat space for the upper echelons of Singapore's society. For instance, wealthy businessman Teo Kim Eng often hosted gatherings for the Useful Badminton Party, a reputable badminton club, at his Pasir Ris bungalow.6 Newspaper advertisements also illustrate Teo's bungalow being used for picnics for the Straits Chinese Methodist Youth Fellowship.7
However, getting to Pasir Ris was a difficult challenge. To approach Pasir Ris from the city centre, one had to travel the length of Changi Road before turning west down Tampines Road for many miles. For Teo's events, transportation for participants even had to be arranged and announced on the newspapers.8 Compared to the easily accessible south-eastern coastline stretching from Tanjong Katong to Changi (present-day East Coast area), Pasir Ris was a much less desirable location.9 The inaccessibility of Pasir Ris perhaps explains why there are scant records of new seaside bungalows being built there between the 1910s and 1930s.
The 1950s: Further Expansion
After a pause during the Japanese Occupation, a number of new developments commenced on the Pasir Ris beachfront. The popularity of the beach and the demand for recreation in the post-war years gave private investors an incentive to develop a resort hotel there. One such development was the former Pasir Ris Hotel, which opened on 17 May 1952 at 143 Elias Road, off the 10th milestone of Tampines Road.10 However, like the earlier retreat houses, the recreational facilities at Pasir Ris Hotel were open only to a select group of people. In May 1959, the hotel was taken over by the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and used exclusively for their personnel and families. This resulted in quite a stir during an incident where Hong Kong star Ting Lan was denied service from the hotel staff after her filming.11 Such incidents aptly reflect how Pasir Ris was a popular recreation destination only for colonial administrators and the affluent, at least until the mid-1950s.
Nevertheless, efforts to develop Pasir Ris as a town for recreation and leisure were not just relegated to the private sector, and state-initiated efforts eventually opened up the beach for greater public use. In 1958, the state-run Singapore Rural Board developed the beaches at Changi and Pasir Ris. Then Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock officially opened facilities at Pasir Ris beach in August 1958, claiming they were â€œavailable to everyone on the islandâ€.12 The development saw the building of a promenade, the installation of shelters and seats, as well as the construction of a sea wall.13 Shortly after the opening, the Singapore City Council planned a giant picnic at Pasir Ris beach for 5,000 of its employees and their family members. Ninety buses and four hundred cars were activated to transport the employees, while 50 hawkers were given special permission to set up food stalls.14 These forms of government endorsement helped Pasir Ris to gradually shift its public image from an elitist recreation destination to a more inclusive one.
This combination of government and private initiatives reinforced Pasir Ris' identity as a resort- like recreational town. In the 1950s and early 60s, Pasir Ris beach became a go-to place for the hit recreational activity of the time â€“ water skiing. The sport attracted people from all walks of life, including British Commissioner General of Southeast Asia Malcolm MacDonald who participated in a water ski gala there in 1955.15 Additionally, the Malayan Water-ski Association also held numerous water-skiing competitions and galas at Pasir Ris Hotel. These competitions were held every two months at Pasir Ris, and became a spectacle of fun for both competitors and patrons of the beach.16
Post-1965: Towards the Building of a Residential Town
Although there were developments on the beachfront, the residential area and villages of Pasir Ris remained largely untouched. Up until the 1960s, only poultry farmers and fishermen lived in Pasir Ris.17 After Singapore's independence in 1965, plans were made to spruce up the area. This included the building of two community centres in 1966: Pasir Ris Village Community Centre at the 11th milestone of Tampines Road and Kampong Loyang Community Centre at the 13th milestone of Tampines Road.18 These centres became communal spaces that allowed residents to interact and bond over recreational activities such as holiday camps, or classes where residents could learn cooking, ballet, piano, guitar and cake-making.19
In 1974, a private housing company, Kong Joo Pte Ltd, built over 300 bungalows and semi-detached houses around the area of Pasir Ris Hotel.20 Unfortunately, due to a housing slump, the state's Housing & Urban Development Company (HUDC) decided in late-1974 to buy over the unsold terrace houses and resell them at a cheaper price to middle-class citizens.21 Initiatives such as these contributed to the expansion of residential areas. These new residents increased the number of people living in Pasir Ris, which formerly comprised long-time village residents who continued to live in Kampong Loyang and Kampong Pasir Ris until the 1980s, when they were resettled into the nearby residential towns.22
Meanwhile, activity on the beachfront was going strong. In 1971, the People's Association built several multi-storied holiday flats catering to income groups of all levels.23 This was a departure from the days when the options of private bungalows, villas and Pasir Ris Hotel could only be afforded by companies, institutions or the wealthy. These holiday flats built by the People's Association further added to Pasir Ris' transformation from a largely private leisure space to an all-inclusive holiday town.
As for the eponymous hotel, after RAF's exclusive contract ended in 1966, Pasir Ris Hotel was once again opened to the public. Reportedly though, it never quite â€œregained its former popularityâ€.24 This eventually led to a change in management in 1974, with Paul Lim taking over as general manager.25 He embarked on a re-branding effort of the hotel with an emphasis on leisure by the beach and sea. The hotel advertised scenic surroundings, modern sanitation and barbecue pits, and offered boating, dancing and swimming to guests and the public. It even had a tag line: â€œAfter a week in the city, we know just what you needâ€.26
With the need to house Singapore's growing population, the Housing & Development Board (HDB) began land reclamation works along the coast of Pasir Ris in 1979 with the aim of building a new residential town.27 Upon the completion of Pasir Ris Town in 1988, population density was growing in tandem with the development of new recreational spaces.28 The establishment of spaces such as the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) holiday resorts, NTUC Downtown East and Wild Wild Wet facilitated Pasir Ris' sustained reputation as a location for recreation. The NTUC holiday resorts officially opened in 1988 as the largest seaside resort in Singapore, with 396 chalets that could accommodate 1,600 holiday- makers each day.29 In 2004, it underwent a revamp and was renamed NTUC Downtown East. Renovations cost $65 million and two theme parks were added into its list of attractions. These included the Escape Theme Park (closed in 2011) which featured high thrill adventure rides and Wild Wild Wet â€“ a water theme park.30 An entry by Ronnie Ang, as part of the Singapore Memory Project, typifies patrons' memories of Downtown East as a hub for recreation:
Downtown East is the recreation complex in Pasir Ris. With cinemas, bowling alley, shopping centre, supermarket, restaurants, children's playgrounds, entertainment marquee, water theme park and a hotel. A place any one at any age can go to relax.31
Company retreats, birthday celebrations and class gatherings during school holidays became the mainstay reasons for the usage of these recreational spaces. Contrasted to Sentosa Island, which had become an increasingly expensive tourist destination, Pasir Ris provided Singaporeans with a cheaper alternative for recreation. An online post on TripAdvisor made by user Willy Lim echoes such a view:
The rear side of the [Downtown East] chalets is Pasir Ris beach. You can go cycling or spend some time at the beach. Consider it as a more budget friendly alternative to a Sentosa staycation.32
Aside from recreational spaces being constructed, the building of a bus interchange in 1989 and the White Sands shopping centre in 1994 also contributed towards the urbanisation of Pasir Ris.33 These two spaces are significant to the memories of numerous Singaporean families. With the opening of the new Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) in 1999 on the island of Pulau Tekong, located north-east of Pasir Ris, Pasir Ris Bus Interchange had become a fall-in and drop-off point for BMTC recruits.34 Families and friends would often have a meal together nearby before heading to the Basic Military Training fall-in area located within the sheltered walkways of the bus interchange. In an interview with NSman Chia Tai Wei Eugene, he recounts:
Whenever it was time to book in, I would have a meal with my family at White Sands before bidding them farewell at the fall-in area at the interchange.35
Such private moments are part of the collective memory that Singaporeans have of White Sands shopping mall and the bus interchange. These two spaces not only provide Singaporeans with opportunities for recreation, but also give families and friends an opportunity for heartfelt goodbyes and joyful reunifications. By partaking in these activities, Singaporeans unknowingly associate Pasir Ris with emotions of enjoyment and social bonding. This consequently ascribes to Pasir Ris the reputation of a recreational hub which is today embodied by numerous recreation sites â€“ a testament to its longstanding, living heritage. 
Present Day: An Enduring Heritage Shaped by Surrounding Sands
Since the 1880s, the identity of Pasir Ris has always been centred on the notion of a beachfront locale built for recreation and leisure. This legacy is reflected through the ocean-themed architectural designs of playgrounds and parks such as the Atlantis Park and the Bumboat Playground off Elias Road.
Today, Pasir Ris continues to retain its resort-like ambience even amidst its redevelopment as a residential estate. This atmosphere is continually reinforced by urban developers selling the dream of beachfront living, just as Pasir Ris Hotel once did. Whether such an identity will endure the test of time depends on the waves of new residents that now call Pasir Ris home. Nevertheless, whether you think of Pasir Ris as a beach front resort, or as a home by the beach, one thing is for certain: Pasir Ris' heritage has always been shaped by the sands that surround it.

As we reflect on the bicentennial of modern Singapore this year, we should not forget another significant milestone in our nation's history: Singapore's achievement of internal self-government in June 1959. This year marks its 60th anniversary.
To commemorate 60 years of self-rule, this graphic spread presents 60 objects from Singapore's various National Collections which, when taken together, provide a sweeping overview of the story of Singapore from the late first millennium, through the colonial period to the present.
The objects presented here are curated along five key sections:
A) Networks through Time, B) Colonial, C) Community and Faith, D) Art Historical, and E) Self-Government and Independence.
The narrative does not follow a simple chronology of key milestones in Singapore's history, but instead opts for a more complex, networked, hybrid approach blending chronology, geography, cultures and major themes.

60 objects
In choosing the objects to be included, I have been guided by the following criteria:
a) that these be objects in collections owned by publicly-funded national institutions in Singapore;
b) that these be masterpieces of art, or pieces of historical and socio-cultural significance, with a particular focus on pieces representative of significant collections of objects in public holdings;
c) that the graphic spread as a whole is community-inclusive, by which I mean representing all ethnic communities and faiths in Singapore, with a particular effort made in representing the voices of women;
d) that the spread be genre-inclusive, by which I mean representing a diverse variety of object types and art genres;
e) that the spread places Singapore in the larger global, Asian and Southeast Asian context, emphasising that Singapore, and Singapore's history, does not exist in a vacuum, but has always been open to and impacted by developments in the regional and global spheres; and finally,
f) that the objects chosen are on physical display, as far as possible, in the permanent galleries of the institutions from which they come.
This story of Singapore told through 60 objects is thus unique, in that it is global, cross-cultural, multi-faith and inclusive, by which I mean it includes collections beyond the National Collection held by the National Heritage Board and displayed at the National Museums and Art Galleries. The narrative presented here also reaches back further than the now widely-accepted 700-year timeline of Singapore history. The goal of this spread is ultimately to defamiliarise; to allow our readers to see that Singapore history is rich and multi-dimensional, and that as a nation and a people, we possess a wonderful treasure trove in our museums, archives and libraries that we should preserve, cherish and celebrate.
A) Networks through Time
Situated at the midway point between China and India, Southeast Asia has been at the crossroads of maritime trade since the late first millennium. The Tang Shipwreck, excavated off the island of Sumatra, is testament to large-scale intra-Asian maritime trade taking place at least from the 9th century. At the same time, archaeological digs at Fort Canning and around the Singapore River provide evidence that Singapore in the 14th century was already a thriving trading settlement. There are also corroborating accounts in the Sejarah Melayu (The Malay Annals) of a Kingdom of Singapura paying tribute to the Majapahit Empire.
From the 15th century, Southeast Asia takes centrestage in a global tussle among the European imperial powers to secure a monopoly on spices, and thereafter, on luxury goods from the East, in particular Chinese export porcelain and Indian trade textiles such as those in the (former) Hollander Collection of Indian Trade Cloth. Singapore's heritage as a cosmopolitan, East-West Asian port city has its antecedents in earlier port cities like Malacca (Melaka), Batavia (Jakarta), Manila, Canton (Guangzhou) and the cities of the former Coromandel Coast (corresponding in geography to today's Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh states), from which these luxury goods from the East were exported to the rest of the world.
Amidst this theatre of trade, war and colonialism came (English) East India Company operative, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, whose failed bid to secure the island of Java as a British colony became the impetus for his renewed search for a permanent British settlement in the lands (and seas) of the Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate.

B) Colonial
The British settlement and colony of Singapore was established by treaty between Raffles, Sultan Hussein Shah and Temenggong Abdul Rahman. The signing of this treaty resulted in the division of the larger Johor-Riau-Lingga Sultanate, a powerful maritime kingdom, of which Singapore was once part of. William Farquhar, who was appointed as the first Resident, spent more time than Raffles in Singapore, and did more for the fledgling colony in his initial years. Singapore thrived through free trade and drew a cosmopolitan resident population from all across Asia and beyond.
In the course of the century and half that the British were in Singapore and Southeast Asia, they invested in surveying and collecting the region's natural history and cultural heritage, amassing large quantities of artefacts, specimens and drawings that were deposited at the former Raffles Library and Museum (today's National Museum of Singapore), established in 1887. The museum also plays host today to the much older William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, commissioned by Farquhar himself in the early 1800s.
Southeast Asia during the colonial period of 19th to mid-20th centuries was divided and occupied by various European imperial powers: primarily the British in Singapore, Malaya, Burma (today's Myanmar) and North Borneo; the Dutch in the former Netherlands East Indies (today's Indonesia); the Spanish in the Philippines and the French in the former Indochina (today's Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos). The uneasy tension between colonial power and local agency is captured vividly in signature works of major Southeast Asian artists at the turn of the 19th century. This tension would fuel independence movements in the region post-World War II.
But for the time being, Singapore prospered as the foremost trading port in Southeast Asia. The advent of steam-ship and eventually air travel also established Singapore as a pre-eminent tourism destination in Asia, with the Raffles Hotel symbolising the grandeur and opulence of the East. The 1940s and '50s saw Singapore endure the atrocities of the war, the Japanese Occupation, and the aftermath. It was conferred City status in 1951.

C) Community and Faith
Multi-culturalism is a core facet of Singaporean identity and society. As a pre-eminent trading port in Southeast Asia, Singapore attracted, in the course of its history, ethnic and religious communities from all over Asia and Europe. Aside from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Eurasian and various Peranakan communitiesâ€”these ethnicities being themselves convenient amalgamations of many different sub-ethnicitiesâ€”Singapore also welcomed Arabs, Jews, Armenians and Europeans.
Another important core facet of Singaporean identity and society is religious harmony, with Singapore being the most religiously diverse nation in the world. Singapore's Inter-religious Organisation today recognises 10 world religions in Singaporeâ€”the Baha'i faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism, Taoism and Zoroastrianism.
This section attempts to capture and present the cultural and religious diversity of Singapore, with all ethnicities and faiths represented as far as possible. Alongside masterpieces of sacred art, material culture features strongly, with film culture being represented by the Cathay-Keris Malay Classics Collection, which was inscribed into the UNESCO Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Register (2014). In the spirit of inclusiveness, particular effort has also been made to feature the stories of women in the community.

D) Art Historical
A proper art history of Singapore in the context of the Southeast Asian and larger Asian region would require its own full graphic spread of 60 objects. As such, this section zooms in on Singapore alone, featuring primarily Singaporean artistsâ€”one artist from the Singaporean diaspora in the United Kingdom, one pioneer Singaporean art collector, and one Chinese artist who loved Singapore.
An art history of modern Singapore generally commences with the Nanyang Artists, a seminal group of Singaporean painters represented by the quartet of Liu Kang, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng, and the enigmatic Georgette Chen. They were distinguished by their strong affiliation with the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and by their works, which fused elements of East and West in a distinctive ""Nanyang"" (Southern Seas) style.
The Nanyang Artists were influenced in turn by major Chinese artists of the early 20th century such as the likes of Xu Beihong, Qi Baishi, Pu Ru, Ren Bonian, Wu Changshuo. A significant collection of these latter artists' works was built up in the 1930s to 1950s by a pioneering local merchant and philanthropist, the late Dr Tan Tsze Chor, also known as the ""pepper king"". Part of the collection, known as the Xiang Xue Zhuang Collection, was generously given to the state by Tan's family in the 2000s. Around the same period, modern Chinese painter, Wu Guanzhong, regarded as one of the most important modern Chinese painters today, also bequeathed a large gift of his artworks to the National Collection, as a gesture of his strong affection for Singapore.
From the 1960s onwards, Singapore saw the emergence of major artists in various genres such as ceramics, sculpture, painting, print-making and performance art, many of whom have been awarded the Cultural Medallionâ€”the nation's highest distinction for artists and cultural professionals.
A distinct break occurred in the late 1980s with the radical and controversial The Artists' Village (TAV) - an artist colony, collective and movement established by contemporary artist Tang Da Wu, which counted amongst its ranks ground-breaking artists such as Amanda Heng, Chng Seok Tin and the late Lee Wen. TAV, still active today, derives its notoriety from a ban on performance art in Singapore following a performance by artist Josef Ng in 1994 which saw him snipping his pubic hair in public. TAV's complex multi-faceted work defied categorisation and would prefigure today's new generation of local installation and multi-media artists.
In the meantime, the 1990s and 2000s saw significant investment by the government into the arts and culture scene, with the aim of turning around the perception of Singapore as a ""cultural desert"" and re-positioning Singapore as a ""Renaissance City"". The investment in the arts has borne fruit in terms of an extremely vibrant and active arts and heritage scene, with young Singaporean artists gaining prominence on the international stage.

E) Self-Government and Independence
The State of Singapore Constitution of 21 November 1958 articulated the structure of government for a self-governing Singapore, with the post of governor replaced by the office of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, and with a fully-elected Legislative Assembly. Self-government was actualised on 5 June 1959, with the late Lee Kuan Yew sworn in as Singapore's first Prime Minister, alongside his first cabinet. To mark this significant milestone, a new national flag and anthem were adopted.
In 1963, Singapore ceased being a colony of Great Britain by merging with Malaya, Sarawak and Sabah to form the Federation of Malaysia. Barely two years later, Singapore would leave the federation, with the Proclamation of the Republic of Singapore on 9 August 1965 declaring Singapore its own independent republic.
Singapore's post-independence years saw significant economic growth grounded in a burgeoning manufacturing and electronics sector. Heritage brands such as Tiger Balm and Singapore's blossoming into the ""Garden City"" of Asia contributed to a more vibrant lifestyle and tourism scene.
In the 1980s, economic growth was accompanied by advances in the socio-cultural space, with Singapore investing in what continues to be one of the most extensive and radical public housing programmes in the world. The inclusion of a humble bus ticket from this period as the final object in the graphic spread makes a poignant statement on the great strides post-independence Singapore has made, from being a post-colonial, developing nation to today's global, first-world metropolis.
Singapore in the 1990s and 2000s continued to sustain its growth and build on its global positioning through espousing free trade and continually diversifying its economy while enhancing its urban, social and environmental landscape and infrastructure. It is considered one of the most dynamic and liveable cities in the world today.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
This dome-shaped hanging ornament is decorated with ornate patterns and floral vine motifs. It also features seated figures depicting the 10 Sikh gurus with the central and largest one being that of Guru Nanak Dev, with a sunburst halo encircling his head. The remaining nine gurus appear in the circumference of the chhatri, facing him. The chhatri is often seen as a symbol of nobility and the divine. It would have been hung over the holy book as a sign of respect or used during a religious ceremony. This is still relevant in the modern- day context where the priest will place the Guru Granth Sahib (the 11th and Eternal Guru) underneath with the granthi (reader) holding a chauri (fly whisk) as a sign of respect.
The Sikhs come from the Punjab area in northwest India. It is generally believed that the first Sikhs who came to Singapore were sepoys in the employ of the British East India Company. Historically, the Sikhs were generally associated with police and security work. The term ""Sikh"" originally referred to the followers of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, though today it refers to those who follow the teachings of the 10 Sikh gurus.
Most male Sikhs adopt the term ""Singh"" (lion) as part of their name, while most female Sikhs have the name ""Kaur"" (princess). The Khalsa order is the major religious order in Sikhism. Khalsa Sikhs who have undergone the initiation ceremony must keep and wear the five Sikh symbols, namely unshorn hair, a wooden comb, a steel bracelet, a sword and cotton underwear.

Gift of Frank and Pamela Hickley, collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
This is Wen Chang, the Daoist God of Literature. He is seated on a rock with a ruyi sceptre in his right hand, which symbolises blessing, power and health. The beautifully fluid drapery was finished with deeply carved folds, which emphasise the simple but voluminous style of the high official's robe. His portly stature is indicated by the rank badges that were worn by court officials of the Ming (1368â€“1644) and Qing (1644â€“1911) dynasties.
Wen Chang is thought to have lived in the Tang (618â€“906) or Jin (1115â€“1234) dynasties before he was subsequently deified. He was worshipped by scholars hoping for fortuitous examination results. Today, school children in Singapore put letters at his feet listing the examination subjects and results that they hope to achieve.
Dehua, located on the southeast coast of Fujian province, is well known for its production of white porcelain, known to Europeans as 'blanc de Chine'. The earliest Dehua porcelain was produced as early as the 14th century but the production and quality of these porcelain peaked around the 17th and 18th centuries.

Gift of Shirin Fozdar, collection of Indian Heritage Centre.
Born in India in 1905 to Persian parents of the Baha'i Faith, Shirin Fozdar was a staunch advocate of women's rights. She arrived in Singapore in 1950 with her husband, K. M. Fozdar. The Fozdars were among the first to bring the Baha'i Faith to Singapore. By 1952, there were enough Baha'is in Singapore to form the first Local Spirituality Assembly.
In 1953, Shirin was the force behind Singapore's first girls' club at Joo Chiat Welfare Centre. The club taught women English and arithmetic. She also played an important part in the formation of the Muslim Syariah court in 1958. She was elected the Honorary Secretary of the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) in April 1952. In her role as the Honorary Secretary of SCW she also played a key role in the drafting and establishment of the Women's Charter in 1961.
This is a mortar and pestle used by Shirin Fozdar. Mortars and pestles have been used since ancient times for the preparation of spices, food and medicine. In Singapore, mortars and pestles are used by all ethnic communities and is a fundamental implement used in the preparation of a variety of local Singaporean food.

Collection of Indian Heritage Centre
Parsi silver shops in Bombay and Gujarat supplied the Parsi community with ritual articles. In addition, silver items were imported from southern China as well. This box comprises four silver panels lined with an aromatic wood and a silver hinged cover; the silver is repousseÌd and chased with scenes relating to the Zoroastrian Parsis.
Depicted here are the deity Ahura Mazda and priests attending the sacred fire as well as a king- like figure shown sheltered under an umbrella accompanied by attendants carrying fly whisks. The use of the umbrella to denote kingship and the presence of the flywhisk is an Indian rather than a Persian practice. Inside, the box is split into two compartments by a silver partition. The base is plain, hammered silver.
Like the Jewish community, the Parsi community arrived in Singapore early in its history as a British colonial settlement. One of the most well-known Parsi merchants was Cursetjee Fromurzee, who, together with Englishman John M. Little, founded the department store, Little, Cursetjee & Co. (later John Little & Co.) at Raffles Place.
Zoroastrianism is one of the oldest religions in the world, originating in ancient Persia. The largest community of Parsis resides in the Indian port city of Mumbai, with Hong Kong also playing host to a large community in East Asia.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Jains revere twenty-four Jinas, who have attained a state of bliss and transcendence. Jina means ""liberator"" or ""conqueror"". They help all creatures to liberate their souls from the confines of the body. Jinas are also called ""river crossers"" or ""forders"" (tirthankaras), because they have been released from the eternal cycle of rebirth.
This shrine contains a central image of Sumatinatha, the fifth Jain Tirthankara, identified by geese on the throne. He is believed to possess miraculous powers to fulfil the wishes of pilgrims. He is surrounded by the other twenty-three Jinas.
The naked Jinas indicate that the patrons of the temple for which this shrine was made were devoted to the Digambara sect. An inscription dates this to Singh-Samvat 150, which translates as 1263 AD. The Singh-Samvat dating system was used exclusively in Gujarat and the Kathyawar peninsula until the 14th century.
Jains arrived in Singapore in the early 1900s from India. Today they number around 700, with 95% of the community originating from Gujarat. The Singapore Jain Religious Society was established in 1972 with its premises at 18 Jalan Yasin.

The Rare Materials Collection, collection of National Library, Singapore
Edited by scholar, Munsyi Abdulllah (Abdullah Abdul Kadir) and printed in Singapore in the 19th century (c.1840), Sejarah Melayu is the first printed Jawi (Malay in modified Arabic script) version of a 17th century court text, Sulalat al-Salatin (Genealogy of Kings). The Sulalat al-Salatin has been rated as a paragon of 'good Malay' with its narrative style, vivid and realistic descriptions, liveliness and literary embellishments.
In the preface, Abdullah shared that he wanted to make the text accessible especially to students and 'spread the knowledge of Malay language'. The Trustees of the Singapore Institution (present-day Raffles Institution), endorsed the printing of the book. Abdullah's text is referred to as the 'short version' amongst scholars as it spans 34 chapters tracing the divine origins of Sang Nila Utama, the rise and fall of the Melaka sultanate, and concluding with the death of Tun Ali Hati, the Bendahara of the 4th Melaka Sultanate. It tells of Malay kings who departed from Palembang to Bentan and Singapore before founding Melaka. The pages shown above describe the founding of Singapura by Sang Nila Utama.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
This Qur'an from Yemen has a tan morocco binding with a stamped medallion. Its manuscript has 13 lines of text where the first, middle and last lines are written in red Muhaqqaq script and the other ten lines are in black Naskh script. The Muhaqqaq and Naskh scripts are part of the six classical cursive scripts.
For Muslims, the Qur'an is the visual embodiment of the Word of God and is hence considered sacred. The pious desire to beautify the Word of God was a central factor in the development of calligraphy in the Islamic world. One interesting aspect of Islamic art is that the form of expression can be found in a variety of mediaâ€”thus you can find calligraphy in manuscripts or as large inscriptions done in stone for buildings. Every page of this Qur'an has colourful, decorated headers and frames, and gold is used for chapter titles.
In Singapore, a large part of the Arab community has origins in the Hadhramawt region of Yemen. They arrived in Singapore from the early 19th century, when the Hadhramawt region was a British Protectorate. They were involved in the retail and wholesale trade, the Hajj industry and real estate development. A special group among the Hadhrami families are the sayyids who trace their descent from the Prophet Muhammad himself.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
This portrait depicts Raffles in the style of a ""scholar-gentleman"" and administrator. He looks youthful, confident and knowledgeable, and is surrounded by symbols of his scholarly work: the manuscript paper in his hand, a writing desk with paper, ink and quill, and Buddhist sculptures from Java. There is also a romanticised landscape of Java in the background.
The original portrait by George Francis Joseph was made after Raffles returned to England from Java in 1816, where he had been Lieutenant-Governor. In England, Raffles worked on his monumental volume, The History of Java. Its publication in 1817 led to him being knighted and the book was a success in London. The original portrait, commissioned to commemorate his knighthood, hangs today in the National Portrait Gallery in London.
This well-executed copy by John Adamson was commissioned by the colonial government in Singapore and presented for display at the Victoria Memorial Hall in 1912. It hung beside other portraits of individuals important to colonial Singapore. This included a copy of a portrait of Rajah James Brooke - the ""White Rajah"" of Sarawak, with the original similarly hanging in the National Portrait Gallery in London.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
This silver epergne was presented to William Farquhar, the first British Resident of Singapore. It was a parting gift from the Chinese community when he left the island in 1823. The epergne was an ornamental centre piece for the table. It had three branches to hold candles and a centre crystal bowl for fruit. It was made by a famous London silversmith, Rundell, Bridge & Rundell. Such epergnes decorated the dinner tables of well-to-do families in England and signifies Farquhar's popularity with the Asian communities in Singapore in the 1820s.
Farquhar was summarily dismissed by Raffles in 1824 following disagreements as to how the fledgling colony of Singapore was administered. He is today recognised as having had an extremely significant role in the founding and initial administration of the colony.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
The national flag is Singapore's most visible symbol of statehood, symbolising its sovereignty, pride and honour. The creation of a new national flag was therefore a vital task for Singapore's newly elected cabinet in 1959. Deputy Prime Minister Dr Toh Chin Chye was placed in charge of a committee to create a new flag to replace the British Union Jack, which had flown over the island for nearly 140 years from 1819 to 1959.
Dr Toh had firm ideas about the design of the flag. To ensure that the flag would not be confused with those of other nations, Dr Toh studied the flags of countries represented in the United Nations and showed the cabinet various designs for their consideration. After careful deliberations, the Legislative Assembly endorsed the red and white flag on 18 November 1959, together with the state crest and national anthem. The national flag was unveiled on 3 December 1959 at the installation of the first Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State), Yusof bin Ishak. The ceremony was held in the City Hall chambers. The flag was publicly unveiled for the first time on the City Hall steps. The flag was later adopted officially as Singapore's national flag upon her independence in 1965.
The flag consists of two equal horizontal sections, red above white. In the upper left section are a white crescent moon, and five white stars forming a circle. Each feature of the flag has its own distinctive meaning and significance. Red symbolises universal brotherhood and equality of man. White signifies pervading and everlasting purity and virtue. The crescent moon represents a young nation on the ascendant. The five stars stand for the nation's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality.

(Thali / Kazhuththu Uru), Chettinad, Tamil Nadu, South India, 19th century.
Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
The Chettiars are a South Indian community in Singapore originating from Chettinad in Tamil Nadu. They are usually referred to as 'Nattukottai Chettiars' to distinguish them from other groups of Chettiars.
The term ""chettiar"" is a caste label referring to ""merchant"", and the Chettiars were traditionally merchants and traders in precious stones. They later moved into banking and moneylending activities. Their presence as financiers in Southeast Asia grew with the expansion of British colonialism. Many Chettiars emigrated from India to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Burma (now Myanmar) and Malaya (now Malaysia and Singapore).
The early Chettiar immigrants to Singapore contributed much to the economic development of the thriving settlement by providing credit and banking services. The majority of them operated their businesses from the shophouses situated along Market Street.
This large-sized thali (marriage necklace) is used exclusively by the Nagarathar Chettiar community of Tamil Nadu. This type of necklaces usually comprises 35 pieces and are strung by 21 lengths of twisted strings smeared with turmeric. The central pendant, also called ethanam, has four sharp spikes representing the four vedas (knowledge). This is surmounted by an image of Subrahmanya standing with his parents, Shiva and Parvati, who are seated on a nandi (bull). In weddings, the groom would tie this necklace around the bride's neck after the exchange of vows. The kazhuththu uru is a ceremonial thali that is worn during the wedding and special occasions, such as for the celebration of the husband's 60th birthday.

Collection of National Library, Singapore.
Singapore's 1958 constitution was the culmination of three constitutional talks in 1956, 1957, and 1958â€”the first led by Singapore's first Chief Minister David Marshall, and the latter two by his successor, Lim Yew Hock. The Chief Ministers led all-party missions to London to negotiate the terms of a new constitution. The first mission ended in failure over internal security arrangements, but the second and third missions were successful, providing for a new constitution to be written to establish the State of Singapore.
The 1958 constitution provided for self-government for Singapore through a fully elected 51-seat Legislative Assembly and replaced the governor with the Yang di-Pertuan Negara as head of state, and the Chief Minister with the Prime Minister.
Following the victory of the People's Action Party in the May 1959 elections, Lee Kuan Yew was sworn in as Singapore's first Prime Minister. The British were still in charge of Singapore's defence and foreign affairs. Internal security was managed by an Internal Security Council comprising representatives from Singapore, Britain and the Federation of Malaya.
The first local Yang di-Pertuan Negara was Yusof bin Ishak who was appointed in December 1959. He later became Singapore's first President when it gained independence as a Republic in 1965.

directed by B.N. Rao.
Courtesy of Asian Film Archive and Wong Han Min.
Pontianak (1957) by Cathay-Keris marked the birth of Malay horror films as a genre during the golden era of Singapore cinema. The first multi-lingual film, Pontianak, was initially released in both Bahasa Melayu and Mandarin, and later dubbed into Cantonese and English for overseas audiences. Its success at the box office inspired the creation of many other horror films about other figures from Malay mythology. Pontianak, of which no existing films has been found as yet, was followed by two equally successful sequels, Dendam Pontianak (Revenge of the Pontianak) in 1957 and Sumpah Pontianak (Curse of the Pontianak) in 1958. As the first two films are regarded to be lost, the production still featured here comes from Sumpah Pontianak.
The Pontianak trilogy was also a cross-cultural production. The Cathay-Keris film studio was founded and helmed by Chinese business magnate and philanthropist Loke Wan Tho and Chinese Managing Director Ho Ah Loke; the films were directed by successful Indian film director, Balakrishna Narayana Rao, or B. N. Rao, and starred movie star Maria Menado. Menado's real name was Liesbet Dotulong and she was an extremely popular actress in Malaya and Singapore in the 1950s and '60s. Her role in the Pontianak trilogy catapulted her to fame.
The surviving 91 films of the Cathay-Keris Malay Classics Collection have been preserved by the Asian Film Archive since 2007. This collection was successfully inscribed by the Asian Film Archive's nomination into UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Register in 2014 and is currently the only Singapore inscription in the Memory of the World Register. The Memory of the World Register is the UNESCO World Heritage Site equivalent for documentary heritage.

Gift of Equator Art Society, collection of National Gallery Singapore.
Born in 1931 in China, Chua Mia Tee is regarded for his realist portraitures and depictions of Singapore's changing urban and cultural landscape. Chua moved to Singapore in 1937, when he and his family fled the Sino-Japanese war. In 1947, he was a student at Chung Cheng High School, but left mid-way to pursue an art education at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), where he eventually graduated from in 1952. During his time at NAFA, Chua was the student of then-director Lim Hak Tai as well as Cheong Soo Pieng and See Hiang To. He sought to establish his practice through his pursuit of the 'real,' an interest that was cultivated by his encounters with European classical realism, Russian and Chinese social realist art. He was one of the founding members of the Equator Art Society (EAS) in 1956 and took part in its annual exhibitions until its dissolution in 1974.
One of Chua's most iconic images, National Language Class captures an important stage of Singapore's history. Painted in 1959 when Chua was a member of the Equator Art Society, this work is charged with nationalist sentiment and commemorates Singapore's long-awaited attainment of self-governance in the same year. National Language Class depicts a group of Chinese students learning Malay, the newly-designated national language of Singapore.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore, gift of Elizabeth Choy.
This cheongsam with elegant floral prints was worn by Singapore's World War II heroine, the late Elizabeth Choy, when she attended Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's coronation on 2 June 1953 in England. Choy endured torture following her arrest in 1943 by the Japanese kempeitai (military police) on suspicion of aiding the British. She was detained at the former YMCA at Orchard Road, and finally released after 200 days. The clothes she wore during her detention have also been donated to the National Museum of Singapore.
The cheongsam was the favoured formal dress of Elizabeth Choy. As a mode of dress for Chinese women, it was popularised in Shanghai during the 1920s and '30s, when the city was an influential fashion capital. Then, the cheongsam itself was the standard dress for many Chinese women in China's cities, as well as in the cities with large Chinese communities such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. In style, it is believed to have evolved from a long robe worn by Manchu women during the Qing dynasty in China.
The easy availability of cheongsams from Cantonese and Shanghainese tailors in Singapore contributed to the popularity of the dress here, with most working women in Singapore having at least one cheongsam in the 1950s and '60s. Many working women adopted the cheongsam as their work attire because it projected modern and progressive values that they subscribed to as modern women.

Collection of Singapore Art Museum.
Ho Tzu Nyen, born in 1976, is a Singaporean artist who works primarily in the medium of film and multi-media installations. The Cloud of Unknowing is an installation that was commissioned for the Singapore Pavilion at the 54th Venice Biennale International Art Exhibition. In this video installation, Ho takes as his central subject the cloud, and explores its symbolic and aesthetic representation across cultures, history and geography.
Shot within a block of public housing in Singapore, The Cloud of Unknowing revolves around eight characters and their encounters with a cloud or cloud-like figure. The Cloud of Unknowing portrays the characters in a moment of revelation, and here the reference made by the artwork's title is elucidated. The Cloud of Unknowing is also the title of a medieval text presumed to be written by a cloistered monk on the experience and trials of meditative contemplation upon the divine, where the cloud paradoxically represents both the moment of uncertainty and connection with divinity.

Georgette Chen played a critical role in the development of the Nanyang style. Born in China in 1906, Georgette Chen spent her formative years in Shanghai, New York and Paris, where she found success as an artist following formal training in art academies and regular exhibitions. After a brief stay in Penang from 1951-1953, Chen eventually settled in Singapore in 1953 where she taught at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts till her retirement in 1980. In recognition of her contributions to Singapore art, Chen was awarded the Cultural Medallion in 1982.
Painted possibly a few years after her works were selected for exhibition at the prestigious Salon d'Automne in Paris, Chen's Self Portrait reveals her strong and confident personality. Her piercing gaze engages the viewer in a direct conversation. Like her other portraiture works, she composed Self Portrait with an economy of meansâ€”soft dabs of colour to delineate the contours of her face and differentiate the shades of her facial complexion.

It was tasked with building and managing low-cost public housing for the lower-income groups. HDB tackled the housing problem by redeveloping urban and rural areas and resettling people into new housing estates.
In the 1970s, HDB designed a range of playground designs for its public housing estates. The first series was animal-themed while the second wave of playgrounds featured objects and concepts easily identifiable with the local culture.
This is a set of Housing Development Board (HDB) playground prototypes from Khor Ean Ghee, who is the designer of the first playgrounds found at HDB estates such as the iconic dragon and pelican playgrounds. These playground prototypes are his personal copies. Khor worked in HDB from 1969 till 1983. When he was tasked to design playgrounds for HDB estates, the interior designer who had no training in playground designs took inspiration from our local identity. HDB built many of these locally-designed playgrounds in the 1970s and 1980s before it started to import modular playgrounds from overseas suppliers in the 1990s.
Today, many of the locally-designed playgrounds have been demolished. These HDB playgrounds are fondly remembered by many Singaporeans who had spent their childhood days there. They play a significant role in our collective memory. These playgrounds also marked a time when HDB new towns were formed with the provision of many facilities within the residents' reach. Toa Payoh's iconic Dragon Playground is one of two remaining playgrounds of such design in Singapore.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
This is a metal signboard with an advertisement in Chinese for the Tiger Balm brand of pain-relieving ointment known as 'Ten Thousand Golden Oil'. The creators of Tiger Balm were brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, who were born in Rangoon, Burma (today's Yangon, Myanmar). Boon Par took charge of production and developed other Tiger brand products, while Boon Haw packaged and marketed them. By 1918, the Aw family had become the richest family in Rangoon.
In 1932, Boon Haw built a villa for his second wife in Hong Kong. Behind the house, he built an elaborate garden that could be appreciated much like a Chinese landscape painting from the rooftop. Craftsmen well-versed in Chinese folklore were hired from Swatow, China, to build the garden. These same craftsmen then travelled to Singapore to build the Tiger Balm Gardens, or Haw Par Villa (named after the two brothers), in 1937.
Haw Par Villa was built as a residence by Boon Haw for his younger brother, Boon Par. Though it was private property, part of the garden was opened to the public as Boon Haw wanted it to be an advertisement for Tiger Balm products. The gardens were a popular leisure destination till the 1980s and were known for their larger-than-life dioramas featuring scenes taken from Chinese religion, history and mythology. These dioramas were meant to educate visitors about fundamental Chinese values and beliefs, such as filial piety, resisting temptation and evil-doing, loyalty and fidelity, as well as community service, charity, and judgement in one's afterlife. Tiger Balm continues to be a popular local heritage brand today, and Haw Par Villa still stands in its original location in Pasir Panjang.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
Singapore Bus Service (SBS) Limited was formed in 1973 through the merger of three existing bus companies, Amalgamated Bus Company, Associated Bus Services and United Bus. The company became a major fixture in the local public transport landscape and features highly in Singapore's transport heritage. It continues to offer public transport services to the Singaporean public today.
This is a Singapore Bus Services (SBS) bus ticket from the 1970s and '80s, with a value of 45 cents. A generation of young Singaporeans, growing up during those times, would remember these simple bus tickets fondly. Upon boarding the familiar red-and-white SBS buses, they would have had to purchase these tickets from the bus conductor, who would perforate the tickets with a ticket punch to prevent them from being reused on another journey. The value of the tickets depended on the distance travelled. These punched tickets were later replaced by printed tickets.
Printed on the back of this ticket is the Courtesy Campaign slogan and mascot. The Courtesy Campaign was launched by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1979 in an attempt to encourage Singaporeans to show courtesy, consideration and kindness to one and all. The campaign mascot, Singa the lion, was introduced in 1982 and it has appeared on posters, billboards and various media advertisements.
Singapore has launched numerous campaigns since the 1970s to address prevailing issues of the time. Aside from the Courtesy Campaign, other memorable campaigns from the 1970s to the 1990s include the National Productivity Movement, with Teamy the Bee as its mascot; the ""Use Your Hands"" Campaign to encourage students to clean up school premises; and the â€œClean and Green Weekâ€ Campaign, with a friendly frog, Captain Green, as its mascot.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
Zubir Said is among Singapore's most prominent music composers and songwriters. He has composed over 1,500 songs, comprising film songs, popular songs and national songs. He is best known as the composer of the national anthem of Singapore, Majulah Singapura.
He was active as a composer from the 1930s to the 1950s. In 1949, as the Malay film industry was beginning to flourish, Zubir Said joined Shaw Brothers, taking on the role as an orchestra conductor with Malay Film Productions Ltd, one of the production arms of Shaw Brothers. In the early 1950s, he switched to work for Cathay Keris and was its music director for 14 years until his retirement in 1964. He composed background music and wrote songs for selected scenes, using his vast knowledge of European and Asian scores, in particular Malay melodies. He composed musical scores and songs for some of the most iconic and memorable films in Singapore's film history like Sumpah Pontianak, Sri Mersing, Chuchu Datok Merah, and worked with popular artistes including P. Ramlee, R. Ismail and Nona Asiah.
The City Council and Mayor of Singapore made a recommendation to the City Council for Zubir Said to compose a song to mark the official opening of Victoria Theatre following renovation works. He wrote Majulah Singapuraâ€”which means ""Onward Singapore"" in Malay. This was performed for the first time by the Singapore Chamber Ensemble at the refurbished Victoria Theatre in 1958. Majulah Singapura was subsequently selected and declared the national anthem of Singapore on 11 November 1959, with some slight amendments to the lyrics. It was formally presented to the people as a state national anthem on 3 December 1959, the same day Yusok bin Ishak was inaugurated as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
This is an oil painting by John Turnbull Thomson, who served as the first government surveyor in Singapore from 1841 to 1853. A self-trained artist, he produced a number of paintings which have become an important record of the early settlement.
This painting shows a view of the Padang (open square or field) from Scandal Point, the Saluting Battery (a small knoll above the original shoreline since levelled) situated at the edge of Connaught Drive, southeast of St. Andrew's Church (St. Andrew's Cathedral today). The Padang was the heart of social life in 19th century Singapore and is depicted here in its most bustling state in the late afternoon with different communities dressed in their respective costumes.
The painting creates the impression that Singapore was an idyllic multicultural society. However, the representation of Europeans on an elevated planeâ€” on horseback or in horse-drawn carriagesâ€”while Asians are either standing or seated on the field, subtly suggests that it was the Europeans who held the authority in the settlement.

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum, gift of Paula, Lady Brown.
This miniature manuscript is written in Armenian. It contains the four gospels, supplemented by decoration in the form of illustrations, rubricated initials and borders, some in gold leaf. The most elaborate illustrations depict the four evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, with the latter three represented by animals. The presence of the four gospels and absence of the Old Testament indicate that it is the New Testament rather than a complete Bible. Though mostly intact, the original title pages and binding have been replaced. It was probably made in Armenia or by Armenian communities in Western Asia in the early 18th century.
Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity as its official religion in the early 4th century. The religion reached there at an early date; persecutions against Christians in 110, 230, and 287 were recorded by the Roman historians Eusebius and Tertullian. The first Bibles were translated into Armenian in the early 5th century by Mesrop Mashtots, who invented the Armenian alphabet in 406 AD, but miniature Bibles similar to this manuscript did not appear until the early 17th century.
The Armenian community in Singapore has always been small, with no more than 100 members living here at any one time. It includes prominent members such as the Sarkies Brothers and Agnes Joaquim (best known for successfully cross-breeding two species of orchid into a new hybrid, the Vanda Ms Joaquim, which was later chosen to be Singapore's national flower). The oldest Christian Church in Singapore is the Armenian Apostolic Church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, completed in 1836. Armenians in Singapore and Southeast Asia have origins in Isfahan, in Persia (today's Iran).

Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
The custom of chewing sirih, or betel, is an ancient one. It is widespread in Asia, with almost all countries of South and Southeast Asia having once practised or still practising this custom regularly. The word sirih refers to the betel leaf, which is chewed with the pinang, or areca nut. Slices of pinang are folded carefully in a sirih and enhanced in flavour with cloves, slaked lime and occasionally tobacco. The quid is then popped into one's mouth and chewed.
The different parts of the sireh - lead, nut, spice, lime and tobacco - were often housed in an elaborate container such as this one. The distinctive shape of this betel container (kotak sirih) is typical of the form. One of such containers is presented as part of the gifts in the proposal ceremony, or as part of the gift exchange between bride and groom that kicks off wedding proceedings. The technique of tooling thin slivers of gold onto leather mimics the traditional technique of gold embroidery on velvet.
The box is decorated with panels of scrolling leaves and flowers, a pattern known as the sulur bayung arrangement. The neatly ordered composition of leaves that curl in signifies ideals of humility and modesty.
Old museum records attribute the red leather sirih box as having been purchased from Tungku Aisa binti Tungku Yahaia Lingga from Sultan Gate, Singapore, in 1938. This means that the betel container once belonged to a princess of the Johor-Riau-Lingga royal family, who had resided in the vicinity of Istana Kampung Gelam (today's Malay Heritage Centre).

Collection of the Peranakan Museum, gift of Mr and Mrs Lee Kip Lee.
The sarong kebaya was the fashionable dress of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. While it is most often associated with Nyonya women today, it was prevalently worn by women of all ethnicities in the early to mid-1900s. This item comprises two individual pieces.
The kebaya is an open tunic with long sleeves, a collarless neck and front opening. It is a hip- length garment and is gently shaped to flatter the figure. It is fastened in the front by a set of three leaf-shaped or jewelled brooches (kerosang), usually connected by a chain. This kebaya is made from white translucent voile and decorated with lace, which is sewn onto the edges of the plain fabric. Such forms of kebayas were commonly worn from the 1920s onwards among Nyonyas in the Straits Settlements.
Sarong Lien Metzelaar, Java, Indonesia, late 19thâ€“early 20th century.
Collection of the Peranakan Museum.
Eurasian women in the Dutch East Indies were perhaps the first to wear white cotton kebayas trimmed with handmade European lace in the day. Being of a translucent material, this garment would have been worn with an inner, possibly long-sleeved undershirt.
The sarong is wrapped around the waist and functions as a skirt. This kain sarong (sarong cloth) features an array of motifs which includes humans, fans, flowers and umbrellas. It is made of Batik Belanda or batik made by the Dutch Eurasians in Indonesia. The maker of the batik was Lien Metzelaar, a young Dutch Eurasian lady whose atelier was active in the city of Pekalongan between 1880 to 1920. Metzelaar batik is distinguished by a signature motif of seven leaves on a straight branch alternating with four flowers on the border of the kain.

William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, gift of G. K. Goh, collection of National Museum of Singapore.
The William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings consists of 477 watercolours of flora and fauna indigenous to Malacca, Singapore and the Malayan Peninsula. It was commissioned by Major William Farquhar between 1819 and 1823, when he was the first Resident of Singapore.
This extensive collection is one of a kind in the environmental history of the Malay peninsula during the early 1800s. The drawings were designed to be scientifically accurate, with each of the drawings sporting the scientific name of the specimen depicted, alongside the common name in Jawi Malay and English. It is generally accepted that they were painted by Chinese artists of the Canton school of export painting. The collection had been handed down in its entirety to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. It was put up for auction in 1993, and acquired by Singaporean benefactor, Goh Geok Khim, who then donated it to the National Museum of Singapore.
The black-capped kingfisher is depicted with its wings fully spread, about to land or take off from the branch it sits on. It is a common bird in Singapore, often first observed as a quick flash of blue diving into Singapore's waterways for a meal.

The former Raffles Library and Museum Natural History Collection, collection of Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum.
The Raffles Library and Museum Collection consists of historical documents, natural history specimens and objects amassed during the colonial period and held at the former Raffles Library and Museum (today's National Museum of Singapore). In the course of 1970s to the 1990s, the former Raffles Library and Museum Collection was split, with the natural history collection going to the present-day Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, the Southeast Asian ethnographic collection going to the present-day Asian Civilisations Museum, the art collection going to the Singapore Art Museum, and the historical and documentary collection going to the National Archives of Singapore and the present-day National Museum of Singapore. The intent of splitting the collection at the time was because the Singapore Government wished the National Museum of Singapore to function as a social history museum highlighting Singapore's history and multi-cultural fabric.
This juvenile Malayan Tapir was captured just as it was about to take on its adult colours, which explains a faint black and white layer over the typical spotted pelt of the tapir's young. The scientific name Tapirus indicus Desmarest was given to the Malayan Tapir in September 1819, just months after modern Singapore's founding. In the earlier part of the 19th century, Raffles and Farquhar were fighting over the credit for discovering the tapir. Raffles even went as far as to try to block Farquhar's account of the tapir from being published.
Unfortunately, back in 1818, Raffles had hired French naturalists to collect specimens for him. At some point, one of the naturalists, Desmarest copied and sent parts of Farquhar's as yet unpublished account to the renowned French zoologist Georges-FreÌdeÌric Cuvier. Using this plagiarised information, Cuvier published a short account of the tapir in March 1819. Using Cuvier's account, Desmarest then also published his own account, but goes a step further to coin a scientific name for the tapir, adding his name â€œDesmarestâ€ to it for posterity.

Collection of Singapore Art Museum.
Tang Da Wu, born in 1943, is widely regarded as the central figure in the development of 'alternative' art in Singapore. A graduate from Goldsmith College, University of London with a Master of Art, he led a group of younger artists to establish The Artists Village in Singapore in 1988, where performance, installation and painting took place.
Since the late 1990s, Tang has been working on community projects that deal with memory, history as well as environmental issues. In 1999, Tang was awarded the Arts and Culture Prize at the 10th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize and in 2007, he was one of four artists who represented Singapore at the Venice Biennale.
Tiger's Whip, an installation and performance piece, was first presented to the Singapore public in 1991 in Chinatown with the intention of highlighting the plight of the endangered tigers, which are hunted for their penises as Chinese superstition makes them out to be a powerful aphrodisiac. The work shows the clash of such a belief with the reality of extinction.

Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
This is a lithograph of the original steel engraving published in 1828, which was prepared by Lieutenant Philip Jackson based on the plan that he drew up in 1822. Under Jackson's plan, the different migrant communities in Singaporeâ€”such as the Europeans, Chinese, Indians, Arabs and Bugisâ€” were placed in separate ethnic enclaves. However, the various ethnic enclaves were never very strictly segregated. Muslim mosques and Hindu temples were constructed in Chinatown, while Kampong Bugis had become Kampong Java by the 1830s.
This print was published in John Crawfurd's Journal of an Embassy to the Courts of Siam and Cochin-China in 1828. John Crawfurd followed William Farquhar as the second (and final) British Resident of Singapore. After Crawfurd, the position of Resident was replaced with that of the Governor of the Straits Settlements, as Singapore, Melaka and Penang were grouped together to form the Straits Settlements from 1826.

Collection of National Gallery Singapore.
Born in Hanoi, LeÌ‚ PhÃ´Ì‰ (b.1907), considered one of the masters of 20th century Vietnamese painting, was among the first batch of students who graduated from Ecole des Beaux Arts de I'Indochine in 1930. The Ecole, founded by French painter Victor Tardieu, encouraged its students to explore Western techniques of painting while experimenting with local Vietnamese materials such as silk and lacquer. In 1937, LeÌ‚ PhÃ´Ì‰ moved to Paris and held his first solo exhibition there the following year. He stayed on in the city until his death in 2001.
LeÌ‚ PhÃ´Ì‰ was best known for his refined and elegant portraits of Vietnamese women, often stylised in an elongated manner. This painting of two women is a prime example of LeÌ‚ PhÃ´Ì‰'s art, showing an appealing synthesis of East and West. By the end of the 1930s, LeÌ‚ PhÃ´Ì‰ had travelled in both China and Europe, absorbing different cultural influences. Among the European painters he viewed, LeÌ‚ PhÃ´Ì‰ preferred artists of the mediaeval and early Renaissance periods, whose delicate, linear style is reflected in the treatment of the figures in Harmony in Green. The draped scarves, which trail around the figures, may show the impact of Tang court paintings. The use of the silk material as a painting surface allowed the artist to create a soft, luminous colour harmony.

Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
The Raffles Hotel began life as a large old bungalow known as Beach House in the early 1830s, built by Robert Scott. Over the years, Beach House was leased out to families and changed ownership several times before the lease was acquired by the Sarkies Brothers in September 1887. The Sarkies Brothers were Armenians with roots in the Persian city of Isfahan (in present-day Iran). They had made their way to the East Indies (Southeast Asia) via the city of Calcutta (today's Kolkata) in then-British India.
Raffles Hotel opened its doors for operations on 1 December 1887. Under the Sarkies, Raffles Hotel grew into a grand oriental hotel, with new buildings added to accommodate rising demand for luxury travel. By the 1910s, the Sarkies Brothers were at the pinnacle of their success, having established some of the most profitable and successful hotels in Southeast Asia, including the Eastern & Oriental Hotel in Penang and the Strand Hotel in Yangon. Over time, the hotel consistently improved with the use of modern systems and needs (such as an elevator, tennis lawn etc). This uniform top which has the word ""ROOM"" sewn on the left side, would have been worn by a room service staff at the hotel in the colonial days, judging from the buttons on the uniform which has the words ""Raffles Hotel, Malaya"" engraved on them.

Collection of National Gallery Singapore. This work has been adopted by the Yong Hon Kong Foundation.
Raden Saleh (1807 or 1811â€“1880) is regarded as one of the most important 19th century artists from Java. Hailed as the ""father of modern Indonesian painting"", he is known for his Orientalist landscape and animal hunt paintings that are full of energy and emotion. He was born in Semarang to an aristocratic Javanese family and grew up in a very privileged household. Later, he would move to Europe, where he continued to perfect his art and where he attracted patronage from the European elite.
Forest Fire is an immense composition showing animals chased by flames to the edge of a precipice. This relentless and tragic tale of life and death is powerfully narrated through the vivid depiction of the animals and the dramatic use of light and dark on a monumental scale. Painted during the last years of Raden Saleh's long sojourn in Europe, and the largest known example of the artist's oeuvre, the work manifests his technical mastery of the oil medium, realism, and the language of European Romanticism. The painting was gifted by Raden Saleh to King Willem III of the Netherlands in 1850. A year later, in 1851, the king bestowed the title of ""Schilder des Konings"" (""King's Painter"") upon him.
Contemporary readings of Raden Saleh's oeuvre tend to point out the uneasy tension between his being Javanese, and his specialising in painting what are essentially romanticised European imaginings of Asian landscapes.

Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Prominent Chinese philanthropist Loke Wan Tho, founder of Cathay Organisation, presented this mace to the city of Singapore. The occasion was the granting of city status to Singapore by King George VI in 1951. The mace was made by Messrs Hamilton & Inches, Goldsmiths of Edinburgh, and designed by British sculptor Charles d'Orville Pilkington Jackson.
The design motifs were suggested by a committee consisting of Loke, university professors, and the staff of Raffles Library and Museum, which later became the National Museum of Singapore. The silver figures of a Chinese, Malay, Indian and European, linked by a garland of flowers, symbolise Singapore's multi-ethnic population. They stand atop a castle bearing the city's arms. Other motifs reference Singapore's ecology, culture and trade. Completed in 1953, the mace combines both ornamentation and political symbolism with the aim of creating a new sense of loyalty and pride for the people of Singapore at that time.

Tang Shipwreck Collection, collection of the Asian Civilisations Museum.
This large ewer is one of the finest ceramics found in the Tang Shipwreck and is the only one of its kind in the world. The incised lozenge motif with leafy fronds is an Iranian design seen on other objects in the wreck, which suggests that much of the cargo was destined for the Middle East. The overall form of the ewer is based on objects made in metal, as is evident from the rim surrounding the base, and the thinness of the handle.
The Tang Shipwreck cargo contains more than 70,000 pieces of ceramics, gold, silver and other items, of which some 55,000 pieces are presently in the National Collection. The ship carrying this cargo was an Arab or Persian dhow; the ship had been built using techniques still used today in the Gulf, particularly in Oman. The collection is cross-cultural in nature, since it consists of a Chinese cargo bound for the Middle East, borne in a Middle Eastern ship that sunk in Southeast Asia, very near Singapore.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-singapore-story-through-60-objects/colonial/kris/story,"Kris, Palembang, Sumatra, 19th century, suasa, wood, copper, gold.
The former Raffles Library and Museum Ethnographic Collection, collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
Krises have deep symbolic and ritual meaning in Malay and Indonesian culture. A kris' blade is typically wavy, and the number of waves can range from three to more than thirty. Given the pre- Islamic roots of the kris itself, it is widely believed that the wavy form of the blade resembles that of a naga, or snake, in Malay-Javanese mythology.
The kris' hilt is the means by which one determines the style of the kris. Malay, Bugis and Sumatran kris often sport far more stylised and abstract hilts, recalling the form of deities and demons but without the features. This kris from the Raffles Library and Museum Ethnographic Collection comes from the city of Palembang in Sumatra. Old museum records say it once belonged to Sultan Pengeran Syed Ali of Palembang.
The wavy blade is made from suasa, an alloy of copper, silver and gold. The image of a lion near the hilt is a symbol of power and royalty. The hilt and copper finger guard were probably later additions to the weapon. The kris entered the Raffles Library and Museum in 1912 and is part of a larger and significant collection of kris from the region, mostly collected during the colonial period. The presence of a large kris collection also reminds visitors that Singapore has always been a part of the region and continues to have strong cultural links to its immediate neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia.

Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2012
The journey to Semakau Landfill from the pier off Pasir Panjang takes about 40 minutes in a diesel launch with an oil-stained deck and (often) shirtless boatman. For most visitors, the trip begins long before daybreak, as the tide waits for no man and the tug of the moon is usually strongest hours before dawn. In the dark, the vessel swings past the refineries of Pulau Bukom as well as Pulau Jong, a tiny island named after a Chinese junk, before discharging its passengers at one end of a long wharf. At the other end of what was once an islet called Pulau Sakeng is a waste transfer station, a cavernous hall that emanates an air of industrial purpose as huge excavators unload ash from barges into off-road dump trucks.
Semakau Landfill is a place of contradictions, a land of stark yet striking contrasts. Dubbed a â€˜Garbage of Eden', a â€˜Dump Wonderland' and an â€˜Island paradise built on a garbage dump' by visiting journalists on a mission to discover Singapore's unique solution for solid waste disposal, the island is a landfill that defies conventional expectations by doubling as a habitat for native biodiversity. Today in 2012, the landfill is a patchwork of cells spanning 350 hectares, designed to hold the city's refuse until the year 2045 and hopefully beyond. But it is also home to shorebirds, sea stars, sea anemones and rare shellfish that thrive in mangroves, seagrass beds and a reef flat right next to a massive municipal facility. The air is fresh and the surrounding waters harbour dolphins, turtles and countless fish, for the cells contain mostly ash, the output of incineration plants that reduce the nation's trash into inert fragments, and an impermeable membrane prevents the waste from contaminating the sea.
Colonies of magnificent sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica) and colourful corals thrive on a reef flat just beyond the bund of Semakau Landfill.
When filled to the brim and covered by a layer of earth, each landfill cell transforms from a scene of desolation into a growing landscape of grasses, shrubs and trees where flocks of birds feed and roost. Birdwatchers make regular pilgrimages here to catch glimpses of endangered species such as the Malaysian plover and great-billed heron, while the wide open sky above the landfill draws budding astronomers who gather to observe distant stars and galaxies from atop a seven-kilometre perimeter rock bund. This embankment, which encircles the cells and links Pulau Sakeng with Pulau Semakau proper, unites the fate of two small islands with a recorded history nearly as long as that of modern Singapore.
The landfill cells, when filled up and covered by a layer of earth, are soon overgrown by lalang and casuarina trees, becoming lush habitats for butterflies and birds.
BUILT FOR SUSTAINABILITY
The bulk of visitors to Semakau Landfill have their sights set on the natural wonders of its western shoreline, where low spring tides unveil a mudflat teeming with fiddler crabs, sand stars and sea cucumbers.
The stars of many a vist to Semakau Landfill are these colourful knobbly sea stars (Protoreaster nodosus), a locally endangered species that still survives in good numbers on the reef flats by the landfill.
Led by guides from companies such as the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, every intertidal tour of Pulau Semakau is a walk on the wild side, a wade through waters full of sponges, corals and colourful marine creatures at home in this bustling corner of the Singapore Strait. Overhead, reef egrets, brahminy kites and sea eagles battle for hunting rights over tidal pools where shrimp and small fish are trapped.
The pygmy squid (Idiosepius sp.), an inch-long hunter of small shrimp, is one of many curious marine invertebrates to live in the waters around Semakau Landfill.
Today, Pulau Semakau is best known as a haven for coastal wildlife and an outdoor classroom where students, families and nature lovers can see, touch and take back vivid memories of the flora and fauna that live alongside an active landfill. Staff from the National Environment Agency (NEA), which runs the facility, also implore visitors to reduce, re-use and recycle their waste as much as they can, so that the lifespan of the place can be extended for as long as possible. There is a ring of urgency to their pleas, for Semakau Landfill has served as Singapore's only remaining solid waste disposal site since 1999, following the closure of the Lorong Halus dumping ground. Built at a cost of $610 million between 1995 and 1999, Semakau Landfill was a project of national exigency, as all existing dumping grounds were expected to be depleted by the turn of the 21st century and the mainland had run out of suitable sites for storing waste. Sheer necessity, rather than a fad for novelty, thus drove planners from the then Ministry of the Environment to look offshore and envision the possibility of reclaiming the shallow seabed between two islands south of Pasir Panjang to form a landfill that would last for decades to come.
The making of Semakau Landfill also marked a new chapter in the Singapore story, in the way economic growth and social needs were joined by environmental sustainability as a measure of success in the long run. Attaching the rock bund to Pulau Semakau entailed the inevitable loss of a chunk of the island's original mangrove forests, while the building of the wharf and transfer station would result in considerable sedimentation. In response, two scientists, Professors Leo Tan and Lee Sing Kong, then respectively Director and Head of Biology at the National Institute of Education, drew up a plan to mitigate the environmental impact of the landfill on what was already recognised as a habitat of high biodiversity value. Their proposal, to create two new plots of mangroves to replace the 13.6 hectares lost to the construction, was accepted by the ministry, along with the recommendation of another marine biologist, Professor Chou Loke Ming from the National University of Singapore, to use floating silt screens to prevent sediment from choking nearby coral reefs. Today, thousands of healthy young trees grow near the base of the bund, providing habitats for crabs, mudskippers and otters, and serving as bio-indicators of marine pollution, while the waters around Pulau Semakau still support some of Singapore's richest coral reefs, a slice of which can be viewed during public intertidal walks.
Thousands of mangrove saplings were planted by Semakau Landfill to replace trees lost during its construction.
LIFE ON MANGROVE ISLAND
The making of Semakau Landfill was, however, a swan song to the communities who had lived and died on Pulau Sakeng and Pulau Semakau for over 150 years. Observant visitors to the latter's western shoreline will note a sprinkling of eroded piles along parts of the beach as well as the foundations of long-vanished buildings amid the understorey of an overgrown forest. These are the few surviving traces of a village where as many as 1,600 people lived in dozens of timber houses lining the shore, set on tall beams to stay dry during the highest tides.
For reasons unknown, Pulau Semakau was marked as Pulau Barmalang in early maps, such as one drafted by Captain James Franklin of the East India Company in the early 1820s and currently on display in the Singapore History Gallery at the National Museum of Singapore. The island could have been occupied or at least visited much earlier, as archaeologists found 18th century Qing porcelain pieces and older fragments while exploring the place in 1991. By 1844, however, the island was already referred to as Pulo Simakow or Mangrove Island, as documented by a Singapore Free Press report on a pirate attack that resulted in the death of an unfortunate villager. The islanders then, about a dozen strong, consisted of Chinese smallholders who cultivated vegetables and raised poultry. They also burned charcoal, probably made from the wood of bakau or Rhizophora mangrove trees that grow abundantly around the island, and which were probably the source of the name â€˜Semakau'. The original island was flame-shaped, just over a kilometre wide and spanned 2.1 kilometres from its northern tip, known as Tanjong Romos, to its southernmost point, Tanjong Penyelai. To the east was a dense mangrove swamp, while a sandy beach and mudflat faced the western front. In between was scrubland which islanders cleared to plant coconuts, fruit trees and vegetables.
Prominent stilt roots or pencil roots allow mangrove trees to breathe and survive on the mudflat of Pulau Semakau.
More settlers, principally Chinese of Teochew origin, arrived in the early 20th century. By 1955, Pulau Semakau was home to about 780 villagers, both Chinese and Malay, who farmed the land and raised goats and poultry. Those who fished used small manoeuvrable craft called kolek as well as traditional fish traps and nets to harvest valuable species such as bream, mullets, groupers, snappers, stingrays and scads. Some of the catch was consumed by the fishermen's families, but the bulk was sold to middlemen from mainland markets.
Singapore's attainment of self-rule in 1959 and full independence in 1965 was a mixed blessing for the community, for the threat of foreign pirates, and later, the turbulent years of Konfrontasi with Indonesia between 1963 and 1966, prevented them from venturing into good fishing grounds. As a result, some islanders sought new livelihoods in Pulau Bukom, Jurong and Kallang or moved to the mainland. But in the late 1960s, Pulau Semakau received a population boost when villagers from Pulau Bukom were resettled to make way for new petrochemical facilities.
The residents of Kampong Tengah, as the village on Pulau Semakau was called, lived in about 160 houses. Life in Kampong Tengah, though adequate for its time, was primitive by today's standards. Village wells were unreliable, and fresh water had to be ferried over from Pulau Bukom. Electricity was available only in the evenings when a generator was switched on. As there were no sewers, the villagers used communal latrines positioned over the water so that the sea would wash away their waste. Healthcare was a weekly affair provided by a nurse in a boat from Pulau Brani known as the Floating Dispensary.
Serving the village was a mosque, a community centre, a football field, a police post as well as Muslim and Chinese burial grounds. A primary school opened in 1951 with seven teachers, one of whom was former Senior Minister of State for the Environment, Mr Sidek Saniff. Basic education notwithstanding, the children went about barefooted, seldom bathed or brushed their teeth, and boasted dirty fingernails.
The history of Kampong Tengah drew to a close in 1977, when the villagers were relocated to the mainland, leaving Pulau Semakau to the whims of nature for some 20 years.
LORE AND LEGEND ON PULAU SAKENG
Similar scenes of kampung life existed on Pulau Sakeng, an islet barely half-a-kilometre long located about 1.6 kilometres east of Pulau Semakau. Though marginally shorter than its neighbour's, the history of this tiny rock is somewhat more intriguing. The earliest record of the place came from a surgeon, Dr Robert Little (whose younger brother founded John Little & Co.), who surveyed the southern islands in 1848 and found on Pulo Siking [sic] about 30 inhabitants occupying seven well-built houses on the slope of a hill.
Sitting on stilts just out of reach of the highest tides, this house at Pulau Sakeng once doubled as a provision store and dwelling for two brothers, Mr Teo Yen Eng (b. 1924) and Mr Teo Yan Teck (b. 1932), who now reside on the mainland. Photo courtesy of Mr Teo Yen Eng.
Dr Little also noted a narrow belt of mangroves around the island as well as the presence of coconuts and fruit trees. This observation was echoed by the memories of Haji Ghani bin Dualip, a former assistant headman who recalled that the island was once known as Pulau Kelapa or â€˜Coconut Island'. The villagers, thought to have originated from Riau or descended from the Orang Selat (People of the Straits) who once dwelt by Singapore's shores, claimed links with the Johor-Riau sultanate, which once ruled much of the archipelago; older residents would cite a curse that befell the island after the 1699 assassination of Sultan Mahmud II, which barred the islanders from setting foot in Johor for seven generations.
According to local lore, a lady of Riau blood named Keng arrived at the island more than 200 years ago. A woman of doughty temperament, Keng became chieftain after healing the sick and saving the villagers from pirates. The island later bore her name and until it was reclaimed for the landfill, a shrine or keramat on the hilltop of Pulau Sakeng was said to have been her tomb. Like the surviving keramat on Kusu Island, Keng's shrine was reputed to be a source of blessings for pilgrims who paid their respect at the site. Other sources claimed that Keng and her descendants were in fact pirates, which was plausible as the islanders enjoyed a reputation for maritime robbery even in the late 1800s, when men from Pulau Sakeng would raid passing vessels laden with prized goods such as cigarettes.
Only a few families lived on Pulau Sakeng before the Second World War. The population grew during the war as some people left the mainland to stay with their relatives on the island. In the 1950s and 1960s, villagers from Pulau Sebarok and Pulau Bukom also arrived after their islands were developed. By the early 1980s, Pulau Sakeng had a population of about 520, some of whom worked on the mainland or at Pulau Bukom. Others gathered seashells, fished or raised chicken and geese. A mosque, primary school, religious school, clinic, sundry shop and police post served the close-knit community, who lived in about 80 houses on stilts by the water's edge. Until the 1970s, one annual highlight for the islanders was a National Day regatta, during which villagers would compete with their peers from Pulau Semakau, Pulau Sudong and Pulau Seraya in boat races and swimming contests.
On weekends, mainlanders would visit the island to sightsee and photograph the last traditional village in the southern islands of Singapore. But few spent as much time there as Normala Manap, a researcher who visited Pulau Sakeng in the early 1980s to document its ethnography. Asked what she remembers most fondly about the island, she had this to say:
â€œEverything! To name a few, I miss the connectedness on the island, both of the region and in the island. The people had relatives from the Riau islands who came to visit the island by boat. Everyone on the island knew one another. There was great unity in the community and decisions were made together. When there was a celebration, all were invited. Their emphasis was on what's important in life: communication and building relationships, namely the ties that bind. This is also represented in the way their houses were designed â€“ the verandahs always looked towards the village square or thoroughfare; this is intended so one can always greet passers-by.
They also had a very different worldview in relation to nature. They believed that all things in nature have spirits. The trees, water and even rocks have spirits and as a result they treat nature with great reverence. Their knowledge of their environment, the tides, the plants, was intimate; they could tell the weather from the ripples in the sea and the changing hues of the skies. They even named themselves after trees, flowers and sea creatures. Some of their names were also references to their everyday preoccupations â€“ 'Jala' is a common name, which is also the word for 'net', while the name 'Malam' refers to 'night' in Malay. It's a pity that people of this generation no longer get to experience these cultures and ways of life that are integral parts of our history and who we are today.â€
Manap also noted the presence of a white kaolin outcrop as well as a line of reddish coral-stone blocks â€“ unusual structures that hinted at long-forgotten human activity and whose origin was unknown to the final generation of islanders. These and other past mysteries, however, no longer trouble the present, for no traces of the original island survive and the former villagers are now scattered across the mainland, far in mind and essence from their childhood home.
HABITATS IN HARMONY
The story of Pulau Sakeng came to an end in 1994 when the remaining 130 or so residents bid farewell to their ancestral isle before contractors and cranes arrived to turn the place into a miracle of modern engineering and a model for urban environmental sustainability. Semakau Landfill began operations on 1 April 1999. Six years later, following a visit by then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, the landfill assumed a second life as a public showcase for Singapore's ability to marry development with the preservation of natural habitats.
Since then, more than 60,000 people from Singapore and abroad have set foot on a facility where one can find respite from the noise of the city and revel in a vision of how much of Singapore's coastline was like before it was reclaimed for docks, shipyards and artificial waterfronts. Here, on the reef flat of Pulau Semakau, man has left little evidence of his presence, save the footprints of fellow tidechasers and the glittering towers of Pulau Bukom on the northern horizon.
The sea returns to cover the reef flats after a few hours of low tide that allow visitors to explore these intetidal habitats. Semakau Landfill's mangroves and the refineries of Pulau Bukom can be seen in the background.
Nature guides in khaki and rubber booties shepherd their charges down a well-trodden path through the seagrass and but soon struggle to maintain the cohesion of the groups as the eyes of each and every visitor are drawn to myriad creatures creeping, sliding, climbing and swimming in shallow pools and on rocky outcrops. Seahorses, giant clams, hairy crabs, sea slugs, octopuses, flatworms and anemonefish take turns to hog the limelight but there is never enough time to learn all their secrets, for the tide soon returns to swamp the reef, forcing everyone to turn back and head for the bund.
Living in a tube embedded in the sand, a peacock anemone extends its tentacles to feed when the tide rises to cover the reef flat.
Semakau Landfill, as every visitor learns, is a place of contradictions. It is a landfill that is clean and green, maintained with care and devotion to ensure the integrity of the cells as well as the health of its ecosystems. It is a refuge for many rare and endangered species that thrive in the shadow of a colossal seawall. Above all, it is a glimpse into a future in which habitats can exist in harmony with the needs of humanity, as well as a unique chance to witness Singapore's oft-overlooked biological wealth and learn how a country can grow without losing sight of its natural history.

Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2012
In end-May 2012, visitors to the National Museum of Singapore had the opportunity to view a spectacular collection of 260 pieces of gold jewellery, weapons, coins, household and religious objects. These treasures were on loan from two state museums in Ukraine â€“ the National Museum of the History of Ukraine and the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine. Comprising a wide selection of artefacts from the eighth century BCE to late 19th century CE, this exhibition drew upon the material culture of the northern coast of the Black Sea â€“ an area that corresponds to present-day Ukraine â€“ to present a historical narrative of the region, known to be an important contact point for various cultures over the centuries.
Given the rich and diverse material culture of the Black Sea region, the exhibition chose to focus on object form and its use, so as to explore the interactions between different cultures and contrast their artistic styles and techniques, rather than to adopt the conventional chronological approach. Acknowledging the existence of different nomadic groups and settlements along the Black Sea, the display was divided into two main sections â€“ the Nomads section and the Settled section. The former presented ten nomadic groups through a display of weapons, horse-related ornaments, pole tops, plaques, jewellery and vessels. The latter showcased coins, jewellery and vessels of the Greek colonies established around the Black Sea, as well as illustrated the Byzantine influence over the first empire in the region â€“ the Kievan Rus' empire.
Among the selection of gold, silver and bronze artefacts, gold featured prominently in this exhibition. Gold not only reflects wealth and status, its durability and malleability further justifies the nomadic aristocracy's preference for the metal, as did the Greeks in the coastal towns of the Black Sea and the nobility of the Kievan Rus' empire (late ninth to mid-13th centuries CE). The earliest artefacts in the exhibition were the gold pin inlaid with faience and tiny blue glass beads as well as the twisted gold torque, both dating to the eighth century BCE. These are attributed to the Cimmerians, an equestrian nomadic group who inhabited the area north of the Caucasus and Black Sea till they were displaced by the Scythians around 700 BCE. The pin was uncovered in a burial mound, possibly that of a high-ranking Cimmerian nobleman. Its actual use is uncertain; it could have been used as a clasp or worn as a pendant around the neck.

Of the nomadic groups featured in the Nomads section, the Scythians were well-represented by a diverse selection of artefacts in this exhibition. Believed to be an Iranian-speaking tribe, the Scythians inhabited the steppe regions north of the Black Sea from around seventh century BCE and participated actively in wars and military campaigns. Archaeological findings revealed a rich Scythian material culture, including weapons, horse bridles, pole tops and jewellery, many of which were on display at the exhibition. Several of these artefacts could have been produced in the Greek colonies around the Black Sea. For instance, the gold gorytus cover, which is one of the four found in the region, is believed to be manufactured in the Bosporan workshops in Panticapaeum, a Greek town in Crimea founded between seventh and sixth century BCE by Miletus1. It has been suggested that the scenes either depict the episodes in the life of Achilles or illustrate an Iranian epic. The fine details on the gorytus cover attest to the skilful workmanship of craftsmen residing in Panticapaeum.

By sixth century BCE, workshops catering to the tastes and demands of the nomadic aristocracy had also emerged in other Greek towns such as Olbia. With both local Greek and Scythian craftsmen employed in the workshops, it is not surprising that visitors saw a rich blend of influences, particularly from the Greeks, on the objects in the Nomads section. Shared iconography between Scythian and Greek art was also visible on one of the highlights in the exhibition â€“ the gold sword and scabbard stamped with the motif of a stag attacked by a griffin and lion.

Gold was also used to decorate horse trappings, as exemplified by the bridle ornaments and saddle ornaments excavated from tombs. Archaeological excavations also revealed that other than the sacrifice of grooms (male servants) with torques and quivers, horses were also sacrificed during the royal burial process, thereby affirming the importance of these mares to their nomadic masters. Horses were after all crucial to nomadic success and superiority in the steppes, as these animals provided the speed, range and mobility required by nomads in their environment. Equestrian nomads such as the Scythians and the Huns excelled at the Parthian shot, a war tactic in which nomads feigned retreat and then turned back to shoot arrows at their enemies while mounted on horses.

Apart from weapons and horse-related ornaments, the jewellery and plaques in the Nomads section captured the imagination and spirit of the nomads. Notable among the jewellery display was a gold bracelet inlaid with carnelian, attributed to the Sarmatians (also of Iranian origins like the Scythians). The Sarmatians invaded Scythian territories in the early-third century BCE and were responsible for driving the Scythians into the Crimean peninsula. The red-coloured stones in the gold bracelet suggest the Sarmatians' fondness for ornamentation.

The prevalent animal style seen in nomadic art is evident on the plaques. Made in a variety of sizes and shapes, with inspiration taken from both real and mythical animals, these plaques â€“ cast in the shape of stag, horse and griffin â€“ would have been used on clothing, horse ornaments and weapons.

Bridging the Nomads section and the Settled section was a small selection of coins produced in Greek colonies like Olbia, Panticapaeum and Chersonesus. These coins, being an instrument of exchange, serve as a reminder of the economic relations2 between the nomads and the settled Greeks. Though Greek presence in the Black Sea area has been attributed to their need for food and natural resources3, or even as a consequence of overpopulation or natural disasters back in mainland Greece, a more plausible explanation for exerting domination over the Black Sea area is the Lydians' hostile policy towards Miletus and the grim political situation within the city. This resulted in Greek colonies being established in Borysthenes (late seventh century BCE), Olbia (mid- sixth century BCE) and Chersonesus (early fifth century BCE). The colonising activity by Miletus lasted till 530 BCE when the Persians started to conquer these colonies. The Greeks also took control of the rivers, including Dniester, Southern Bug, Dnieper, Don, Kuban and the Kerch Strait, thus the trade routes. In a way, the Greek colonies of the Black Sea region connected the classical Greek world and the steppes on the northern coast of the Black Sea, leading to the creation of a unique syncretic material culture in the Black Sea region. Furthermore, immigrant goldsmiths from mainland Greece brought highly decorative forms to the jewellery through stone inlays and techniques such as granulation and filigree, thus generating variety and excitement for the Black Sea region's material culture.

The Black Sea region remained an important contact zone for different cultures over the centuries, during which there were notable external influences on the artistic tradition. These include the Byzantine influence over the Kievan Rus' state from the ninth century CE onwards. The Kievan Rus' state founded by Oleg, ruler of the Ryurik dynasty between 879 and 912, was the largest and most powerful state in Eastern Europe during the second half of the ninth century CE4. When the capital of Kievan Rus' was moved from Novgorod to Kiev in 882 CE, the city Kiev grew to become an important cultural centre. Then in 998 CE, Vladimir the Great who was in power between 980 and 1015 made Eastern Orthodoxy the state religion of Kievan Rus'. This acceptance of Christianity saw the Kievan Rus' court adopt the manners and fashion of the Byzantine court. The influx of Byzantine priests, artisans and architects to Kiev led to the prevalence of Christian icons, relics and ceremonial objects. This is well-exemplified in the pair of temple pendants with cloissonÃ© enamelled decoration. Worn on the temples (the sides of the faces) of Kievan Rus' aristorcrats, the pendants are depicted with birds, possibly doves that symbolise the Holy Spirit or a design with its origins from Slav art.

The use of cloissonÃ© enamelling was also a technique learnt from Byzantine masters in the late 10th century. With the rise of the decorative arts tradition, the craft tradition in the region continued into the 17th century. A small group of decorative objects from the early 17th century to the late 19th century, produced in Kiev as well as Germany and France, are on display at this exhibition. The decorative arts tradition from Kiev is represented here through the works of Ukrainian master craftsmen like Ivan Ravich and Iosef Marshak. During this time, silver was exalted like gold. Though silver alone reflected the wealth and status of the individual, craftsmen also had the option of gilding the silver objects such that both gold and silver-gilt objects were indistinguishable.

The use of gold and its significance in the Black Sea region was an important focus of this exhibition. The value, aesthetic beauty and universal appeal of gold have not diminished with time. The gold objects in particular reflected a blend of artistic traditions and styles unique to the Black Sea region; testifying to the knowledge and skills of the craftsmen; and encouraging a deeper understanding and appreciation of the cultural contexts and influences through the centuries.

Stella Kon wrote Emily of Emerald Hill, drawing upon her Peranakan family background and experiences growing up in Singapore in the mid-20th century. The play won the Singapore National Playwriting Competition in 1983. It is a monologue about the life of Nyonya Emily Gan, who became the matriarch of a wealthy household through determination and sheer strength of character. In its rich characterisation of Peranakan life, the play expresses a distinctly Singaporean identity.

A critical and popular success both locally and overseas, Emily is the nation's most-staged play. Critics embrace it for pioneering a convincing voice in Singaporean theatre, evoking strong local themes, familiar characters and recognisable patterns of speech. Above all, the play resonates with theatregoers worldwide through the universal values of love and humanity.
The exhibition Emily of Emerald Hill: Singaporean Identity on Stage explored the origins and Peranakan roots of the play, and examined its performance history and legacy in the context of Singapore's Peranakan-language and English-language theatre scenes. On display were approximately 300 objects from over 30 individual and institutional lenders and donors, including Stella Kon, the three major Emily performers (Margaret Chan, Pearlly Chua, and Ivan Heng), and leading local theatre companies such as W!LD RICE and Theatreworks.

A first in national museum history, the Peranakan Museum built an exhibition around a Singaporean play and the story of local theatre. The museum is a space traditionally associated with the appreciation of material art forms. But this celebration of an intangible national treasure from the performing arts highlighted the fact that, as surely as art and objects, Emily of Emerald Hill is a cherished part of Singapore's heritage.
STELLA KON: LIFE AND WORKS
In a cosy yellow corner of the exhibition designed to evoke a writer's study, visitors can get up close and personal with Stella Kon. The playwright discusses candidly her life and works in a recorded interview made exclusively for the exhibition. Her reflections are enhanced with displays of photos, glassware once owned by important family members and copies of her key published works.
Born Lim Sing Po (literally â€œstar wavesâ€), Stella Kon is a descendent of prominent Peranakan philanthropists, including Dr Lim Boon Keng (1869 - 1957), Tan Boo Liat (1875 - 1934) and Tan Tock Seng (1798 - 1850). Dr Lim Boon Keng and Tan Boo Liat co-founded the Singapore Chinese Girls' School; Tan Tock Seng contributed money to build the hospital named after him, and to build the Thian Hock Keng temple, the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore. In the play, Tan Boo Liat is reflected in the character of Emily's father-in-law.
Stella Kon is one of Singapore's earliest and most prolific female writers. Her works are concerned with distinctly Singaporean themes, and reflect her national and multicultural heritage. Besides plays, she has written short stories, novels, poetry, and since 2000, primarily musicals.
SETTING THE STAGE
Stella Kon derived the setting of the play from her childhood experiences in the 1950s, growing up in a house called Oberon located at 117 Emerald Hill. In a part of the exhibition, Kon worked with museum curators to create a space that evokes the interior of Oberon. Mixing fact and fiction, the display re-imagines the setting of the play through a combination of original furnishings from the house and objects from the Perankan Museum. A sarong kebaya worn by the playwright's grandmother (Mrs Seow Poh Leng, nÃ©e Polly Tan Poh Li, 1898 - 1969) â€“ inspiration for the character Emily Gan â€“ greets visitors to this part of the exhibition.

This photograph shows Stella Kon's grandparents and their children - the inspiration for parts of the play.
Three large objects from Oberon, anchored in the memories of the family, dominate the space: an elegant cupboard packed with family porcelain and silver; a standing clock that was a gift to Oberon's matriarch (Stella's grandmother); and a grand, silver horseracing trophy that belonged to an honourable ancestor (Stella's great-grandfather). Close attention was also paid to key architectural details that evoke the look of Oberon: two large pillars were constructed and wall-coverings that mimic the exact floral wall tiles in Oberon were produced. Mother-of-pearl chairs, which were not part of the furnishings at Oberon, are also included in this imagined world of Emily. Embodying the spirit of the play, this installation blends reality and fantasy to set the stage.

PERFORMING EMILY: THE MANY FACES OF EMILY GAN
The remarkable performance history of this landmark play includes over 300 performances over 30 years to 2012, across four continents, seven countries, and seventeen cities. Many acclaimed actors and directors have staged Emily through the years; some of the best-known actresses and actors are Margaret Chan, Pearlly Chua, Ivan Heng, Leow Puay Tin, Neo Swee Lin, Claire Wong, Aileen Lau and Jalyn Han.

The exhibition focused on the first three. Margaret Chan is often considered the â€œoriginal Little Nyonyaâ€, since she was the first Singaporean to portray Emily, and was given a coveted invitation to perform the play at the prestigious Traverse Theatre in Scotland in 1986.

Ivan Heng is the only man to play the role; the high regard he has for the play is reflected in his decision to launch his company W!LD RICE with a staging of the play.

Original posters, photos, brochures, props and costumes of these three Emilys were on display at the exhibition within a space designed as a black-and-white dressing room. In this backdrop of dramatic intimacy, they shared reflections of their Emily journeys via interviews recorded on video especially for the exhibition. A soundtrack of songs performed by the various actors in the play through the years played softly in the background, providing audio to enliven the experience.
STAGING A NATION: ENGLISH LANGUAGE THEATRE IN SINGAPORE
Emily is regarded as a seminal work and a landmark event in the history of English language theatre in Singapore. A long wall of brochures and posters from key local productions in the post-war period through the 1980s provides context for the play. Local theatre was born in the 1960s and 1970s, but remained limited, largely due to a lack of trained full-time professionals, minimal funding, and no critical mass of audience comfortable with English. The 1980s marked a golden decade as these conditions improved, resulting in professionalisation of the scene and creation of influential local productions, including Emily.
STAGING A COMMUNITY: PERANAKAN LANGUAGE THEATRE IN SINGAPORE
Themes of family and nostalgia, and the technique of female impersonation (via Ivan Heng's performance) in Emily parallel issues in Peranakan language theatre, called Wayang Peranakan, in Singapore. It was performed in Baba Malay, a Malay creole with heavy borrowings from the Hokkien Chinese dialect. Wayang Peranakan emerged in the early 1900s and experienced a boom in the post-war 1950s. Casts consisted only of men (as it was considered socially inappropriate for women to perform onstage) until the 1960s, and the plays were usually staged for charities. After a lull in the 1960s and 1970s, the scene became vibrant again in the 1980s amidst a background of heightened interest in Peranakan culture and community in Singapore. Since the success of Pileh Minatu (Choosing a Daughter-in-law) in 1984, Wayang Peranakan has been staged almost every year by Gunong Sayang, one of the oldest Peranakan associations in Southeast Asia.
A PERANAKAN TALE
At the heart of Emily is a Peranakan tale, inspired by the author's Peranakan background. The play makes several material references to Peranakan art of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These objects reflect the varied roles of the character Emily Gan as woman, wife, mother, daughter-in-law, hostess and socialite. Drawing from the museum's collection, key objects were displayed accompanied by significant passages from the play. The objects were displayed in showcases spread out across a large book-like structure, representing visually the simultaneous identities of Emily as a script, a play and an exhibition. An Emily mannequin, dressed in a traditional bridal costume set on a mini-stage, planted the character within the setting. A strikingly unconventional bright pink provided the background, highlighting the contemporary aspects of the play. Pink was a favoured colour for Peranakan art at the turn of the 20th century.
FROM PAGE TO STAGE
A theatrette was specially created for this exhibition to facilitate appreciation of Emily as a performing art. Only six out of the approximately 350 performances of the play are known to have been recorded. Highlights from these six performances were stitched together to create a 12-minute video that looped daily to provide visitors with a taste of the play. The full play could also be enjoyed daily at 3pm. This version comprised videos of five Emilys (Margaret Chan, Ivan Heng, Neo Swee Lin, Pearlly Chua and Leow Puay Tin). Each actor has created his or her own interpretation of Emily and, in fact, the same actor portrays her differently with each new production. This underlines the temporal, personal, and fluid nature of theatre as art. An additional treat in this part of the exhibition was the chance to sit in original theatre chairs kindly donated by the Capitol Theatre in Singapore. On 7 July 2012, a live performance of Emily by Margaret Chan was held at the exhibition.
THE EMILY LEGACY
Emily has inspired artistic creativity both locally and abroad. Some of the products inspired, including paintings, poetry, literature and plays, are displayed in the exhibition. A generation of local young people has studied and performed Emily in schools. As a role model for national theatre, the play has left an indelible mark on some of Singapore's leading theatre practitioners.
Emily of Emerald Hill, first edition, Singapore. 1989. Peranakan Museum. Gift of Stella Kon.
As a pillar of local literature, Emily of Emerald Hill has been frequently referenced in academic works and thousands of youths have studied and dramatized it in school. While distinctly Singaporean, Emily has been interpreted as a symbol of Peranakan, Malaysian, Southeast Asian, and Asian identities. Above all, the play deals with the universal values of love and humanity.
Translations into multiple languages, including Mandarin, Icelandic and Japanese, affirm its international appeal. More than just a play, Emily of Emerald Hill is embedded in the Singaporean consciousness and its cultural memory.

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 1 â€“ Jan to Mar 2011
Africa, the second-largest continent on Earth, covers an area the combined land mass of Europe, North America and China. It is an enormous land mass rich in geographic and cultural diversity, populated by peoples whose histories date to ancient times. Interactions between its innumerable ethnic groups have created remarkably rich traditions as well as an artistic heritage filled with history and symbolism. Yet whether in terms of size, population or cultural diversity, Africa remains an emotionally foreign location to most Singaporeans.
Jointly organised by the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and the musÃ©e du quai Branly (MQB), Paris, Congo River: Arts of Central Africa marked the first showcase of MQB's African collections in Singapore â€“ the result of a Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2009 to intensify cultural cooperation and exchanges between France and Singapore. This jointly organised exhibition ran for four months from 10 December 2010 to 10 April 2011. Featuring over 100 sculptures, masks and other beautifully crafted objects from well known institutions such as musÃ©e du quai Branly, Paris; Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren; the National Museum of Ethnology, Leiden and musÃ©e national Picasso, Paris, the exhibition was a once-in-a-lifetime visual feast for our visitors and an opportunity to experience the rich artistic traditions behind these masterpieces.

The continent of Africa is dominated by two immense rivers, the Nile and the Congo. Winding for 4,700 kilometres through central Africa, the Congo River passes through many different landscapes, from lush equatorial forests in the north to broad savannahs in the south. For thousands of years, the Congo River has also connected people; as the river carried goods and trade, it also linked culture and art. The majority of the people living around the Congo River and the nearby OgoouÃ© River speak the Bantu family of languages.
Dating back to more than 3000 years ago, the Bantu-speaking people migrated southward into central Africa from Nigeria. There were two large waves which resulted in one of the most significant mass migrations and cultural transmissions in human history. The geographical environments where these people settled down often shaped their perception of the world, expressed through their politics, traditions and belief systems. Powerful kingdoms ruled the open savannahs, such as the celebrated Kongo kingdom; whilst independent groups such as the Fang and Kota lived in dense equatorial forests, governed by lineage groups or communal organisations. In spite of localised differences, these peoples remained tied together not only by the Bantu language, but also in certain commonalities in their art.
Map of Congo in Africa
The exhibition Congo River: Arts of Central Africa explored the common artistic heritage of the Bantu-speaking peoples in three broad themes: face masks shaped generally like hearts; statues of ancestors; and the representation of females. The exhibition also included a section on African art's impact on the larger world. In the late 19th century, European collectors and artists were struck by the visual power of African sculpture. The stylised human forms found in Congo sculptures inspired leading artists to venture beyond naturalism. One such artist was Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), who avidly collected African art. A selection of his works was presented in the exhibition to allow visitors to witness Africa's influence in the development of Picasso's Modernist style.
Masks in the Form Of Hearts
Masks in the general shape of a heart can be found all along the Congo River and the OgoouÃ© River to the west. Such masks, mainly of wood or ivory, are usually made by communities living in equatorial rainforests. The forehead and cheeks frame a heart-shaped space that is usually painted white, a colour associated with the realm of ancestors. The white pigment, called mpemba, is made from powdered kaolin, a white clay collected from riverbanks.
A mask would usually be worn at rituals and performances, together with a costume made of leaves, vegetable fibres or textiles. Performances would be accompanied by chants and music. Masked dances were not just entertainment but also served to teach moral values, unify a community, drive away evil spirits, cure sickness, or carry out justice. The wearer of a mask could be transformed into another being associated with supernatural spirits, such as ancestors, heroes or nature. Masked performances were usually carried out during rites of passage (when children become adults, or elders become ancestors) or during ceremonies marking the passage of time or the agricultural cycle.
One highlight in this section was a Kwele mask framed by a pair of long animal horns, representative of benign forest spirits known as ekuk. The horns may be those of the antelope â€“ an important game animal for the Kwele. A skilled sculptor used empty spaces and faceted surfaces to give depth and complexity to the mask. The Kwele associated the forest with the world of spirits or ekuk, who acted as intermediaries between the village and spiritual world. The white paint on the masks was associated with light and clarity, forces that symbolised the ekuk's ethereal nature and ability to combat evil spirits. As supernatural beings, ekuk were above mortal concerns and could settle disputes amongst villagers.

These ekuk masks were used during village ceremonies known as beete that were held in times of need to unify the village against a crisis, like poor hunting or an epidemic. A variety of dances were held during the beete ceremony. In some, the audience participated to foster a sense of unity. Before the ceremonies, young men would hunt, another activity promoting camaraderie. At the end of the ritual, antelope meat and intestines contributed to a ritual stew that was consumed by the whole village.
As such, African masks and other artworks had a utilitarian purpose in daily life. They were not art made for art's sake, but played a vital role in the fate of the individual and the community. An effective object could secure a successful crop, appear at funerals to comfort the grieving, avert evil forces, or serve as entertainment. Such functionality differentiated African art from a Western understanding of art, which prioritised form and visual aesthetic. African art, by and large, was intricately connected to and widely used in all aspects of daily life. In their original context, these objects were replaced by new ones when they became worn. Sadly, many of the traditions recorded by historians and anthropologists may have faded today. No one can be sure if these activities and rituals are still practised in those parts of Africa. Many of them would be meaningless in present-day Africa whilst some have found new purpose in recent times.
The disc mask from the Teke-Tsaayi community, a model of the versatility and extreme abstraction of a human face, is an example of a mask that has lost its original context of use and taken on a new mantle in its rebirth. In its original context, this mask was worn for kidumu dances that were performed to ceremonially assert and maintain the group's social and political structures. The mask is divided into two parts at eye level. The upper part protrudes slightly outwards, with narrow slits for the eyes on either side of the small nose to allow the dancer to see. The masked dancers also wore a ring of feathers and a collar of raffia fibre. Often the dancers were young men who performed strenuous acrobatic dances that included cartwheels.
Kidumu dance declined when French colonial powers began moving into the upper OgoouÃ© region at the beginning of the 20th century and people converted to Christianity. Yet in 1963, the dance was recreated with newly made masks to celebrate the inauguration of a railway line. Since then, the kidumu dance has been held for entertainment, and new masks have been made using traditional as well as new designs.
Ancestor Veneration
Ancestor veneration is an important element of central African culture. Vested with mystical powers and authority, ancestors could be called upon to look after their living descendants. Various communities preserved the remains of prominent ancestors â€“ chiefs, warriors, mothers and formidable women â€“ which were stored in bark boxes, woven baskets, or in the cavities of wooden figures. The Fang peoples of Gabon produced among the best-known and highly regarded examples of this genre. Both northern and southern Fang styles are evident in the exhibition: the northern Fang only carved full standing figures, while southern Fang styles have an imposing head with ornate coiffure.
In rituals to honour ancestors, Fang reliquary figures were placed on top of bark cylindrical boxes containing the skulls and bones of revered ancestors. The bones were thought to provide power, wealth and protection to the clan by retaining the deceased's spiritual essence and serving as a tangible medium for communicating with their spirits. The number of skulls showed the quality of the clan's lineage; a greater number of skulls signalled an older lineage and more power wielded. The reliquary tradition is a testament to the Fang's migratory history, as their itinerant existence made permanent ancestral gravesites impossible and necessitated a portable version of ancestral shrines. The variety in form, detail and surface treatment of Fang reliquaries indicate the cultural assimilation that occurred as a result of their contact and conflict with neighbouring peoples.

Ancestor figures were also carved by some communities to emphasise family continuity, community bonds, and the claims of chiefs to power. Of special note were the Kota reliquary figures used in ancestral veneration: the reliquaries were placed on baskets that held the bones of deceased relatives, serving as their guardians. The Fang Byeri and Kota Bwete associations were responsible for honouring the family or clan's most important ancestors, who were often leaders, courageous warriors, superior craftsmen, village founders, fertile women, and individuals with special talents. However, Kota reliquaries were personalised in terms of being owned by a particular family, named, and identified with certain powers. They were also considerably more abstracted than Fang reliquaries, representing the human figure on a flat, planar surface and enveloping it in costly copper or brass sheeting that reflected the importance of the ancestor being honoured. The shine on the metal plating reflected or â€œthrew backâ€ evil. Brass was a precious material in central Africa because it was mainly acquired through trade with Europeans, and served as a form of currency. Kota reliquary figures were among the earliest African artefacts exhibited in France in the late 19th century. Their radically stylised depictions of the human form had a tremendous influence on the development of Western art.

Compared to the representation of ancestors, the representation of rulers in sculpture was rarer, occurring primarily in the royal arts of sub-Saharan African courts, such as the Kuba kingdom in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Remarkable Kuba king figures, known as ndop, were believed to house the counterpart to the king's soul and served as his surrogate in his absence. Once thought to be literal portraits of specific Kuba rulers, the ndop were actually conventionalised representations, some of which were sculpted posthumously. Their identities were depicted through distinguishing attributes. A key identifying insignia was carved in front of the dais of each statue, such as an anvil or gameboard, which represented a particular characteristic of the ruler's reign. The exhibition presents the ndop of Miko mi-Mbul of Mushenge, the 110th Kuba king, who lived in the early 19th century. His royal insignia is a human figure. The principal feature of this king's reign was a change in social customs, when he legalised marriage with slave women. Kuba ndop, like other royal arts, served as a locus of authority, identifying the elite and conveying messages of power to their subjects. Viewers recognised the ndop as a royal personage through its iconography, such as Miko mi-Mbul's cross-legged pose, the cowrie-ornamented belt, or brass armbands worn only by royalty. Believed to be the embodiment of the king's and his ancestors' spirits, ndop were carefully conserved and venerated by following generations. The practice of carving ndop may have been introduced by a Kuba ruler in the 18th century to replace the worship of nature spirits, therefore uniting his subjects by concentrating their loyalty in the person of the king. Thus, although the Kuba did not have a cult of the ancestor in the same vein as the Fang or Kota, certain similarities between the two practices are evident.
Female Representation
In terms of representation, whether in royal arts or other genres in African art, the image of the female was widespread in certain cultural groups. In the cultures of the savannah, women play important roles as rulers, priestesses, honoured mothers and powerful ancestors. The high status of women among the Bantu-speaking peoples is also shown in the principle of matrilineal descent, or the inheritance of leadership through the female line.
The Luba people â€“ whose economic and political power spread their culture to neighbouring groups, such as the Hemba â€“ were renowned for extensively depicting women in their art. This reflected the high status of women in Luba society and government. In Luba caryatid stools, female figures commonly made up the supporting structure, balancing the sitter on her head and palms. Only the king owned a caryatid stool and had the right to sit during ceremonies. The stool was otherwise hidden in another village when not in use, wrapped in white cloth and guarded to avoid theft or tampering. It was a highly spiritual and symbolic object, not for everyday use, but only brought out for special occasions. The female caryatid represented the female founder, symbolically connecting the current ruler to his ancestors.
As the line of ancestral continuity occurred through the woman, females were also associated with fertility and the cycle of life. By virtue of being child-bearers, they were the only ones deemed strong enough to contain great spirits and secret knowledge in their bodies. The caryatid stool symbolised this belief. Upon the king's death, his royal stool became a receptacle of his spirit, which only a female spirit medium, a Mwadi, had the strength to incarnate. As the living incarnation of the deceased ruler, a Mwadi inherited the king's royal titles, emblems, and residence, receiving gifts regularly from the new king. Upon her death, she was succeeded by another Mwadi to ensure the continuance of the royal spirit.
The female figure in Luba culture stood for different aspects of women simultaneously: their supporting role in society, ancestral continuity through the female line, important women in government, and their sacred association with the spiritual. Female figures also portrayed idealised physical perfection, expressed in very detailed scarification patterns and coiffures on the sculpted figures. It was not unheard of for Luba women to travel all the way to the capital to view a caryatid's keloids or hairstyle to learn what was in vogue. Beauty was profoundly important to the Luba, who believed that beautiful coiffure and scarification indicated a civilised, elegant individual and provided a measure of the person's worth. In most African cultures, beauty and goodness were equivalent. Not only was it a sign of beauty, but elaborate scarification was also an indication of a woman's strength to bear children. Scarification and coiffures were also forms of identification, signalling to others the person's profession, rank, and personal history. Patterns and coiffures were meticulously reproduced in otherwise generic ancestral statues to indicate their identity. Patterns could be combined in myriad ways to create different meanings, and were added throughout a person's lifetime to reflect their new experience and identity.
Punu masks, also known as okuyi dance masks, combined idealised feminine beauty and female association with spirits. Like other masking traditions in Gabon, such as the Kwele and Fang, okuyi masks were painted with kaolin, which was associated with healing, the spiritual, and the dead. The white base and appearance were long thought to be related to Japanese Noh theatre, but the style was indigenous to the Punu and its surrounding neighbours. Yet unlike other Gabon masks, the okuyi were less abstracted and tended towards greater naturalism. Punu carvers based them on the most beautiful woman in the community. The okuyi represents the spirit of a beautiful girl, indicated by the red lozenge scarification on her forehead, returning from the dead to the living world in times of mourning. Although a female mask, it was worn by a male performer in full body costume, who executed astonishing acrobatic moves on stilts in a dance known as mukudj. Once restricted to initiates, the okuyi dance is presently performed in public as a reassertion of the community's cultural identity. By combining the symbolism of white kaolin and feminine beauty, the woman is intricately linked to the spiritual world.

Picasso and African Art
Since the Portuguese arrived in central Africa in the 1500s, travellers have brought African objects to Europe. Collecting increased significantly with the colonisation of the Congo region in the mid-19th century. One of the first displays of African objects took place in Paris in 1887 when some Kota objects from Gabon were exhibited.
The art of Africa was startling to European eyes, especially in the way certain features of the human form were abstracted and exaggerated. In the early 20th century, Henri Matisse, AndrÃ© Derain, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso were inspired by African sculpture to move beyond traditional ideas of realism. Matisse was so intrigued that he used them as his inspiration for a portrait of his wife. African objects â€“ with their refined form, gentle concave faces and abstract yet expressive features â€“ attracted the admiration of Western art scholars and collectors. The concave surface was distinct from the prevalence of convex surfaces in Western art, appearing only with Cubism.
Yet despite genuine admiration of stylisation in African art, Western understanding was limited to the visual and emotional. Artworks were analysed without regard for the original culture that produced them, much less the cosmological context that imbued African art with spiritual and symbolic meaning. Paul Guillaume (1891- 1934), a French art dealer wrote that learning the meaning of African art may â€obscure one's vision of the objects as sculptureâ€.
Picasso's first encounter with African sculpture may have been when his friend Matisse showed him a Kongo figure in 1906. The next year, Picasso saw African art at the ethnographic museum in the Palais du TrocadÃ©ro, Paris. He claimed that this encounter led him to understand what it meant to be an artist. Beginning in 1907, Picasso collected African masks and sculptures, with a taste for startling pieces and objects showing both human and animal characteristics. Picasso initially refused to acknowledge the role of African art on his works, candidly declaring, â€œAfrican art? Never heard of it!â€ Only in his later years did he finally agree that they had a great influence.
Picasso was profoundly inspired by his encounter with African art and its influence is evident throughout most of his artworks in his career. It was one of several factors that shattered the inherited concept that art should imitate nature. Instead, Picasso realised that artists should instead interpret what they see, think and feel. He once said, â€œWho sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?â€ The painting, Dimanche (Sunday) is almost unrecognisable as a human portrait. The artist deconstructed and abstracted certain forms â€“ that is, emphasised certain shapes and qualities â€“ inviting the viewer to reflect on the artist's emotions and imagination. In the exhibition, there are four artworks from the musÃ©e national Picasso, Paris that reflect strong influences from African sculpture, ranging from the early years (often referred to as Picasso's African period, i.e. 1907-1909) right up to 1971, two years before his death.
Conclusion
Recent studies of African art have frequently taken the approach of conducting stylistic analysis according to cultural groups. However, present studies take pains to avoid stringently limiting particular groups with certain styles, and for good reason â€“ not only formal styles, but underlying beliefs are demonstrably shared by various peoples and cannot be limited by group boundaries. Transmitted via trade, travel and warfare, cultures have been absorbed, assimilated and adapted to fit into each community's particular preferences.
Societies differ in their respective details, whether they were ruled by kings or clans, or in the precise adornment of their statuary. Yet unifying themes abound in stylistic formalities, the shared principle of ancestor veneration, the indistinct borders between the sacred and profane worlds, the special place of women in African society, and the importance of masquerades and ceremonies in uniting a community. A survey of African art across as broad a spectrum as central Africa would no doubt reveal innumerable differences and unique aspects, but threads remain that tie them together over centuries of eventful history and change.

There is a multi-storey dwelling which is one of the most highly sought-after â€œresidencesâ€ in Bishan. Home to many, including my great-grandmother, this prime location is always alive with chatter whenever my family visits. Yet, no one really lives in these blocks of â€œflatsâ€. Indeed, far from catering to the living, Peck San Theng is a final resting place for the dead.
The columbarium in Peck San Theng (Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng), which was opened in 1986, is touted as a â€œcondo for the deadâ€, and can house up to 90,000 occupants.  Still, when compared to the Peck San Theng cemetery of the past, which used to occupy 384 acres, this columbarium is relatively small. My great-grandfather, who passed on decades before his wife and the building of the columbarium, was buried in one of the graves in the cemetery. During the government's mass grave exhumation in the 1980s, my family had to dig for my great-grandfather's remains to move him to the new columbarium.1 Unfortunately, my family's effort to locate his remains proved to be futile. Today, he is forever lost to the ground underneath the tall, modern buildings.
Incidentally, my family moved to Bishan in 2011 and we are now closer to â€“ or perhaps even living on â€“ the final resting place of my deceased great-grandparents. This daily reality seems to be fundamental to Bishan's heritage: whether it is inhabitants of Bishan Town or villagers from the former Kampong San Teng, Bishan's residents have always been living with the dead. How then do residents today live, interact, or even reconcile with the dead? And how has this notion of â€œliving with the deadâ€ evolved from Kampong San Teng to Bishan?

Kampong San Teng â€“ A Town Built around the Dead
The name â€œBishanâ€ is the pinyinisation of its Chinese counterpart Peck San (ç¢§å±±), derived from Peck San Theng (ç¢§å±±äº­) Chinese cemetery. Founded in 1870 by three pioneers from Kwong Fu, Wai Chow Fu and Siew Hing Fu prefectures in Canton, China, the cemetery was run by a federation of 16 clans belonging to the Cantonese community in Singapore.2 The cemetery started as a burial ground for the Cantonese, but eventually included other dialect groups and races. As the cemetery expanded over time, it was divided into a series of â€œhillsâ€ and â€œpavilionsâ€.3

To locate a particular grave, one must first find the â€œhillâ€ or the â€œpavilionâ€ number â€“ for example Wong Fook Hill, Pavilion No. 5 (é»„ç¦å±±, ç¬¬äº”äº­) â€“ before navigating through the thick undergrowth within the section to find the grave. This gave rise to the name â€œPeck San Thengâ€, which means â€œPavilions on the Jade Hillsâ€.

Following the establishment of Peck San Theng, people began to settle around the burial grounds. At first, the small community consisted of cemetery caretakers, gravediggers, peddlers selling ritual-related goods and others in charge of honouring the dead. Later on, with the influx of Chinese immigrants during the early 20th century, the community bloomed into a kampong known as Kampong San Teng.4 However, even with the rise of new landmarks â€“ a Chinese school, traditional teahouse, wet market, and an open-air cinema, the highlight of village life still revolved around the annual festivals for the dead, including Double Ninth Festival (é‡é˜³èŠ‚), Qing Ming Festival (æ¸…æ˜ŽèŠ‚) and the Hungry Ghost Festival (ä¸­å…ƒèŠ‚).5

Be it cutting the grass to find the graves, preparing food in the teahouse or setting up theatrical performances or rites, the entire community would engage and interact with the dead during these three festivals. While most would have heard about the Qing Ming and Hungry Ghost festivals, not many people today know about the Taoist Double Ninth Festival. The Double Ninth Festival is held on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. During this festival, people would carry a dogwood plant, climb the hills, drink chrysanthemum wine, and eat chong yang (é‡é˜³) cake.6 Many believed that the higher one climbed, the more successful one would be.7 In addition, Kampong San Teng would also organise theatrical performances (getai), lion dances, and sacrifices and offerings for the spirits. Even secret societies would participate in this festival. However, instead of commemorating Huan Jing, a mythological hero who defeated an evil monster, the local gangs would choose to worship a martyr who died while engaging in secret society activities. For smaller gangs without such martyrs, they would worship a deity called Ah Phoh San (é˜¿å©†ç¥ž).8
Activities that were associated with the dead did not only happen during these festivals. Being next to the cemetery, villagers interacted with the departed on a daily basis â€“ often in various interesting and surprising ways. Children, for instance, played hide-and-seek in the cemetery without fear. Even when they fell into open graves, some would take the opportunity to â€œfishâ€ from the graves! Loh Soo Har, a former villager and teacher at Peck San Theng Chinese School recounts:
As the village area was surrounded by trees, it was not so suitable to fly kites there, so we would go on top of the hills... Sometimes, when we accidentally broke the string of the kite, and had to chase after the body of the kite, we would fall into [empty] graves. Sometimes, we would discover fish in the graves. Usually, people would put a water tank beside the coffin. Strangely, catfish started growing inside, and I even caught a few myself. At that time, we even sold them for money! You could say that we took the cemetery as a playground!
However, it was not as if there was no fear of the supernatural. Ng Su Chan, a former villager, recounts that his friend â€œwalked into a ghost (and had) a high fever... for seven days, but miraculously after seven days, he recoveredâ€.9 Such stories of other worldly beings and mysterious ailments were common and almost every villager had a personal story to tell.
Secret societies, on the contrary, did not fear the cemetery. Rather, local gangs enjoyed a cordial relationship with the dead, resulting in much lawlessness in the area. The origins of this lawlessness can be traced back to Toa Payoh in the 1950s and 60s.
Toa Payoh then was popularly known as the â€œChicago of Singaporeâ€ or the mafia district of Singapore. Much of these gangster activities spilled over to Kampong San Teng, which was considered an extension of Toa Payoh. Furthermore, the quiet and secluded nature of the cemetery made it ideal for secret societies such as Flying Dragon (é£žé¾™) and Harmony Peace (å’Œå¹³) to carry out gangster activities there.10 This is illustrated in several incidences in the 1950s. On 25 June 1950, two men were caught with over one ton of unpaid-duties tobacco. In an attempt to arrest illegal distillers, the customs police, on 20 November 1954, faced off with a â€œmenacing mob of 60 men armed with sticksâ€. The mob surrounded the police, allowing the criminals to escape in the scuffle.

Due to its reputation for housing many secret societies, Kampong San Teng also became the logical place to investigate criminal activities, such as the kidnapping of multi-millionaire Tan Lark Sye's nephew in 1957. These secret societies were also hostile to one another. Armed with parangs and guns, they often clashed with each other on the hills. The police were understandably hesitant to enter the cemetery and rarely patrolled the area, not to mention taxi drivers who avoided the place altogether. Peck San Theng cemetery, in one of the administrator's words, was truly â€œmessy and lawlessâ€.
Seeking Refuge among the Dead
On 13 February 1942, during the Second World War, a critical battle between the British and the Japanese took place on the cemetery grounds. On one side was the 2nd Battalion of the Cambridgeshire Regiment, 5th Royal Norfolk Regiment, 5th Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiments, and on the other, the lead elements of the Japanese Imperial Guards. The first engagement was a surprise hit-and-run bayonet attack at 11.30pm. Shortly after, the fighting intensified and both sides suffered heavy losses. Still, the 2nd Cambridgeshire Regiment managed to hold their position on knoll No. 90 (located somewhere between Pavilion No. 1 and 3). The final orders came on 15 February at 3.30pm: a half-hour ceasefire. Approximately two hours later, General Percival officially surrendered to the Japanese.11
During the start of the Japanese invasion, especially after the bombing of Chinatown, many Chinese â€“ most famously the Samsui women â€“ moved to seek refuge among the tombs.12Their belief that Peck San Theng would be safer was unfortunately false. Not only did a fierce battle take place in Peck San Theng, the kampong was also bombed by the Japanese. Lim Choo Sye recounts:
It was the first time I had... such an experience of seeing how much damage bombs could do to a village... full of attap houses... it was an experience one can never forget, having seen so many houses flattened. A few people died, killed by the blasts, not so much by the bombing. There were a few limbs hanging on trees and all the trees had no more leaves.
Nevertheless, while the kampong cemetery was ravaged during the Japanese invasion, life during the occupation itself was rather peaceful. Compared to the urban city areas, the Japanese left the kampong cemetery relatively untouched. The place was spared due to a few possible reasons: the Japanese fears of offending the dead, the importance of the village as a food producer, and the perception that the rural Chinese were less dangerous than their urban counterparts. Those who sought refuge among the dead recalled that they were never called up for forced labour or screenings (Sook Ching operations) and lived a safe life in Kampong San Teng.13
From Peck San to Bishan
In September 1973, the government issued an order to stop all fresh burials and closed the cemetery. Six years later, Peck San Theng's land was officially acquired for urban development. The notice for exhumation was given in November 1979 and from 1983 to 1990, Peck San was redeveloped into Bishan Town.

Kampong San Teng and its residents were also resettled to other new towns, with most moving to Ang Mo Kio.14 With the dead now occupying a much smaller space at the columbarium, how did modern residents go about living, interacting, or reconciling with the dead at the margins of the town? The answer seems to lie in both the architecture and the urban myths of the town.
Peck San Theng may be physically gone, but its pavilions live on in the architecture of Bishan's Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats. These iconic pavilion-inspired HDB roofs were popularised by Singapore's sitcom series Under One Roof in the 1990s. More than a simple reminder about Bishan's ghostly past, Under One Roof romanticised the ideal Singaporean life: living in a prime location 5-room HDB at with children who were well educated â€“ a marked departure from the taboo of living with the dead.
Urban myths about Bishan are yet another form of interaction with the dead. Just as how ghost stories were rife in Kampong San Teng, new residents of Bishan Town had their own supernatural experiences to share. These myths persisted and were even published in The Straits Times in an article titled â€œIs Bishan MRT â€˜unclean'?â€  
It is late at night and you are on the last train... The train, which is bound for Kranji, pulls into Bishan MRT station and you prepare to alight. To your astonishment, it does not stop. Furious, you confront the driver and demand to know why. He asks you how many passengers you saw waiting on the platform. 10 to 15, you say. He replies: â€œI saw more than 50 people and some were without faces. That's why I didn't stop.â€
Even today, Bishan station is considered one of the most haunted places in Singapore. There are many different stories of faceless, headless, or other worldly beings terrorising the station at night, all fuelled by the fact that the station does sit over former graves.15 Conversely, many also consider Bishan to be a place with good fengshui.16  As Kenneth Pinto puts it,
When the place started getting more popular with people because it was quite central, then things got twisted around... Because of the cemetery's high ground, you got good views, supposedly good fengshui. And, yeah, conveniently forget all these ghost stories.17
Concluding Thoughts: The Dead as a Reflection of the Living
In many ways, the legacy of the dead is reflected in the lives of the living. Just as how the dead moved from jade hills to â€œcondosâ€, the living too moved from kampongs to high-rise flats. What is currently home to some 90,000 Singaporeans was once an idyllic resting place for more than 100,000 Chinese migrants. Yet, in this process of turning squatters to citizens, many former kampong residents feel a sense of longing for the past; a sense that they have lost a familiar way of life, relationships, and people, in exchange for modernity and a new way of life.18 That is not to say that the choice to develop was wrong.

Without having moved the graves, I wouldn't be able to live in Bishan and enjoy its modern facilities. But there is something nostalgic - even for a new resident like me - to be so closely associated with the dead. This nostalgia cannot be substituted by pavilion roofs or urban myths. Perhaps the best way to reconcile with the past to remember its history: just as how I remember the elusive great-grandparents that I ""live"" with today

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2010
Satyajit Ray is best known in the world of cinema as the maker of the Apu Trilogy (Pather Panchali, Aparajito, Apur Sansar), which is regarded as the greatest three-part film ever made. The Apu Trilogy is the most well known work of Indian cinema around the world. It is not so much about the storyline, but how it poetically captured life in a rural Indian village. In fact, the films do not have a conventional dramatic plot, but instead are episodic and follow the rhythm of the lives of the people they portrayed. But few if any apart from devoted Ray aficionados know that he made many more equally great films. Ray's 36- film oeuvre comprises great and near-great films. Unlike his famed contemporaries like Bergman, Kurosawa, Fellini and Antonioni, who made a few â€œbadâ€ movies along with some great ones, Ray never made a substandard, imperfect film. As the noted film critic and scholar Peter Rainer remarked: â€œNobody made films like Ray before him, and it is unlikely anybody will after him.â€ Each lm Ray made is original and unique. No one can accuse him of â€œself plagiarismâ€. What is also remarkable is the incredible diversity and variety in his works.
Satyajit Ray
Biographers of Satyajit Ray and film scholars writing on his prodigious output have tried to pigeonhole him in one way or another. He has been called a Bengali Bergman, a Calcutta Chekhov or a sort of reincarnated Renoir. One critic, Michael Sragow, describes Ray as the most sublime filmmaker to emerge since Renoir and De Sica. In the West, most scholars assume that Ray, artistic and somewhat offbeat, must have emerged from India's large and prolific motion picture tradition. In India, Ray was initially dismissed as a peddler of poverty, someone who made low budget features with foreign markets, international film festivals and awards in mind. The more discriminating marvel at Ray's genius and call him the last titan of the nineteenth century Bengal renaissance. On the other hand, to the post-colonial theorists, Ray is a modernist in the European sense and whose work, after all is said and done, is not really as Indian as Bollywood. A proper appraisal of Ray's cinema and his luminous legacy is still in order.
In 1950, Satyajit Ray was asked by a major Calcutta publisher to illustrate a children's edition of Pather Panchali, Bibhuti Bhushan Banerjee's semi-autobiographical novel. On his way back from London, with little to do on a two-week boat journey, Ray ended up sketching the entire book. These formed the kernel and the essential visual elements in the making of Pather Panchali, Ray's very first film and the one that brought him instant international recognition and fame.
Pather Panchali
At the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, Ray received in absentia the Best Human Document Award for this hauntingly beautiful film with its carefully executed details of the joys and sorrows in the life of a little boy named Apu in a tiny village in Bengal during the 1920s. Instant fame, however, did not bring in its wake, instant fortune.
During his life and filmmaking career, Ray received many honours. In addition to the Honorary Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement, which he received in 1992 in his hospital room a few weeks before he passed away, he was also presented with the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour. Oxford University conferred on him an honorary doctorate; the University of California, Berkeley, awarded him the Berkeley Medal. In 1989, President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand of France went to Kolkata (Calcutta) to personally award him the LÃ©gion d'honneur.
INDIA IN RAY'S VISION
One can identify three major compositional periods in Ray's life. The first period (1955-1964) was remarkable for its robust optimism, celebration of the human spirit and creative satisfaction. Ray was not only directing and scripting, but also scoring the music and taking charge of the cinematography. During this period, he directed, arguably, his greatest films. This period coincided with India's early years of independence and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's experiments with secular democracy based on humanism, internationalism and modernism.
The second period (1965-1977) saw India come under a dark spell. There was war with China (1962) during Nehru's last years, followed by a war with Pakistan (1965). Growing urban unemployment and an agricultural crisis brought about by a command economy created near-famine conditions in various parts of the country. The Vietnam War and the Cultural Revolution in China had radicalised Kolkata's youths, artists, writers and intellectuals. Revolutionary and counterrevolutionary violence gripped the city. Kolkata, once known as a friendly and safe city, became a dangerous place to live. The Bangladesh War (1971) caused an influx of millions of refugees fleeing the Pakistani army, filling Kolkata and its outskirts. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, battling massive opposition to her government, imposed â€œEmergencyâ€ rule on the country. India came under draconian control, but there were few signs of serious protests: people followed orders, the streets looked cleaner, the economy showed growth, and the trains were running on time.
Ray was troubled. The films he made during this period clearly projected a troubled vision of India. The Calcutta Trilogy: The Adversary (1970), Company Limited (1971), and The Middleman (1975) created powerful portraits of alienation, waywardness, and moral collapse. Days and Nights in the Forest (1969) and Distant Thunder (1973), made during the Bangladesh War on the subject of the Bengal famine of 1943, showed rape and violence in a straightforward manner. The Chess Players,(1977) made during the â€œEmergency,â€ used the metaphor of a chess game to show how the king of Oudh, more a poet and composer than a ruler, submitted to the British takeover of his kingdom in 1856 as his people fled their villages. The two short films Pikoo (1981) and Deliverance (1981) raised the issues of adultery and untouchability. Even his so-called escapist films â€“ the Goopy and Bagha (1968) musicals and the detective lm Golden Fortress (1974) â€“ carried messages against wars, criminality and greed. In midlife, at the height of his creative powers, Ray seemed to have adopted a dark worldview. Socially, he became increasingly isolated.
In the third and last phase (1977-1992), Ray's worldview came full circle. In the 1980s he became even more isolated and distant. In the films he made during this period, he related his messages in definitive terms. Unlike his early work, his films became didactic and frank. Gone were the carefully crafted shades of grey. Home and the World (1984), based on a Rabindranath Tagore novel, is a diatribe against nationalism, the mix of religion and politics, and political opportunism and dishonesty. Although the theme is the Swadeshi movement1 of 1905, Home and the World addressed issues of critical concern in the 1980s.
Stricken by two heart attacks, Ray was not able to make films with his characteristic vigour. He made modest family dramas, shot indoors under the watchful eyes of his doctors. He made three films, all based on his own stories, in 1988, 1989 and 1990. The first, Enemy of the People (1988), an adaptation of the Henrik Ibsen play to Bengali language, addressed questions of capitalist corruption and manipulation of religion, people, politics and environment. Branches of a Tree (1989) also addressed issues of capitalism as it impacts family values and ethics. The protagonist, a heart patient like Ray, is obsessed with honesty, mediated by mood swings of music and madness. The third film, The Stranger (1990), literally carries Ray's own voice as he sings in parts of the film. The protagonist is clearly Ray himself. His global concerns are articulated locally. Who is an artist? Who is civilised and who is primitive? The protagonist is against narrowness of all sorts, against boundaries and borders. â€œDon't be a frog in the well,â€ he tells his grandnephew as the film comes to an end.
Ray was a product of the Anglo-Bengali encounter of the nineteenth century. His cultural, intellectual and ideological roots can be traced to what is known as the â€œBengali Renaissance.â€ The Bengali Renaissance refers to the flowering of Bengali arts and culture in the 19th century. As a powerfully creative artist, his craft was influenced as much by the West as by the Bengal School. One can argue that, in the final analysis, he was more than a product of the â€œCalcutta modernâ€ â€“ a synthesis of the East and the West. His creativity, he once remarked, remained grounded both in what is uniquely Bengali and in what is universal.
THE ART OF RAY
Let us try to situate Satyajit Ray in his art. Our primary concern here is with his creativity â€“ the process of creation and the person. Aristotle defined the principle of creation as nous poietikos, the poetic reason. It is a principle that can apply to the creation of the universe itself â€“ the creative act brought into existence something that did not exist before. A human artist, by definition, cannot produce what the Great Creator has done, and produce something out of nothing. The human act of creation always involves a reshaping of given material, whether physical or mental. What are the objective conditions of this given material and its reconstitution in creative work? Philosopher Thomas Nagel has argued that objectivity cannot be studied in just Universalist terms, what he terms a view from â€œnowhereâ€. It must be identified with a positional perspective, a view from â€œsomewhereâ€. In Satyajit Ray's work, there is a creative dialogue between what is universal and what is unique to his objective conditions, between the global and the local.
MUSIC
Music is another profound and uniquely personal aspect to Ray's film art. He said while making films he thought musically â€“ all his film narratives are structured like sonatas.
I argue that Ray, like Tagore, was a modern innovator in revolutionising Indian music. The challenge to Ray came from the music he needed for his films. He relied at first on great musicians like Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan or Ali Akbar Khan. However, he was dissatisfied and started to score his own music. Here he was at his innovative best, first in Charulata, and then in his Goopy & Bagha adventure films.
What kind of music did Ray compose? To what extent is it based on the traditions of India and Europe? What about his poster designs, drawings and costume sketches, book jackets, calligraphy and illustrations? And finally, what about his films?
What in the final analysis emerged in all of Ray's art is his own agency and the originality of his creation. Looking at his designs, graphics, and posters one finds a grand artist assured in the practice of his media and using it deftly to realise the idea and intent. His music has a playful melodic geometry, reduced to the barest essentials, with a focus usually on one or two timbres. The flute presents a series of apeggiated phrases forming a musical signature of its own. One can say the same thing about his films: they show a radical simplicity, concealing layer upon layer of ingenuity and complex composition. These defy all labels, and the only one that seems apt and appropriate is Ray's own unique signature in all his work.
When an interviewer addressed Akira Kurosawa â€œthe masterâ€, he responded by saying â€œNot me. Ray is the master. Not to have seen his films is like living on earth and not seeing the Sun and the Moon.â€

Step into any Ya Kun Kaya Toast or Toast Box outlet island-wide, and you may find yourself being transported to another era. With vintage dÃ©cor and sepia-toned photographs adorning their walls, these boutique kopi (Malay for â€œcoffeeâ€) joints are not just places for diners to savour familiar, comfort food. They are also sites where the history and heritage surrounding local food is prominently displayed. Diners munching on crisp kaya (Malay for â€œcoconut jamâ€) toast are thus invited to experience the coffee shop of the 1960s, which has been designed to invoke the feeling of a simple, laidback oasis where patrons can come to unwind. As the Toast Box website suggests, the coffee shop of the sixties â€œwas reinvented to bring back fond memories for those who missed the good old times, and for the younger ones to experience the feel and flavours of a bygone eraâ€.

Besides their portrayal of the 1960s coffee shop as an idyllic space, such kopi joints also suggest that coffee shops were largely defined by their Chinese ownership. Valorised are the stories of early Hainanese coffee shop proprietors, who by the dint of hard work built up thriving family businesses.

The central persona in Ya Kun's narrative, for example, is Loi Ah Koon. Hailed as a simple man who first started his business with a coffee stall in Telok Ayer, Loi's rags-to-riches story graces the walls of all Ya Kun outlets. With competitor chains such as Kiliney Kopitiam also constructing a similar narrative of Chinese ingenuity and industry, it is no surprise that the coffee shop's past has come to be defined by the contributions of Chinese migrants who, it seems, set up shops merely for eating and socialising at a leisurely pace.
Nevertheless, such a historical imagination of the 1960s coffee shop â€“ as a rustic eatery defined by its Chinese roots â€“ deserves to be explored further. This is because such a static conception of the coffee shop seems to be out of joint with the dynamism of Singapore's society in the sixties. Indeed, this was an age of cultural ferment, during which the everyday lives of Singapore's residents were shaped by a vibrant cosmopolitan modernity. As the term â€œswinging sixtiesâ€ suggest, modernity in this period was closely associated with youth-based, Western cultural fads such as the The Beatles, who used new forms of technology such as multi-track recording to create higher quality records to market their music to a global crowd. Popular artistic forms catering to mass audiences were all the rage, particularly in Singapore, where local bands such as The Quests and The Silver Strings drew on influences of an international import to synthesise new strands of consumptive entertainment. To be modern, thus, was to be in sync with popular trends that integrated both Western and local elements, and to be engaged with a dynamic cultural world that was diverse and eclectic.
As an alternative â€œthird spaceâ€ away from both home and work, it is rather inconceivable that coffee shops were merely tranquil arenas, isolated from the lively cultural verve of the day. Oral history interviews and newspaper articles from that era reveal, indeed, that there was much more to the 1960s coffee shop than kaya and toast.

These sources also suggest that focussing on the Hainanese kopitiam (a mixed Malay-Hokkien term for â€œcoffee shopâ€) alone is insufficient. Rather, one must also examine the worlds of the Malay kedaikopi (Malay for â€œcoffee shopâ€) and Indian teh sarabat (a colloquial Singaporean term for â€œmilk teaâ€) stall, for all were equally dynamic spaces that constituted part of Singapore's public sphere in the sixties. As sites for the congregation of multiracial patrons, coffee shops of the 1960s were not only the domain of the Chinese community as we often imagine them to be. In fact, the multiracialism of the 1960s coffee shop went well beyond vernacular forms. As sites frequented by a globally cosmopolitan clientele, coffee shops were part and parcel of a flourishing cultural scene that produced a vibrant, popular modernity.

In 1960s Singapore, coffee shops that catered to patrons beyond the typical Chinese, Malay or Indian customer could be found all across the island. One notable site was the teh sarabat stall cluster outside Rex Cinema, where patrons as diverse as Eurasian and Jewish folk could be found mingling.

Syed Alwi Road in the Rochor district was also another prominent locale where coffee shops played host to clienteles of a global nature. Mohd Buang bin Marzuki, a recruiter for a Malay bangsawan (a type of traditional Malay opera) troupe, even likened one particular coffee shop along Syed Alwi Road to a port, with aspiring bangsawan performers from as far as Manila congregating to seek artistic employment.

However, the globally diverse patrons that weaved in and out of the Syed Alwi Road coffee shop were merely part of a bigger picture. This is because the cosmopolitanism of the Syed Alwi Road coffee shop was linked to new forms of consumptive entertainment that were popularised by three â€worldsâ€ of mid-twentieth century Singapore. In the sixties, three amusement parks â€“ Happy World in Geylang, New World in Jalan Besar and Great World in River Valley â€“ were at the forefront of popular entertainment in Singapore, with performances infused by a syncretic, East-meets-West flavour. Yet they had an unexplored connection to the coffee shop, for travelling troupes performing in the â€œworldsâ€ would often head out from the Syed Alwi Road coffee shop and return again past midnight to rest before heading home at three or four in the morning. There was even a billiard table at the coffee shop over which the bangsawan performers, comedians and musicians of the travelling troupes would bond. After the Syed Alwi Road coffee shop was closed, another coffee shop at the intersection of Geylang Road and Joo Chiat Road took over this function.

Apart from the coffee shop's links with the three â€œworldsâ€, new pop-culture forms that emanated from the confines of the 1960s coffee shop also demonstrate how closely intertwined it was with a cosmopolitan and outward looking society. One advertisement placed in the Singapore Free Press on 21 November, 1961 by a local band called The Rhythmnaires bears testament to this. Billed as â€œone of the top Latin rhythm bands in the districtâ€, the band's lead musician, Mr Earl da Silva, called for a girl to join the eight-man team, while proudly highlighting the fact that the band was formed at â€œa coffee shop meeting of eight music crazy young menâ€.
Oral history interviews with prominent musicians of the 1960s further confirm that coffee shops were favoured as meeting sites for members of Western-style rock-and- roll bands. Particular appealing, it seems, was the convivial atmosphere surrounding Indian teh sarabat stalls, which were a distinctive feature of Singapore's food-scape of that period. In the 1960s, prominent clusters of teh sarabat stalls could be found near present-day Newton Hawker Centre, Cathay Cinema and along Albert Street. For local bands such as The Checkmates that dominated this golden age of local music, such stalls provided spirited spaces that were inherently conducive to the new, modern forms of music that they sought to popularise. At teh sarabat stalls such as the one near Golden Venus bar, musicians such as Henry Suriya, a member of The Boys, could be found chatting and gossiping about the local music scene into the wee hours of the morning. The 4th mile teh sarabat stall in Bukit Timah was also popular, for it brought together musicians and university students from the nearby Dunearn Hostels. Long before 24-hour fast-food restaurants made its way to Singapore's shores, teh sarabat stalls were already catering to nocturnal youths, who represented a restless, pulsating society, eager to experiment with novel cultural forms.

Besides Western-style music, other mass cultural forms of a popular nature were also birthed from within the coffee shop. Activities performed in and around coffee shops thus provided a good barometer of the rapidly changing tastes of a modern, cosmopolitan society, as hobbyists of new artistic forms gathered to further their craft. One such art form was photography. The Photographic Society of Singapore, for instance, was conceived as the Singapore Camera Club in 1950 by a group of seven men who met in a coffee shop. Picture records from the National Archives of Singapore reveal that this was not a one-off phenomenon. A photo from 1962 (see below) shows evidence of a crowded coffee shop brimming with photography enthusiasts with cameras slung around their necks.

Lastly, the creation of new culinary forms also testified to the coffee shop's role in synthesising various cultures and creeds. According to Vernon Cornelius, the popular Singaporean snack, Roti John (consisting of a French loaf topped with eggs and onions), was birthed when the English submarine sandwich was adapted by teh sarabat stalls operating along Changi Point to cater to British soldiers stationed in the vicinity. Retaining the practice of cutting up a large French loaf into manageable portions, Indian teh sarabat stall proprietors proceeded to give quintessential British fare a cosmopolitan twist by infusing fried eggs and tomato sauce. As stall owners hollered â€œhey, roti (Malay for â€œbreadâ€) â€“ John!â€ as a generic and colloquial reference to the passing European customer, the term gained social currency as a reference to a scrumptious new snack.

To conclude, it is clear that contemporary historical perceptions of the coffee shop as an idyllic, Chinese-populated space merely serving up delectable kaya toast are rather restrictive. The story of the 1960s coffee shop is not only confined to the Hainanese kopitiam, but is part of a larger coffee shop world that was shared equally by its Malay and Indian counterparts. Varied as they were outwardly, together they jointly inhabited a shared social space â€“ one defined by a diverse, cosmopolitan identity. is cosmopolitanism, in turn, ensured that coffee shops in the 1960s were not merely spaces for gustatory consumption. Rather, they had an equally important function as sites of cultural fermentation and experimentation as Singaporeans-to-be grappled with, and embraced, a new popular modernity.

""Black - The most popular and the most convenient and the most elegant of all colour. You can wear black at any time. You can wear it at any age. You may wear it on any occasion. A 'little black frock' is essential to a woman's wardrobe. I could write a book about black.""
-Christian Dior, 1954
French couturier Christian Dior best described the appeal of black in a modern woman's wardrobe. Suitable for almost all occasions, black in fashion, in the guise of the ""little"" black dress, has been embraced by women all over the world since the early 20th century. Some of the most quoted reasons for wearing black are that it is versatile, ""safe"" and easy to wear, elegant, respectable and understated. Black is often seen at black tie events, funerals and at work. It is also the ""uniform"" for some graduates, certain religious figures, professionals like lawyers and judges, classical musicians and subculture groups like Punk and Goth.
Beauty in Black attempted to examine why women and fashion designers in general love black through a display of black dresses that date from the 1950s to the 2000s. The collection, on exhibit for the first time at the National Museum of Singapore, comprised acquisitions and donations made since 2004 and included creations by leading Western fashion designers like like CristÃ³bal Balenciaga, Hubert de Givenchy, Pierre Cardin, Azzedine AlaÃ¯a, Karl Lagerfeld amongst others as well as Singaporean designers such as Benny Ong and Thomas Wee. It also consisted of garments made locally for Singaporean women during the 1950s and 1960s before ready-to-wear became popular in the 1970s. The sheer variety of fabrics, styles and effects presented in these black dresses allowed visitors to examine closely the creative works and skills of these selected designers.
THE MODERN BLACK DRESS
Prior to the 1900s, black was largely regarded in the West as the â€œgarb of mourning and woe and the emblem of death and destruction.â€1 Similarly in Asia, including Singapore, it was taboo, inauspicious and closely associated to mourning. Black was only popularly accepted as a colour that symbolises fashion, modernity and productivity amongst women in the West in the 1920s.
Two major events â€“ Britain's â€˜Black Ascot' (1910) and the First World War (1914â€“1918) were credited for changing the cultural status of black. The former referred to the royal racing event of 1910 which saw participants parading in black finery even as the nation mourned the death of King Edward II, hence raising the status of the colour black with luxury and haute couture. When war broke out in 1914, women adopted the wearing of the simple black mourning attire as a result of economic constraints and the need to be mobile and productive at work. This change was documented in both elite and the working class fashion publications by the 1920s which frequently portrayed models in black dresses and referred to these as fashionable, elegant and distinct.2
The black dress comes in various forms. It can be severe, fun or glamorous, hence allowing women the option to choose the appropriate look they want to project at various occasions.

One of the most famous style icons associated with the black dress is the French designer, Gabrielle â€œCocoâ€ Chanel (1883-1971). In 1926, she declared black to be the only appropriate colour for a standardised, economically perfect attire.3 Although the â€œlittleâ€ black dress was already widely adopted by women from the working and middle classes as both a working garment and a party wear before 1926, the image of Chanel in a simple â€œlittle black dressâ€ and a bobbed hairdo made her synonymous with the garment. Her look was interpreted as stylish and liberating and it soon became copied by women of all classes. By the late 1920s, the black dress had become a staple in the modern woman's wardrobe.

Over the years, there are some notable fashion designers who are indissolubly associated with black. One of them is CristÃ³bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), who according to Jacqueline Dermornex (the author of Balenciaga, 1989), observed that â€˜every collection featured the discreet appearance of a little black dress made entirely by Balenciaga.'4 Not one who was interested in following fashion trends, Balenciaga saw black as most appropriate in his quest to create dramatic and timeless classics using different types of fabrics and details. For example, he liked to layer black lace over satin so as to give the dress texture and emphasise the pattern of the lace. The designer's Spanish roots also provided him with much inspiration for black in fashion. Featured in Beauty in Black was a 1960s satin sleeveless tunic dress overlaid in black lace completely embroidered with sequins and jet-like beads highlighted with silver lurex threads. It comes with a matching matador cape, which reminds one of the traditional costume worn by bullfighters in Spain.
In the 1960s, the youth revolution took the world by storm and black dresses were no longer restricted to older women. This tailored black mini dress with a bolero laced jacket is embellished with sequins at the bodice, making it young and trendy. Donated by Chin May Nah. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Until the late 1980s, Japanese fashion designer Rei Kawakubo (b.1942) had never worked with other colours except black since the launch of her label, Comme des Garcons (1975). For the designer, black helps to conceal the shape of the female body, which is of absolute contrast to the taste and aesthetics of western European fashion. In 1983, her fashion collection shocked Paris and the fashion world. According to Suzy Menkes, fashion writer and Editor for International Herald Tribune since 1988, she sent â€œdown the catwalk, marching to a rhythmic beat like a race of warrior women, came models wearing ink-black coat dresses.â€5 Although most fashion journalists then found her black collection depressing, Kawabuko commented that she felt most comfortable in black. â€œI don't understand the term â€˜body conscious' very well. I enter the process from the clothing and from the feeling of volume you get from the clothing, which is probably different from the pleasure Western women take in showing the shapes of their bodies.â€6 The preference for black as a non-colour which does not interfere with the form and identity of the wearer prevailed in Kawabuko's designs even when she started to experiment with other colours after 1988.
The iconic status of black, as seen in fashion, is reflected through its various forms in Beauty in Black. The first group of austere and unadorned black dresses permitted the visitors to admire the pieces as they are, characterised only by their cut, drape, pleats and seams. This concept of the plain black dress is probably similar to the one advocated by Chanel in the 1920s.
Placed next to this group was a set of embellished black dresses made in various fabrics. Very often, designers take advantage of light descending on monochrome black designs with embroidery and needlework to create eye-catching pieces that allow the wearer to stand out in the crowd. For example, the dull black cheongsam can be transformed into a glamorous evening wear using gold sequins embroidered on the dress. Fabrics such as lace and velvet also have the ability to translate the otherwise austere black dress into a luxury wear appropriate for formal black tie events.

Sometimes, colours are employed to break the severity of black (which absorbs all light). Not only do colours help to liven up the dress but they also assist the designer to emphasise the graphic character of the outfit. For example, Singaporean fashion designer Benny Ong used two contrasting colours, black and white in his 1987 taffeta silk cocktail bustier dress to highlight its silhouette.
Designer Benny Ong manipulates two extreme colours, black (absorption of all light) and white (reflection of all light) to enhance the bow detailing and the symmetrical silhouette of this 1987 bustier cocktail dress. Donated by Benny Ong. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Corresponding to these various groups of dresses was an ensemble of cheongsam worn by Singaporean women from the 1950s to 1980s. Singapore's rapid development as a modern and industrialised nation at the end of Second World War resulted in the growth of an increasingly westernised society. As more and more Singaporean women became educated and stepped out of their homes to work, they became exposed to western influences. A major indication of this phenomenon is the clothes they wore. While some women began to prefer western frocks to traditional garments, others adapted the figure-revealing silhouette popular in the West into their previously loose fitting traditional garments.
In 1961, the simple, sleeveless sheath dress worn by socialite Holly Golighty (played by Audrey Hepburn) in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's became the most famous little black dress in the history of cinema. Black made its way into youth fashion by the 1960s and was constantly featured in Optical Art and geometric dresses. Beauty in Black demonstrated that women's affections for the black dress did not waver over the years, despite constant changes in fashion trends and the numerous transformations it underwent. Black, in fashion, had remained and will continue to be a modern Singaporean woman's â€œbest friendâ€, like everywhere else.

BeMuse Volume 5 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2012
The passage of time opens a window for hindsight to enter, allowing us the privilege of retrospection. In this context, a pivotal event like the fall of Singapore to the Japanese army on 15 February 1942 and subsequent military occupation by the Japanese has invoked, over the years, a long and still unending river of memories, publications, documentaries, public exhibitions and other forms of remembrance, so much so that it could arguably be regarded as ""the most remembered event"" in the history of Singapore.
The long shadow of 1942
The conquest of Singapore was linked to a chain of Japanese attacks which began with dramatic speed from the last hours of 7 December 1941 into the dawn of 8 December 1941. Within this short period of time, the Japanese military struck across 6,000 mils of ocean westward from Hawaii to Wake to Guam to Hong Kong to the Philippines to Malaya and Siam1. The first months of 1942 marked the peak of the Japanese military conquest not only of Singapore, but also of the European colonial territories in the Pacific region.
The conquest in 1942 marked the end of one formative phase of Singapore's history and the beginning of another. The earlier phase began in 1819 when the island was established as an entrepot by the British and Malay chiefs. It had developed into Southeast Asia's premier city by the time of the Japanese invasion. The Japanese victory overthrew more than 120 years of continuous colonial rule and abruptly ended this phase in Singapore's history.
1942 also marked the beginning of the phase in Singapore's history that could be considered as a generative process. The abrupt break from colonial rule in 1942, coupled with the experiences of defeat and occupation, contributed to a process of political awakening. This was reflected in the struggle for decolonization over the decade following the surrender of Japan in 1945.
Japanese invasion and British surrender
The invasion started in early-December 1941 with the first Japanese aerial bombing of Singapore, and ended on 15 February 1942 with the British surrender. During this period of about two and a half months, the entire population of disparate migrant communities, as well as the colonial establishment, witnessed or experienced the full-scale horrors of modern war on the island. Among those were aerial and artillery bombardment, the sight of abandoned corpses of those killed in the fighting or bombing, the flight of refugees from the peninsular to the island, family separations in the midst of flight, as well as incidents of rape. With the impending British defeat, many foreigners and locals took flight in small vessels, desperately seeking the safety of Australia or British India, while last pockets of resistance against the invaders persisted amid the chaos and confusion of collapse.
The imminent danger following the surrender was looting2. A desolate sense of abandonment can still be felt in this account of the scene at the landmark Fullerton Building:
""... Doors, desks, cupboards, safes, and suitcases had been broken open, their content strewn everywhere over piles of empty tins and human ordure: it is a blessing that walls cannot speak or Fullerton Building would never cease from shame. Clothes, shoes, notebooks, diaries, letters, wills, bank books, insurance policies, photographs of loved ones, and all manner of personal articles...lay in utter confusion. Pictures of children were trampled into the crumpled pages of a Bible; socks were soaked in the juices of empty tins; a can opener ripped through shirts; trousers and coats were torn apart as if the looters had fought. Such was the demise of Raffles' settlement.""
  The Japanese Occupation
The British surrender was followed by three years and eight months of Japanese military occupation. The period began on an ominous note. Screening and collective punishment was imposed on the Chinese community, resulting in the massacre of thousands of Chinese males during the Sook Ching incident. Monetary contributions were also forced from the Chinese community as a â€œtoken of atonementâ€. Thousands of defeated Allied soldiers were imprisoned and many were sent to work on the Death Railway. Looters were executed and their heads put on public display. In the course of the occupation, food rationing was imposed and the black market came into operation as a result. Many Eurasians were re-settled under agricultural land schemes in Endau and Bahau to grow food. An Indian National Army was also formed out of defeated British Indian Army soldiers as well as local volunteers to fight for India's independence from British rule.
Spies, informers and confessions under torture became a dreaded phenomenon during this period of time. As the experiences of invasion, defeat and occupation had significantly altered the fates of thousands of individuals, the oral history recordings of a generation of survivors deposited in the National Archives of Singapore still constitute an emotionally moving account of what it meant to undergo and experience the â€œlived timeâ€ of 1942 and after.
Landscape of Memories
1942 and its three subsequent years are remembered in contemporary Singapore through a variety of â€œlandscapes of memoriesâ€. Among these are memorial sites such as the Kranji War Memorial, the Memorial to the Civilian Victims of the Japanese Occupation, as well as other locations where the war and occupation left its traces, including the Changi Murals and the Johore Battery site. There are also markers of the Japanese landing sites at Sarimbun and Kranji, and that of the Indian National Army Monument. Permanent displays such as the Memories at Old Ford Factory, Reflections at Bukit Chandu, Changi Museum, the Surrender Chambers at Sentosa and The Battle Box, together with guided battlefield tours and trails relating to 1942, are also additional aspects of this landscape.
Apart from these, there are other links in this landscape which bear the marks of â€œFortress Singaporeâ€, a term popularly used in the pre-World War II period to refer to the chain of coastal fortifications, airfields, garrison barracks and the naval base, constructed as a deterrence against enemy invasion. These former defences include the preserved coastal fortifications at Fort Siloso on Sentosa; the former Royal Air Force airfields at Tengah, Seletar and Sembawang; the remnant structure of the former Naval Base; the Admiralty House; Command House; the military barracks at Selarang and Gillman; as well as traces of the Base Ordnance Depot at Alexandra.
It can be seen that 1942 and after have left a deep imprint on the landscape. These sites and traces on the surface, underground (tunnels and former ammunition storage areas), and along the shoreline (former dock structures of the naval base) are indications that this relatively short period of time has â€“ more than any other period in Singapore's history â€“ left behind what can be regarded as the most enduring heritage landscape in Singapore, cast by â€œthe long shadow of 1942â€.
Conclusion
The years since 1942 have seen the co-existence of three generations at the time of writing in 2012 - those who experienced the war and occupation, those who were born shortly thereafter with no lived memory of the period, and those for whom 1942 may seem a distant history lesson.
For the generation who lived through the war and occupation, 1942 was a critical year that had in many ways shaped their outlook on life. The effects of war and occupation had a direct or experiential impact on this generation. The memories are deeper, prolonged, and in many cases, traumatic and unhealed. These unhealed memories in their private silence remind us of a harsh legacy of the war and occupation.
While time progresses and commemorative anniversaries come and go, in remembering the past, there is a process of interpretation and re-interpretation in accordance with our present ideas of what is important and what is not4. The door thus remains open for subsequent generations to explore and engage with, and hopefully find relevance in the collective memory of the war and occupation. How the latter will be viewed years from now depends to a large extent on how the distant past can be integrated into the personal memory of maturing or aging individuals who would be experiencing Singapore in its later years of independence. This interaction may well turn out to be a more nuanced and effective way of reclaiming and understanding the past. The narrative role of personal memory becomes important in this sense as a bridge to deal with or cope with the contingent and complex nature of individual experiences whether in war time or in other periods of historical transformations. How the young of 1942 fared individually can hopefully be an empathetic entry point for today's young generation, given hindsight, to reflect upon, interpret and come to terms with, complementing their personal memory of school lessons on wartime history, learning journeys, and Total Defence Day activities.
In the meantime, the present memorial sites, traces and remains of 1942, together with occasional news reports of war relics still being uncovered, are reminders that the â€œlong shadow of 1942â€ is far from disappearing completely and that the past while fleeting, still remains with us.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2014
1923 was a significant year for Singapore. It was the year the Singapore-Johor Causeway was completed, the year broadcasting started in the Republic, and the year the country's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was born.
It was also the year No. 5 Chatsworth Park was built, alongside many other buildings, during a construction boom that followed the end of World War I. This elegant two-storey Art Deco bungalow in the Tanglin area was designed by Frank Brewer, an English architect whose works have significantly shaped Singapore's built landscape.
Although Brewer hailed from the cooler climes of England, he demonstrated a sympathetic appreciation of the challenges of hot and humid tropical living. No. 5 Chatsworth Park incorporated large overhanging roof caves, oriole casement windows, and timber louvres - thoughtful elements that helped to maximize natural ventilation and were critical in providing much-needed thermal respite in the absence of modern-day air-conditioning.
Brewer also incorporated many of is signature touches into the property's design, such as exposed brick pillars, flared eaves and buttressed walls, as well as popular features of the Art Deco style prevalent in the 1920s and 1930s. These include rough-cast plaster rendering, unglazed natural clay roof tiles, grid ceilings and latticed transom with glazed panels.
Surrounded by lush tropical greenery, the bungalow, like others in its vicinity, provided a comfortable home away from home for top Straits officials based in colonial Singapore.
Timeless Desigh
Many decades on, much has changed. The British colonists, as well as Brewer himself, have long left Singapore. No longer a backwater colonial outpost, Singapore itself has transformed into a gleaming, efficient, modern city-state.
While No. 5 Chatsworth Park still stands at its original location, it too has undergone considerable adjustments. The biggest of these - literally - is the addition of a new extension three times the size of the original house in order for the property to accommodate a multigenerational family.
But in a tribute to Brewer's timeless design, many of the early features of the bungalow have been preserved. The project's architects, Eco-id Architects, took special care to retain and restore distinctive features including the casement windows, the lattice and louvred timber windows, the overhanging eaves and clay roof tiles. They also cleverly reused bricks that were recovered from a former outhouse - which was demolished to make way for the new wing - to patch up parts of the crumbling brick pillars.
Within the bungalow, the architects repositioned the timber staircase in order to accentuate the soaring, double-volume space at the entrance foyer. The new staircase was designed with simple, clean lines that fit seamlessly with the rest of the Art Deco elements in the bungalow.
In creating the new extension, the architects also wanted to ensure that the original bungalow remained the star of the show and that the extension, though larger, would complement the principal building without overshadowing it. To achieve this, the architects decided to keep the new building light, modern and discreet - a refreshing contra to the robust, masculine quality of the bungalow. With its neutral grey faÃ§ade and steel finishes, the new wing provides a quiet counterpoint to the bungalow's resplendent solid wood doors and warm brick. 
The architects also borrowed detailing such as the overhanging roof eaves and horizontal louvred timber windows from the original bungalow, and incorporated these into the new wing. Doing so ensured that the old and new parts are knit together by a coherent design language.
A linkway provides a physical connection between the two parts of the development, allowing seamless passage from the old building to the new. The sense of singularity is enhanced by the meandering green landscape that wraps around both buildings, lending a charming ""home on a hillock"" feel to the whole property.
Introducing Frank Brewer
Frank Wilhim Brewer was an English architect who worked in Singapore between 1921 to 1939. From 1922 to 1932, Brewer practiced at Singapore's oldest architectural firm, Swan & Maclaren. During his time in the Lion City, Brewer designed many iconic buildings that have since become major historical landmarks. These include the Flagstaff House at 17 Kheam Hock Road, which is today known as the Command House. The Flagstaff House was the official residence of the British General Officer Commanding of Malaya and other military officials, and functioned as the Combined Operations Headquarters of the British Army and Air Force during World War II. The building was gazette as a national monument in 2009.
Another architectural icon by Brewer is the 16-storey Cathay Building, once Singapore's tallest building. During World War II, the property was converted to a Red Cross Casualty Station, and was later used to house various Japanese military departments. After the war, it served as the headquarters for Admiral Lord Mountbatten. Today, the art-deco style faÃ§ade of the building has been gazette for preservation while the rest of the building has been redeveloped.
About Chatsworth Park and Tanglin
Chatsworth Park is a conservation area, as well as a Good Class Bungalow Area, that consists of 27 conserved bungalows. While these houses were built in the 1920s and 1930s after the end of World War I, many were designed in the ""black and white"" style that characterised prewar architecture. Others followed an Art Deco style. Prominent British and American films like the Straits Trading Company, Cable & Wireless, and the Fire one Rubber Company owned many of these houses in the Chatsworth Park and used them to house their expatriate staff.
Chatsworth Park forms part of the greater Tanglin area, known today for its luxurious residences and five-star hotels, as well as the embassies, consulates and High Commissions of various countries. From the 17th century to the 19th century, Tanglin was full of large gambier, nutmeg and pepper plantations. It was popular among Europeans and Teochews, who established residences and plantations there.
The name Tanglin comes from the Chinese dialect word Tang Leng, which means ""east hill peaks"". This name alludes to the area's location east of Singapore's Chinatown, as well as its hilly nature. Within Tanglin, roads like Ardmore, Dalvey and Chatsworth were named after estates of their early European owners, and still conjure up images today of verdant English countryside.
Art Deco: A Movement of Change and Modernity
The Art Deco phase took off after World War I, together with the Jazz Age. It marked an era of change, hope and energy, as people clamoured for new art and new ideas for the devastating war. The Art Deco movement, which influenced architecture, interior design, fashion and jewellery, responded to this thirst by creating a streamlined and modern yet luxurious approach to design.
Famous Art Deco buildings around the world include New York City's Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. These are characterised by clean lines and futuristic forms, bring to mind modern inventions such as planes, ships and cars, as well as geometric design flourishes like stepped ziggurats, chevrons and sunburst motifs.
In Singapore, notable Art Deco buildings include Clifford Pier, Capitol Theatre, Cathay Theatre and old SIT flats in Tiong Bahru.
ACCOLADES
The respectful and sensitive treatment of the original colonial bungalow has been recognised by Singapore's architectural community. In 2013, the building was awarded the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Architectural Heritage Award, which honours owners, architects, engineers and contractors who took special care to restore buildings for modern use.
When presenting the award, the jury praised the team for giving the property ""a new lease of life with a substantial new wing that is impressive, yet plays up the grandeur of the original"".
Indeed, while No. 5 Chatsworth Park today has changed significantly from its colonial self, its visitors are still treated to a rich slice of Singapore history whenever they step through the building's grand brick entrance.

The National Day Parade (NDP) is an annual celebration of Singapore's independence. It is also a platform for Singaporeans from all walks of life to come together to celebrate the nation's milestones and achievements while rallying ourselves in preparation for the future. This article traces the many first and highlights of NDPs over the 50 years to 2016.
Singapore's first NDP was held in 1966, a year after being separated from Malaysia.

In the 1960s, all the parades were held at the Padang, which is one of the reasons that the Padang is still an iconic historical landmark in Singapore. The military displays and marching parades drew spectators young and old, regardless of the weather. This speaks of the nation's strength, progress and unity.

The 1970s was a decade that saw a surge in industrial development and technological advancement. This was evident in the NDP celebrations as Singapore had her first state flag flypast in 1970.

In 1974, the parade was broadcast in colour for the first time. In 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1983, NDP celebrations were decentralized and were more informal and casual. This allowed more people to catch the performances and parades on-site. In the 1980s, National Day songs made their debut with songs such as Stand up for Singapore (1984). Separately, Singapore's impressive military displays grew continually and advanced technologically. Since 1986, parade spectators have enjoyed atmospheric effects created through laser beams, lights and projections.

As Singaporeans came together in 1990 to sing One People, One Nation, One Singapore in celebration of Singapore's 25th birthday at The Padang, they also saw, for the first time, a sea review of our defence on water. NDPs in the 1990s were filled with much spectacle. Particularly memorable was the 1994 NDP ""night parade"" that started later than usual at 7.15pm.

NDPs in the 2000s were vastly different from the ones before, reflecting the changes and progress the young nation had made. In NDP 2002, there was a grand toast to Singapore's NEWater. The shift from the National Stadium to the Float@Marina Bay in 2007 was also a key event for Singapore. That year, Singapore saw the first ever NDP on water with Singapore's skyline providing the backdrop.

NDP 2015, however, was the grandest NDP to date, with the nation celebrating its 50th birthday. Year-long celebrations marked the golden jubilee, which was termed SG50.

The 50 years leading up to 2016 for Singapore have been a swift march of growth and confidence, with these changes reflected in the choreography of our parades. National Day is not just a day for Singaporeans to celebrate their nation's birthday, it is also a day when Singaporeans set aside everything to celebrate their achievements, and look back with pride at the nation's growth from year to year, recalling key national moments that will stay in their hearts and minds.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/sentosa/story,"TL;DR
Few today would associate the tranquil getaway of Sentosa with death but that was the case for centuries when it was known as Pulau Blakang Mati or â€œthe island behind which lies deathâ€. A competition in 1969 to rename the 500ha island was part of a grand plan to transform it into a tourist destination as well as an enclave for the super rich. Here's how it happened.

Pirates, villages and forts
Located off the southern coast of Singapore, the 500-hectare island we know as Sentosa today, used to be called Pulau Blakang Mati from as far back as the 1600s.1 Its name translates to â€œthe island behind which lies deathâ€, possibly a result of brutal pirate battles of yesteryear.2

During the colonial era, a mysterious epidemic wiped out staff working at a British signal station.3 British doctor Robert Little who attended to the ill on the island in 1848, documented the existence of three villages inhabited by Malays, Bugis and Chinese.4They were: Kampong Ayer Bandera, Kampong Serapong and Kampong Blakan Mati. The doctor added that the island was home to various plantations among which pineapple was the most prevalent. Blakang Mati, he added, was ""one vast pinery, supplying the island of Singapore with this delightful and refreshing fruit"".
The island by and large served as a military base during the colonial era. To guard the eastern and western entrances of the harbour, Forts Serapong, Connaught and Siloso, as well as the Mount Imbiah Battery were installed in the 1870s and 1880s. In the 1930s, the British added guns with the ability to pierce through armoured ships. Royal Artillery units also moved in.

British personnel on Blakang Mati were served by dhobis (Indian laundry workers) and Chinese cooks. For leisure, they boarded sampans for the mainland where they could pay for a dance with a cabaret hostess at one of Singapore's three amusement parks, or enjoy a steak at one of the cafes around Victoria Street.7

A dark episode
Contrary to popular belief, the military installations on Blakang Mati were not completely useless in the Battle of Singapore for they were used to fire on targets in the centre, west and north of Singapore. In fact, the Japanese perceived the fortifications as a threat which explains the air raid of 18 January 1942 when 100 bombs were dropped on Blakang Mati.8
Shortly after the invasion, the Japanese rounded up Chinese men and had them executed in remote locations around Singapore. In 1957, eight skulls and almost 100 bones were found in one of Blakang Mati's creeks â€” likely the remains of Chinese men who had worked at the Singapore Harbour Board.9
During the occupation, Blakang Mati housed a prisoner of war camp for about 1,000 allied troops. One prisoner, Sergeant Thomas A. Dineen, was a radio hobbyist who cobbled together a radio receiving set from odds and ends like silver paper and wire. He discreetly disseminated news of Allied victories elsewhere in the world to keep morale up among fellow prisoners.10

After the war, various British military units, as well as the Gurkhas, reoccupied Blakang Mati.
The civilian population also grew in numbers, as did economic activity on the island in the form of shops and services. Schools and religious institutions sprung up as well.11
Mainland visitors were drawn to Blakang Mati. Some brought with them fishing rods for a day out in the sun, others spent the night there, camping along its coast and making friends with villagers.12
â€œBattleâ€ for the island
In 1967, Blakang Mati was officially parked under the jurisdiction of the newly independent government of Singapore13 which was understandably excited about its potential. The ministry of defence wanted to place security guns there, while other agencies envisioned a petrochemical complex or oil-related industrial hub. A few suggested it take on new life as a tourist resort.14
The plan to start an oil refinery was given legs when the government reached an agreement with energy corporation Esso. However, Albert Winsemius, an economic advisor to the government, as well as Alan Choe who was at the helm of Singapore's Urban Renewal Unit (now the Urban Redevelopment Authority), convinced Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew that it was better to turn the island into a resort for recreation and tourism.
The potential air pollution from having an oil refinery so close to the city centre might have pushed the authorities to ultimately choose to retain Blakang Mati as a holiday island cum green lung.15 The deal with Esso was renegotiated and the refinery was eventually built in Jurong, further from the heart of the city.
A suggestion to turn Blakang Mati into an industrial complex with deep water berths was also shelved following a study which found heavy shipping traffic along the island's coasts too challenging to work around.16 Other sites which had been vacated by British forces, were allocated for such purposes instead.17
Building paradise
In January 1969, the chairman of the Tourist Promotion Board of Singapore, P. H. Meadows outlined plans to build a dreamy â€œsouth sea island paradiseâ€ with chalet-like hotels as well as golf courses and parklands. There too would be the option for scuba-diving and horse-riding. The goal, he shared, was to ""attract millions of sunseeking tourists from all over the worldâ€.18
To this end, the Tourist Promotion Board launched a naming contest to rebrand the site.19 The isle of tranquillity, or Sentosa in Malay, was eventually selected â€” a stark contrast to the ominous sounding Blakang Mati.
By 1972, $124 million worth of state money and private sector investment had been set aside for the resort's development. Sentosa Development Corporation was established the same year to oversee the massive undertaking.
To connect visitors from mainland Singapore (via Mount Faber) to Sentosa, a cable car system was rolled out in 1974. It was well-received, with 50,000 passengers taking it monthly for almost a year. To cope with demand, more cars were added.
In its early years, visitors could only access Sentosa by ferry or cable car. This changed when a monorail was completed in 1982. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Soon after, attractions such as the Sentosa Golf Club, Sentosa Coralarium, the Palawan Beach Lagoon, a musical fountain, and Fort Siloso which was repurposed into an educational pitstop, were completed. Later, a butterfly park, and the Surrender Chambers which housed waxwork exhibits detailing Singapore's WWII story, opened to the public.

Visitorship hit a million during the financial year of 1979/1980.
Not all was smooth sailing. In 1983, a drillship crashed into the Sentosa cableway, knocking off two cars which plunged 55 metres into the sea. Seven passengers died.20
After the incident, the Sentosa Development Corporation put in place measures to better ensure visitor safety.21

Keeping it fresh
Over the years, the Sentosa Development Corporation has had to refresh its offerings to satiate changing appetites and generate ongoing interest.
Infrastructural improvements, facelifts to existing destinations, as well as the addition of new hotels and attractions such as Underwater World Singapore, and an $8 million, 12-storey high sculpture of the Merlion marked the 1990s.
In the 2000s, the island began hosting popular beach dance parties. Sentosa Cove, a residential enclave for the ultra wealthy, was launched in 2003.
In 2010, Resorts World Sentosa comprising the Universal Studios theme park, as well as the Republic's first casino, opened its doors.
As of 2022 â€” Sentosa's 50th anniversary â€” plans are afoot to update and expand the paradise island yet again.22

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/badang-the-magnificent/story,"This story first appeared in National Heritage Board's book, titled, 'Attack Of The Swordfish And Other Singapore Tales' by Charlotte Lim (Text) and Alicia Tan Yen Ping (Illustration). This book consists of six illustrated tales for early Primary school children that are based on Singapore legends or traditions.
There was once a slave named Badang who lived in a place called Saluang. He hated the sweat and toil of working on his master's lands. ""I wish I could be strong! Then the work would not be so hard!"" Badang would moan.
There were days too when the hopeful slave longed to be free from bondage. Free to go out fishing. It was the one thing he looked forward to doing whenever he had the chance to slip out of the farm.
Under night's secret veil, while the frogs croaked and the owls gawked, he would lay traps along the sea bed to catch fish. Whenever he could sneak out again, he would return to claim his catch and cook it over a fire.
However, one day, Badang discovered only fish bones in his net. He looked around but no one or nothing was in sight. Hungry and disappointed, he decided to lay a trap to catch the culprit.
After placing a freshly caught fish in the net, Badang hid behind some tall grass and waited patiently. He was about to doze off when a rustling sound startled him. To his horror, a hideous creature with fiery red eyes trudged out of the cold damp woods. It began foaming at the mouth as it greedily approached the net.
The lumbering monster had horns on its dreadful head and tusks that stuck out from its upper jaw. It was taller than any man Badang had ever seen. Its grimy beard reached its waist and was as tangled as its long, unkempt hair.
Badang was about to take off but when he saw the creature wolfing down the fish he had caught, he got very mad! He pounced on it with his parang.
""How dare you steal my fish?"" shouted Badang, as he grabbed the monster by its beard and held the parang to its throat.
""I'll kill you for this!""
The monster almost choked on the fish. It fell on its knees, begging Badang for mercy. It wailed, ""Please don't kill me, kind sir! I'll repay your kindness by granting you anything you ask for! Please let me go!""
Badang looked the monster in the eye and realised it was telling the truth. Perhaps this was his chance to ask for supernatural strength. Badang said, ""I want to be the strongest man on earth! Do it or you will die this instant!""
The monster nodded. ""I will make you the strongest man alive but first, you have to do something.""
""What do I have to do?"" Badang asked.
""You have to eat my vomit,"" disclosed the monster. ""Only then will you gain great strength!""
The thought of having to swallow vomit made Badang sick in the stomach but he desperately wanted the power.
When he had fulfilled his task, the monster asked earnestly, ""Now will you let me go?""
Badang was a man of honour, so he set the beast free and warned it never to take what did not belong to it.
Back on the farm, Badang eagerly made use of his newfound strength. The other slaves and his master were amazed. Soon, news about his mighty power spread across the kingdom and neighbouring lands.
It was not long before the King of Singapore, Sri Rama Wira Kerma, heard about Badang and summoned him to his court.
""I hear that you have great strength,"" said the King when Badang was brought before him.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" said Badang, bowing respectfully.
""I have a 45-foot boat which has just been completed. It would take at least one thousand men to push it into the sea. Can you do it on your own?"" asked the King.
""I will try, Your Majesty,"" said Badang. With just one amazing touch of his hand, he pushed the boat into the water as if it were a toy.
The King was delighted. ""From this day forth, you shall no longer be a slave,"" he said, ""and you shall be the new commander of my army.""
When the ruler of Kalinga in India heard about Badang, he wanted to test his strength.
""I will reward you with seven ships of goods if you can beat my strong man in a series of contests, Badang,â€ the Ruler said. The strong man from Kalinga, not wanting to admit defeat, challenged Badang to a final duel.
""Let's see who can throw that stone the furthest,"" he said, pointing to the large smooth rock on the top of a hill.
Badang agreed. The Kalinga strong man huffed and puffed. He could only lift the stone up to his knees. Badang, however, picked it up like it was a rubber seed and flung it so far away that it landed at the mouth of the Singapore River.
Soon, stories of Badang's courage and victories were told in every corner of the land. He became the champion of the people. Everywhere he went, he was greeted by cheers and tributes, especially among slaves.
Legend has it that Badang served the King well until his last day and Singapore enjoyed many years of peace and security.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Geylang-Serai-Ku/story,"Located at junction of Onan Road and Geylang Road, Garrick Cinema was once a popular cinema   that served the residents of Joo Chiat.
Former Joo Chiat Road resident Mr Chan Thai Ho spent his entire childhood in Joo Chiat Road, during which he would watch films at Garrick Cinema.
Today, the former Garrick cinema houses the Muslim Converts' Association of Singapore. Photo courtesy of MCAS.
â€œI remember watching the film Pontianak with all the other kampong boys,â€ said Mr Chan.
â€œBack in those days, tickets cost less than a bowl of mee. So you either get some form of entertainment or you go about satisfying your belly,â€ he continued.
Mr Chan also commented that ticket prices would increase as you go further up the rows â€“ the back rows offer a better view. 
For instance, the middle wing and the back row would be priced at 50 cents and a dollar a seat respectively, as opposed to paying just 30 cents for the front few seats.
The area around the cinema became a playground for Mr Chan and his friends, before he pursued his cadetship with the Singapore Fire Brigade.
Mr Chan's cousin Mrs Wee Gek Suan was also a former Joo Chiat Road resident.
For Mrs Wee, talking about the Garrick Cinema brings back fond memories of her childhood playing on the grounds of what was once a Dutch Camp that housed a Dutch community following the Japanese surrender in 1945.
The camp stretched from Geylang Serai all the way to Crane Road.
â€œI would spend my afternoons helping my mom and my aunt sell gado-gado beneath a shady tree in the Dutch Camp,â€ she began.
â€œThe Dutch troops were very friendly towards us and I remember receiving sweets from them,â€ she continued.
According to Mrs Wee, the Dutch loved gado-gado so much so that every bowl would be sold before the end of the day.
â€œIt was a very pleasant community surrounded by a beautiful setting of luscious greenery and little semi-detached houses.â€
Garrick Cinema was renamed Galaxy Theatre in 1965, and is still known as â€˜The Galaxy' to the elder folk. Today, The Galaxy houses Muslim Converts' Association of Singapore (MCAS), or Darul Arqam â€“ as commonly referred to by the younger generation.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 3 - Jan 2017
One gets a sense of both the local and the colonial when exploring Bukit Timah. From road names such as Princess of Wales Road and Jalan Haji Alias, to buildings like St Joseph's Church, the former Ford Motor Factory and The Chinese High School, centuries of history can be found in Bukit Timah, each telling a part of Singapore's past.
Remnants of Singapore's colonial era can be found in the very road that traverses Bukit Timah today. In the early years after Sir Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a British trading port in 1819, the country's interior was still relatively unexplored by the Europeans. Even though there were signs in the 1820s that indicated the presence of local settlers inland, the land beyond the Singapore River, such as Bukit Timah, was still deemed â€œwild and lawlessâ€ and these early inhabitants as â€œstraying from the fold of civilisationâ€, quoting Sir James Brooke a naval officer stationed in Singapore in 1839.
Brooke's evident bias reflected the colonial thinking of the time. Without access into the interior, it was impossible for the British to establish control over the land. As such, a long road weaving into Bukit Timah was constructed from the 1830s to 1840s, an attempt by the British authorities to impose some degree of colonial regulation over the unsurveyed interior. Part of this road is known contemporarily as Bukit Timah Road and Upper Bukit Timah Road. Completed in 1845, the road connected the northern tip of Singapore from Kranji to the heart of the city in the south, serving also as the main artery leading to neighbouring Johor.
The road's establishment precipitated a greater flow of people and commodities into the interior of Singapore. About half a century later in 1900, a railway line was being built to facilitate this movement. This railway line was later known as the Singapore-Johor Railway, and has become a shared memory among the subsequent generations of Singaporeans who remembered travelling to Malaysia via this railway.

As the interior opened, missionaries also ventured inwards to evangelise. French Missionary Fr Anatole Mauduit MEP purchased a parcel of land from the British East India Company to set up St Joseph's Church between 1852 and 1853 at the 9 1â„2 milestone along Upper Bukit Timah Road. Like many of the early Christian churches that owned tracts of land, the church parcelled out its land to parishioners to live and work. Over time, a network of institutions were built around St Joseph's Church, including a trade school that would become Boys' Town Singapore, serving the local community at Bukit Timah.
Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is arguably the most prominent landmark in the area. Standing at 163 metres high, the reserve is a sanctuary for many who seek reprieve from the hustle of the urban city today. The establishment of the reserve began in the 1840s, when the colonial authorities first made the hill a reserve. The area was recognised for its thriving ecology, with naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace extolling about the rich biodiversity found there after visiting Singapore in the 1850s. Wallace described the reserve in his book, The Malay Archipelago, saying, â€œ[in] all my subsequent travels in the East I rarely if ever met with so productive a spot.â€ His observations in Bukit Timah also contributed to his eventual thesis on natural selection, conceived independently from Charles Darwin who also arrived at the same theory.

However, despite initial colonial efforts to prevent illegal timber harvesting and preserve the rainforest, poor management over the years depleted the hill's primary forests. The granite quarries of the 1900s that are today incorporated into the reserve's trails had further threatened the hill's fragile ecology. Portions of the primary rainforest remaining today were saved in the 1930s by the efforts of Richard Eric Holttum, the director of the Botanic Gardens and his staff, including assistant director E. J. H. Corner and his assistant Mohammad Noor, who tried to lure away illegal woodcutters and throw their logging equipment away when they were distracted.

The serenity of the reserve today betrays the darker side of its history during the Second World War. The hill's elevation made Bukit Timah an important target for the Japanese during the Second World War, providing a tactical vantage point that the invading troops wanted. Moreover, vital British supply dumps were stored in the area. At midnight of 10 February 1942, Japanese troops marched into Bukit Timah Village and by the following day, Bukit Timah hill fell into Japanese hands.

Another prominent site in Bukit Timah also featured significantly during the war. The former Ford Motor Factory along Upper Bukit Timah Road was converted into Lieutenant General Yamashita's forward headquarters. It was at the factory where the terms of British surrender were discussed on February 15, 1942, a date that is still sombrely commemorated annually.

As the 1950s arrived, stirrings of early nationalism began to take hold in Singapore. Bukit Timah bore witness to this period of political awakening during the tumultuous decades of the 1950s and 1960s. Students from The Chinese High School were at the frontlines of several anti-colonial disputes, including the May 13, 1954 student protest over national conscription, which then saw about 2,000 Chinese High and Chung Cheng High School students staging a 22-day hunger strike against police violence in the following days. Students from the nearby University of Malaya (today's National University of Singapore Bukit Timah Campus) also formed societies such as the University Socialist Club and Democratic Club to agitate for social and political causes during this period.
While these heritage sites reflect the more eventful moments in Singapore history, other places in Bukit Timah are remembered for being well-loved community spaces. Unsurprisingly, several of these spaces revolve around food, which is an unspoken shared pastime for Singaporeans. Some of these places draw Singaporeans from other parts of the island to Bukit Timah. The Adam Food Centre, for example, is one such popular food haunt. It started as a group of open-air stalls before moving to its current location opposite Serene Centre in 1974. Some of the stalls today, such as Bahrakath Mutton Soup King (stall No. 10) and Sathiyame Jeyam (stall No. 13), have been around since the early 1970s.

The rows of shophouses at Cheong Chin Nam Road and Chun Tin Road also offer a plethora of food choices. The latter street was named after Cheong Chun Tin, the first qualified dentist of Chinese descent in Singapore, whose son Chin Nam owned a rubber estate in the area. These roads grew popular from the 1990s, becoming well-known for restaurants that served halal Malay, Indian and Chinese dishes. Today, Korean and Chinese eateries can also be found there, offering even greater variety to the bustling lunch and dinner crowd.
Especially for the older generation, it is also not possible to speak of Bukit Timah without referring to the once-famous Beauty World, which started out as an amusement park during the Japanese Occupation and later converted into a marketplace in 1947. Unfortunately, Beauty World was destroyed by two large fires in 1975 and 1977, and subsequently redeveloped. Today, the Beauty World name is carried on by the shopping malls Beauty World Centre and Beauty World Plaza, both built in the 1980s and located across the road of the original market.
It is hard not to notice the number of schools that line the stretch of Bukit Timah Road. Bukit Timah is home to The Chinese High School, Nanyang Girls' High School, Methodist Girls' School, National Junior College and Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary, to name a few. Pei Hwa Presbyterian is one of the oldest schools in Bukit Timah, founded by the Chinese Christian Church (now Glory Presbyterian Church) in 1889.

For many of these students who went to school in the area in the 1990s, the former McDonald's Place at King Albert Park would have been one of the choice places in Bukit Timah to hang out after class. The spacious two-storey branch opened in 1991 as the biggest McDonald's outlet in Singapore, and also housed the restaurant's corporate headquarters and a staff training centre. Students and residents alike have incorporated their visits to the restaurant as part of their daily routine. â€œWe would have lunch, read books, study and enjoy the air-con,â€ David Lim, a former Nan Hua Secondary alumnus remembers. Some students would park themselves on one of the 433 seats daily to study during the examination period. It is also very common for residents to visit the outlet for breakfast on Saturday mornings. Although the outlet closed in 2014, these memories live on among the generations of students who studied in Bukit Timah.

Bukit Timah is one of the areas that witnessed the Japanese invasion during World War II, and was also where the British surrendered on 15 February 1942, marking the start of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. These sites of World War II are featured in the Bukit Timah Heritage Trail, one of the 17 trails offered by the National Heritage Board as of 2016. The trails can be downloaded at the NHB portal here.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/East-Coast-Lagoon-Food-Village,"The East Coast Lagoon Food Village was built over land which was reclaimed from the sea. The reclamation that created the East Coast Lagoon was started in the 1960s. It was not until 1971 that the construction of the first housing blocks in the area began, and with this, the development of the beach front also commenced. The laying out of the lagoon (1972-76) also included provision for hawker stalls. It was in 1977, after the completion of the lagoon, that the concept of the hawker centre and its site was finally confirmed.
The construction of the new hawker centre started in April 1977. This single-level timbered structured eatery was designed in such a way that it blended in with the environment of the seaside and swimming lagoon. The cooking area was composed of 10 structures which had butterfly-shaped roofs while the eating areas had 40 pyramid-shaped top shelters.  It was completed in late 1978 at a cost of $685,000. The eating areas were â€œarranged in a series of courtyards to create interesting spaces and to act as covered links from one stall to anotherâ€. To give customers a better view of the lagoon, â€œthe floor of the entire centre is raisedâ€.
Most of the initial cooked food hawkers in this newly built hawker centre were relocated from Alkaff Lane, near the junction of McPherson Road and Serangoon Road.
However, the new food centre encountered challenging times soon after it opened for business. Despite having been Singapore's only seaside hawker centre, it experienced relatively poor sales in the 1980s. It was towards the end of 1990s that the stalls in the food centre became â€œwell-known among foodies island-wideâ€.  By this time, it also became a popular and choice weekend destination for those in search of their favourite food.
In 1981, following the norms of the day, the hawker centre was refashioned as the East Coast Lagoon Food Centre. Following this, it underwent several major upgrading exercises in 1988, 1992 and 2002. It was after the 1992 renovation that the food centre was renamed East Coast Lagoon Food Rendezvous.
During the 2002-2004 revamp, which cost $4.5 million, the structure of the new food centre was transformed to reflected Balinese-style architecture to look resort-like. This round of renovation was had been part the Government's Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme. It seems that all 61 hawkers had opted to return when the works was completed, although they were given the option of accepting $23,000 for leaving. It was Mr Daniel Wang, Commissioner of Public Health (1981-2003), Director General of Public Health (2004), who told the architect to make full use of its unique location next to the beach, so that even people in swimming costumes could walk into the hawker centre to eat. When it officially reopened after the renovation in January 2004 it was renamed as the East Coast Lagoon Food Village.
In June 2013, four food stalls caught fire. Although only certain stalls had been damaged, the NEA, which had already planned for the centre to undergo an upgrading, took the opportunity the fire presented to close the hawker centre for 3 months for its upgrading programme that cost $1.5 million. It was during this upgrade that new roofing and timber flooring on walkways were also installed.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Adam-Road-Food-Centre,"The Adam Road Hawker Centre, opened in 1974, was one of the series of dedicated food centres created in the 1970s. As part of the government's wider effort to remove hawkers from the streets, it was built independent of a wet market. The hawker centre had its roots in an earlier market started in 1971 when the Public Works Department laid the ground for temporary food stalls next to Bukit Timah Canal. This was opposite the present food centre. This first establishment was actually a series of temporary sheds that housed 32 stalls.

In 1973, when the government announced plans to build a highway across Bukit Timah Road to link Adam Road to Farrer Road, which affected the centre, plans were then made to shift it across the road to its present site. The new hawker centre was officially opened by the then Minister for Law and National Development, E W Barker on 28 September 1974. It had 32 cooked food stalls, as it had in the old centre. Most of the hawkers who started at this new centre were from the first batch of vendors who were â€œoriginally stationed at the junction of Farrer Road and Adam Road where conditions were not healthyâ€, having been next to a canal.
The design of the first centre was a basic U-shaped layout that was linked at the front by a covered walkway. The middle of the centre was an open space with the round tables with four round seats were permanently mounted on tile floors. The stalls were overlaid by mosaic tiles and had steel frames and bars that held up a zinc corrugated roof over the stalls.
Soon after opening, the Adam Road Hawker Centre had already been famed as a place for great Malay food. It was known to provide cheap and â€œvery tastyâ€ food. It is still particularly famed for its nasi lemak and mutton soup. In 2016, Adam Road Food Centre stall serves 1,000 plates of nasi lemak daily.
Besides good eats, Adam Road Food Centre has also been a favourite visit by many across the years. In the 1980s, Adam Road Food Centre was the designated hawker centre for police personnel lunch breaks. They would take lunch there after their tour of duty before returning to the station. It was also frequently patronised by students studying nearby (University), chauffeurs and the residents nearby.
However, having been built so close to the Bukit Timah Canal, the centre was constantly flooded in the 1980s when it rained heavily. Quite often, customers were stranded in the hawker centre during times of serious flooding. Adam Road Food Centre underwent major repairs and redecoration in 1997.
In 2001, the food centre was closed for 5 months for another round of renovation, and reopened in mid-May 2002. The upgrading works cost $1.73 million and was the first Environment Ministry hawker centre to be completed under its upgrading programme. The upgraded centre had a higher roof in the same shape as the old one to improve ventilation, new tiles and the rules floor was raised to prevent flooding and a courtyard with umbrella-covered tables and chairs. All the food stallholders chose to stay after the upgrading ad been completed. The refreshed centre, including the outdoor seats and rectangular tables, could accommodate about 410 persons, up from 345 prior to this exercise. The five old angsana trees located outside the centre were preserved as part of the government special effort retain the uniqueness of the eatery.  These trees give shade, limited shelter from rain and sun, and also serve as a muffler for traffic noises.
Other unique characteristics of the food centre, such as the nine-sided, almost circular, shape of the building and the central outdoor dining courtyard, were retained to maintain the sense of familiarity to the centre.
The sense of belonging of the old stallholders had been so strong that all of them chose to remain in the newly revamped centre although they were all offered alternative sites during the renovation.
Over the years, great effort has been taken to keep the Adam Road Food Centre a clean and conducive place to dine. It underwent further updating and face-lifts in 2008 and 2016.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Geylang-Serai-Market-Food-Centre,"The present Geylang Serai Market & Food Centre espouses the heritage of a number of markets in the Geylang Serai area that goes back to the pre-World War II days. There was a make shift hawker shelter at the entrance of Kampong Geylang Serai, opposite Joo Chiat Road, which the municipality erected some time before 1930. The locals called it Geylang Serai Market. Although it was closed soon after 1930, hawkers continued to ply there and the â€œmarket placeâ€ continued. When the Japanese Occupation started, the grounds of this market space was turned into an amusement park. After the war, the makeshift street hawker-market area made a comeback. By the early 1950s, the residents of the nearby Kampong Melayu started to visit this â€œMalayâ€ market frequently for their marketing needs as they had no market of their own at Jalan Eunos.

From 1952, the government turned the area into a â€œChangi Trade Fairâ€, which was intended to be Singapore's largest trade and industrial fairground. Upon completion, it was christened the Great Eastern Trade Fair. However, it started faltering from 1954. The site owners opened the New City Cinema within its grounds in October 1957 in the hope of bring new life to the site. It nevertheless closed a year later. Interestingly, it was not because the area was not well patronised. The fact of the matter was that the Malays of the district preferred to visit market stalls around Great Eastern Park.
The great leap forward came in 1962 when the government announced the start of the Geylang Serai Development Scheme which was the first step in the urban development of the district, and this included the building of a proper market on the site of now defunct Great Eastern Park.
PM Lee Kuan Yew himself laid the foundation stone of the new market in August 1963. When this covered market was completed in 1964, the estate had a simple wet market under a zinc roof. The locals called it Pasar Geylang Serai.
Even before the completion of the market, the Geylang Serai was already a Malay cultural heartland, where the street hawkers had formed a â€œpermanent bazaarâ€ where many Malays would visit every festive occasion. Naturally, the Malay Stallholders Association of Geylang asked the government for a piece of ground next to the market to set up a Malay bazaar.
The opening of the market, unfortunately, coincided with the 1964 racial riots. As a result, many of the street hawkers who were supposed to have moved into the new Geylang Serai Market decided to give it a miss for fear that they may be attacked. So, Geylang Serai Market became a white elephant for some years, while the street hawkers continued to operate all along the streets around.
Over time, most of the market stalls were eventually occupied. In 1975, almost a decade after opening, Geylang Serai Market underwent its first upgrade. At this point, the market had three sections: the Eating House, which was considered the place where Singapore's largest variety of Muslim food could be found, the Market proper (wet market) and the textile and sundry goods area, where many of the stalls were owned by Malays or Indian Muslims.
In 1978, the stalls in the market doubled when market produce and cooked food stalls from Haig Road Market were shifted there. By this time, the Geylang Serai Market had become the main market in the area as the nearby Changi and Joo Chiat markets had already closed. Its growing popularity had seen it outlive its neighbouring markets. In the early 1980s, the market attracted shoppers during Hari Raya, and not from all parts of Singapore but also from across the Causeway.
The turning point came in 1984 when the government announced plans for the conservation of Geylang Serai's Malay cultural heritage with the development of a Malay cultural village next to Geylang Serai Market. When the construction of the Village commenced in earnest, the market underwent renovation. When the Village faltered, the market was redeveloped independently. In 2006, the market was torn down and rebuilt. It was completed in 2009 and the old stallholders returned. One of the original intent in rebuilding the whole market was to make it more attractive and accessible to tourists.  This $18.2 million market building is shaped like a Malay Kampong house. The completion of the new market in 2011 coincided with the closure of the Malay Village, and this made the Geylang Serai Market one of the bigger draws of the area. Many still visit the market to get their Malay bajus and batiks which could be gotten on the cheap. This double-storey market and hawker centre is unique for its Malay kampong design that retains and exudes its cultural heritage.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Newton-Circus-Food-Centre,"Newton Food Centre was opened in 1971 as Singapore's first hawker centre built without a wet market.  It was part of the government's 1970 initiative to build dedicated food centres along major thoroughfares and traffic intersections.
First christened as the Newton Circus Hawker Centre, it has been erected on a piece of empty ground opposite the traffic circus (Newton Circus) and in proximity of a Malay Girls' School which had been there since the mid-1950s. Situated opposite the centre was also the Anthony Road Girl's School (closed in 1983). These schools and the adjoining Government Quarters in the area, had created a sizable community in the district which became a magnet that attracted street hawkers. As early as the 1950s street hawkers had already gathered at this crossroad to ply their trade in a weekly bazaar. By 1960, it had become so popular that the bazaar was held three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Office workers and housewives in search of good deals frequented the bazaar. By 1966, the Newton Circus street hawkers had turned the district into a pasar malam site. The government found it difficult to relocate all of them to other sites.
At the same time, by 1970, the Newton Circles area had proven to have been a significant intersection into town. The government decided to build a hawker centre on site with its own parking facilities. It was completed at the end of 1970, it was touted as a centre with â€œhawker stalls in a garden setting.â€ The centre, surrounded by large shady trees, was basically composed of seven structures that had colourful nylon roofs. Each structure hosted eight stalls. This garden concept was part of PM Lee Kuan Yew's 1967 vision of a clean and beautiful city. He wanted to turn the island into a garden city â€œwithin three yearsâ€. Accordingly, the government declared that a â€œfloral mileâ€ was to be created from Newton Circus to Clementi Circus, where nurseries would be established to help beautify the island. Hence, the hawker centre was designed with a garden setting that complemented Singapore's â€œgarden cityâ€ image.
Built by the Public Works Department, the centre was the â€œfirst hawker stalls [built] in a garden settingâ€. When completed, it was intended to relocate there 56 hawkers who had been selling food in that part of Bukit Timah Road for years. In early 1977, following its first major renovation to improve its cleanliness, the hawker centre was expanded to allow for additional hawker stalls to accommodate 33 street hawkers from Orchard Road and Marine Parade, and 55 from Joo Chiat and East Coast. By this time, the Hawker Centre had been significantly enlarged.
Newton Circus Hawker Centre had since the 1970s been popular with both tourists and locals for its ambience and great food. In 1978, a stall, specialising in selling oyster omelette, was chosen out of the 88 stalls in Newton Circus hawker centre by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board to run his business at the Rasa Singapura Food Centre at Tanglin.
In 1982, the Environment Ministry found that the Newton Circus food centre was the second most popular eating place in Singapore, just behind Telok Ayer food centre. It had an average of 7,309 patrons daily during peak hours. However, the food centre had also become so â€œfilthyâ€ and deteriorated state that it required renovation. This sprucing up, mainly cosmetic, took place in 1988. In November 1999, the centre underwent another major revamp.
In September 2005, the centre was completely rebuilt. The architects of the new centre took care to create a food centre that was â€œa throwbackâ€ to old times Singapore.â€ The new stalls were arranged in a horseshoe shape, creating a central courtyard dining space. Palms, nutmeg, pepper and other plants have also been planted around the food centre, many of which would have been found in the colonial-era plantations of this area.   The architects took inspiration from a row of old colonial black-and-white terrace houses in Monk's Hill Terrace, next to Newton Circus. The new centre housed the same number of stalls as in the old food centre. There were also more seats with 90 per cent of the seating either sheltered or under umbrellas.
In 2016, Newton Circus Food Centre was upgraded once more.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Chinatown-Complex-Market-Food-Centre,"The Kreta Ayer Complex was built in 1981 as a part of the urban renewal of the Chinatown. It was renamed Chinatown Complex in 1984. Hence, when the market and food centre within the complex was completed in that year, it was named Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre. The complex had been a crucial part of the government's effort to provide a final solution to the thousands of street hawkers who were still plying their trade illegally throughout the streets of Chinatown. As they depended on this trade for their livelihood, it was not a problem the government could solve easily. The establishment of the colossal Chinatown Complex right at the heart of the street hawker district, Smith, Trengganu, Pagoda and Temple Streets, provided the permanent solution.

When the last Chinatown street hawkers moved into the newly completed $18 million complex in October 1983, 300 street hawkers from the surrounding streets were resettled there. This paved the way for the dismantling of all the wooden stalls and shelters that obstructed the roads around, and it was said that, for the first time, the streets were quiet and empty. In reality, the clearance of all the hawkers from the streets allowed the government to thoroughly clean up the district, clearing the drains and eradicating the insects and rodents.
The resettlement of the street hawkers at this time also led to a fear that the government would wipe away years of Chinatown heritage and tradition. The street hawkers had been part of the Chinatown street scene even before World War II, and had become synonymous with the social-cultural identity of the Chinatown district. It was feared that removing the last of them into high-rise food centres and markets would erode the character of what was traditional Chinatown. With this concern in mind, care was given on the architecture of the building, which was designed to blend with the Chinatown streetscape. The new complex is endowed with Chinese elements like pavilions, columns, motifs, arches, clay-tiles, pitch roofs, covered walkways, tall windows and a rooftop garden which was similar to the concept of the courtyard in the old Chinatown buildings.
The market and food centre also has wide thoroughfares on the ground level which provide ample space for mass movement, an important feature during festive times when the place will be overwhelmed. While the food centre is located in the second level, the wet market occupies the basement and the sundry shops are on the ground level. The car park occupies the fourth and fifth levels. The creation of the upper level parking spaces and the basement wet market area had been a crucial part of the design for the complex as it is built in the heart of Singapore's central district where land is scarce and valuable.
The Housing and Development Board would periodically upgrade the food centre and market in the 1990s to improve the facilities there. In 1991, fixed tables and chairs were installed. In 1996, the centre installed a new sanitation system. Then in 2006, the centre was upgraded once more. When it reopened in 2008, the complex had more than 700 stalls. It was the most extensive upgrading project done by NEA then, and it cost $20.9 million. Through the years, the new complex had been home for all the street hawkers who had been the living heritage of the traditional foods and trade of Chinatown. Many of them had remained at the complex for decades. By 2016, there were still about 20% of the original hawkers who could be found at the cooked food zone of the complex.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Maxwell-Road-Food-Centre,"Maxwell Road Food Centre started as wet market in 1929 dealing mainly with fresh produce. Although it was planned for more than a decade earlier, works on the market started only in 1927. The land on which the market was built had once been a Chinese burial ground which was cleared in 1907. It was only in 1925 that the road next to the future market was laid and named Maxwell Road. It was from then that the intended edifice was called Maxwell Road Market. After the construction works of the main structure had been completed in mid-1928, a tender was then called for the installation of the market's stalls. The market opened for business in 1929.

However, most of street hawkers intended to be relocated into the new market chose to remain outside the surrounding streets around the market where they did not have to pay any rental. This made situation difficult for those who had taken stalls within the market as they were unable to make any profit with keen competition from the itinerant street hawkers. By late 1929, the market became a â€œwhite elephantâ€. In response, cooked food stalls and eating tables were added a year later. By the late 1930s, the market became a site where Teochew theatrical performances were staged during the annual Hungry Ghost Festivals.
The market remained open during the Japanese Occupation. Interestingly, in an attempt to draw hawkers to the market, the Japanese authorities reduced the rental charges on market stalls and controlled all items on sale.  After World War II, Maxwell Road Market became one of the sites where the government had a â€œFamily Restaurantâ€ that sold cheap meals to thousands of poor and displaced. The Maxwell Market restaurant would be the first of a chain of restaurants selling meals at eight cents that the Singapore Social Welfare Department started across Town from December 1946. It also included a children feeding centre that provided free meals for two to six year olds.
The market underwent several significant changes in the post-war years. In January 1949, the municipality passed a rule that municipal markets could only sell perishable goods. All others vendors, like â€œbread and provision sellers and money changersâ€, had to move out by April that year. Maxwell Road Market had two money changers at this time. Then, in 1951, when high food prices became a problem in Singapore, many vendors at Maxwell Road Market were found overcharging. The government implemented measures to control prices at markets facing this problem. In December 1951, the government appointed a firm, Madju Trading Company, to retail beef to markets at 20% below market prices. Maxwell Road Market was among the first three chosen market for this initiative.
Going into the 1960s, although there were ample spaces in 42 public markets, tens of thousands of street hawkers had still decided no remain on the streets. The government markets were at most, only 80% occupied. At Maxwell Road Market, only half the stalls had been taken up. Things only changed in the 1970s, following urban renewal processes in Town. In 1972, when the Telok Ayer Market underwent renovation to be converted into a food centre, 73 of its market produce stalls were relocated to Maxwell Road Market. While on one hand, this became the first time the market had been almost fully occupied, the transference of the market produce vendors to Maxwell Road Market also delayed its own journey towards becoming a food centre.
The first step towards becoming a food centre took place in 1986, when 70 street food hawkers who had been operating under a temporary zinc-and-roof structure along the back lanes around China Square were moved to Maxwell Road Market. They had been operating in the China Street area with makeshift open-aired stalls before being moved to China Square in 1979. Interestingly, these hawkers, the last of the back lane hawkers, had originated from the defunct private Erna Market (1946-48) in Chinatown. At Maxwell Road, they joined 22 other cooked food hawkers. Hence, Maxwell Road Market had been turned into a huge food centre by this time, albeit unplanned. Unfortunately, a couple of years later, all of them had to be moved again when Maxwell itself underwent its own major renovation and transformation.
In 1987, Maxwell Road Market was officially turned into a food centre. Since then, it has become a popular place for traditional Chinese foods.

Walking from one historic site to another is what many tourists enjoy doing whenever they visit a new country. The exploration and discovery of historically significant places enhances one's understanding of a place's past, heritage, culture and people.
Since 1999, the National Heritage Board (NHB) has researched on and developed a series of heritage trails in our heartlands that aims to bring heritage closer to the public, and help residents understand and appreciate the place in which they live, study, work and play in. These heritage trails range from heartland areas such as Toa Payoh, Yishun and Bedok to well-known heritage estates such as Balestier, Kampong Glam and Little India.
In 2013, NHB piloted the Heritage Trail Adoption Scheme with Henderson Secondary School. The then newly launched Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail was adopted by the school and 12 pupils were trained by NHB to be student guides. These student guides would later go on to guide the VIP entourage during the trail's launch.

To promote the use of existing heritage trails and to document the social memories of the estate that we live in, the Heritage Trail Adoption Scheme gives schools the platform to adopt either an NHB heritage trail or a school developed trail for a period of three years. Schools participating in the scheme may choose to undertake the guiding training programme for students or the how-to-teach-guiding training programme designed especially for teachers. The programme also encourages schools to teach heritage in a fun and meaningful way by using the trail for orientation or camp programmes, and to integrate cross-subject learning elements to ensure that the young appreciate the continued relevance of heritage.

Since the programme's launch up to 2017, more than 25 schools have adopted either an NHB Heritage Trail or a school developed trail, and more than 600 students and 30 teachers have been trained under the programme. Today, the scheme is a robust one with a good spread of participation from primary schools, secondary schools and even tertiary institutions.

Suitable for all ages and student profiles, this scheme has benefited both high-potential and average students by equipping them with life skills that go beyond heritage knowledge. The scheme's flexibility to be integrated into curriculum has also brought out teachers' creativity in designing heritage trails that engage students through meaningful exploration and discovery of heritage.

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of Catholic Junior College shares, â€œThe programme has benefited our teachers by equipping them with the knowledge and skills to make learning of heritage and the Mother Tongue Language fun. The programme has also changed our students' perspectives and understanding towards Balestier. They are now more appreciative of the estate that they study in.â€

MuseSG Volume 11 Issue 1 - 2018
Mention Bukit Panjang to any Singaporean and images of a typical Housing & Development Board (HDB) town will likely come to mind. In fact, a peak-hour trip through Bukit Panjang on a Light Rapid Transit (LRT) train will bring one face-to-face with rows of towering residential flats, punctuated occasionally by the odd park or community space. As the train-car glides into Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub, waves of passengers can be glimpsed hurrying along, some bound for the spanking new Hillion Mall. A quick glance, and it is soon apparent that many of these commuters have just arrived via the adjacent Downtown Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line, returning for a day's work in the city.
Half a century ago, however, the commute to Bukit Panjang would have had been made not in air-conditioned comfort, but in a Vulcan omnibus operated by the Green Bus Company.

Trundling down Upper Bukit Timah Road on bus service No. 2, one would have encountered acres of dense foliage, interspersed with factories belching out thick, grey smoke. Every now and then, a cacophony of intoned hawker voices would have wafted through the bus' opened windows, as if attempting to compete with the periodic whistle of the Malayan Railway locomotive as it thundered towards the level crossing at Choa Chu Kang Road. As the bus wound around the traffic circus situated where Junction 10 stands today, a mishmash of zinc and brick shophouses would have come into view.

Known colloquially as chap kor  (â€œtenth mileâ€ in Hokkien), this was Bukit Panjang, a cluster of villages that comprised a few thousand residents during the 1950s.1
What histories were inscribed in the landscape of this seemingly nondescript town; or was it just another town on the byway?
Long before the advent of shopping malls such as Junction 10, â€œtenth mileâ€ had already been used colloquially to refer to Bukit Panjang. In fact, the origins of both toponyms can be traced to the mid-1800s, when a number of settlements emerged at the 10th milestone of Bukit Timah Road, near a 132-metre hill known as Bukit Panjang (which means â€œlong hillâ€ in Malay).2 Initially inhabited by gambier and pepper planters, these settlements began to expand when Bukit Timah Road was extended northwards to Kranji in 1845. In the process, new forms of economic activity such as rubber cultivation were introduced to Bukit Panjang.3 In 1912, the well-known business magnate Ong Sam Leong was reported to have tapped the first tree at his new Bukit Panjang Rubber Estate, which was located at the 101â„2 milestone of Bukit Timah Road. That such estates were likely a defining feature of the then Bukit Panjang landscape is also suggested by a Malaya Tribune report of 1916 announcing the auction of another possibly similar rubber and coconut estate at Chua Chu Kang Road near the Bukit Panjang Railway Station.
Situated near today's Bukit Panjang Post Office, the now defunct Bukit Panjang Railway Station was also integral to the town's rapid growth in the early 1900s. Constructed as part of the Singapore Railway in 1903, it was by 1912 incorporated into the Federated Malay States Railway. This meant that it would have been possible to proceed by train from Bukit Panjang to Holland Road, Cluny Road or even Kuala Lumpur. According to a notice published in the Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser in 1910, trains were scheduled to call at Bukit Panjang station up to five times daily, carrying not only passengers, but also goods, mail, and even stone from the Mandai Quarry. In fact, an early description of Bukit Panjang as a rather unremarkable locale is provided by a Straits Times reporter covering the opening of the railway line in 1903
The engine whistled shrilly and in a few minutes drew up at Bukit Panjang, a small station not quite complete yet, of the Cluny Road type. Here, some Tamil women were noticed carrying baskets of gravel on their heads, the gravel being spread about the floor of the station. A few Chinese coolies came on board here and the train was soon speeding on its way.
As the town continued to evolve in the decades after, it is likely that the earlier image of Bukit Panjang as just another nondescript town became more an anachronism than a true reflection of its identity. Certainly, residents of Bukit Panjang in the 1950s would have been familiar with an altogether different town than the one described in the Straits Times report of 1903. The Bukit Panjang they would have known, far from being mundane, was brimming with verve and assertiveness, for it was a town which doggedly coupled a can-do ethos with a spirit of mutual help as it confronted the challenges of Singapore's early nation-building years. No doubt it was roiled, at times, by the turbulent socio-political currents of the era, but this itself ensured that residents of Bukit Panjang forged a distinct collective identity defined by a strong sense of esprit de corps. Testament to the fact that this spirit of camaraderie was no myth, but was indeed being tangibly expressed, is a speech by the then acting Colonial Secretary J. D. Higham to the newly- formed Bukit Panjang Youth Club in 1954. Praising the club's community centeredness, he pronounced with more than a sliver of prescience, that in Bukit Panjang â€œthere is already a sense of belonging to a groupâ€, from which he predicted would â€œgrow [the] most fruitful movementsâ€.
Part of the reason why a spirit of collegial solidarity began to take root so strongly in Bukit Panjang was the fact that the trunk road which brought development to the town was also the same feature that separated it by ten miles from the city. Indeed, a Singapore Free Press report of 1955 could not resist describing Bukit Panjang as the â€œvegetable basketâ€ of Singapore â€“ a â€œfar off rural constituency of bullock-cart trails, away from the hurly-burly of city lifeâ€. Given this description, one can perhaps understand why residents of Bukit Panjang often came together to fend for themselves, especially in instances when help seemed distant, delayed or deficient. In 1957, for example, the Singapore Improvement Trust launched Bukit Panjang Estate (later renamed Teck Whye Estate), which comprised some 200 single-storey terrace houses.

Branded as a low-cost alternative for workers employed in the Bukit Timah area, the houses were touted in the local press as being â€œexcellent shield[s] against heat and coldâ€, with their construction even bearing the approval stamp of a United Nations expert. Yet, by 1958, tenants were being told tartly by the trust's chairman, J. M. Fraser, that they had to â€œhelp themselvesâ€ when they appealed for assistance to fix asbestos roofs that were producing oven-like indoor temperatures of 38 degrees celsius. In a Straits Times article from 1958, Fraser was even reported to have told tenants that the trust was â€œcharging you a favourable rent which isn't even economical for usâ€. Furious tenants, miffed that their petitions had been ignored, were reported to have organised a meeting at the Bukit Panjang Community Centre to decide on a course of action.4 Perhaps not coincidentally, within two weeks of the meeting, the matter was raised for discussion in the then Legislative Assembly.5
At times, the collective indignation felt by residents and workers of Bukit Panjang towards social injustice was so intense that meetings gave way to strikes, and petitions came to be substituted with the picket. Situated where Tan Chong Industrial Park is standing today, the Nanyang Shoe Factory â€“ where many womenfolk from Bukit Panjang were reputed to have worked â€“ was one compound beset by numerous strikes in the 1950s and 1960s. Although the charged political atmosphere of the day no doubt influenced strikers' demands, newspaper reports from the era also reveal that on most occasions the strikers' grievances stemmed from prosaic bread-and-butter concerns: the desire for a 50-cent wage raise or for overtime allowance to be granted. Industrial action undertaken was thus not necessarily always the handiwork of disruptive elements, but could well have been prompted by workers uniting to seek redress for injustices such as the refusal of a company to pay arrears. Chua Beng Tee, who witnessed many such strikes, recalls that â€œin the past, people took action once they felt aggrieved, no matter if it was a minor issue. That's much less likely to happen today!â€6
While a lively sense of disaffection certainly permeated through the Bukit Panjang of the 1950s and 1960s, more often than not the response it prompted amongst residents was a spirited attempt to channel this restiveness for a greater good. Bukit Panjang Community Centre, in particular, stood out for its many initiatives that attempted to tackle issues of both local and national dimensions. In 1955, the centre organised Singapore's inaugural district horti-agricultural show, which included demonstrations for farmers, displays of crops, and even advice for carp breeders. At the show's opening, then Chief Minister David Marshall publicly commended Bukit Panjang Community Centre for their public spirit in organising such an event, which he opined was â€œof great assistanceâ€.

Not to be outdone, the community centre further down at Jalan Kong Kuan was also reported to have organised its fair share of charitable activities, on occasion using the Sin Wah Theatre near Lorong Ah Thia to screen shows as part of its fund-raising programmes.

Beyond the walls of such community institutions, it would be remiss to disregard the many instances in which this sense of public-spiritedness found expression through ground-up grassroots initiatives, pursued by ordinary Bukit Panjang residents of all races and creeds. A particularly revealing case involves the former Lembaga Masjid Jamik, which in 1960 began a building fund drive to build a mosque in Bukit Panjang, as the next nearest mosque was some seven miles away. Not content with merely raising funds, more than 100 volunteers from Bukit Panjang came together as part of a self-styled â€œOperation Masjidâ€, helping to clear the site on which the mosque would be constructed. The mosque, originally named Jamek Mosque, was subsequently renamed Al-Khair in 1963, and continues to serve the Muslim community at 1 Teck Whye Crescent today.
Over at Bukit Panjang Government High School, which was established as Bukit Panjang Secondary School in 1957, students who had barely turned 13 banded together when they arrived at their new school premises in Jalan Teck Whye in 1959 to find that there were no desks and chairs.7 Professor Low Cheng Hock, who was amongst the school's first batch of students, recalls how all the students rushed to help carry the school furniture from a lorry when it arrived two weeks later. As weeks passed, the entire cohort even transformed the barren land behind the school into a proper field by planting grass seeds and nurturing it with cow dung.8

Peh Ching Boon, who attended the school in the 1960s, also discovered how valuable the close-knit ties amongst Bukit Panjang residents could be when on one occasion, a handful of students mischievously released the air valve of his bicycle's tyres. Fortunately, he was spared a trek home by virtue of his uncle's friendship with the school's doctor, who brought him to a nearby shop to repair the leak. Moreover, he was even told he could henceforth park his bicycle outside the Principal's office!9

Fast forward to today, the Bukit Panjang of the mid-20th century is scarcely recognisable amidst the rows of towering HDB flats. Nonetheless, a spirit of camaraderie continues to flourish amidst the high-rise urbanscape, testifying to the esprit de corps so strongly embedded in the town's heritage.

For example, even as new initiatives such as community gardens have emerged, longstanding community institutions such as the Bukit Panjang Youth Club continue to flourish too, with the latter even pioneering signature programmes such as FoodNotes, a youth-led food donation drive for the needy.

Emblematic of the extent to which Bukit Panjang has managed to carve out a distinct identity is perhaps the sheer fact that its place-name continues to be used widely amongst Singaporeans, in lieu of the less familiar â€œZhenghuaâ€. In fact, â€œZhenghuaâ€ had been chosen to replace â€œBukit Panjangâ€ as part of a government initiative in the 1980s to rechristen towns with â€œpinyinisedâ€ toponyms, but the original place-name was reinstated after a spirited public debate (Bukit Panjang was the only town in Singapore in which a reversal of the policy was effected).10 On hindsight, one can surmise from the episode that Singaporeans are, without a doubt, cognisant of the importance of place identities and histories, and how these work in concert to distinguish places like Bukit Panjang from being mere towns on the byway. In the words of geographers Brenda Yeoh and Lily Kong, it is only logical that:
Place and history are closely intertwined in the rich texture of individual and social life. There is no history without place, and no place without history; to lose sight of one would be to lose a sense of the other.11

Notes",Roots Website,Bukit Panjang More Than Just A Town On The Byway
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/We-built-a-nation/We-Built-a-Nation,"Singapore became an independent country following its exit from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. Thrust into nationhood amid a volatile regional climate plagued by conflict (Indonesia was waging an undeclared war, the Konfrontasi, to oppose the formation of Malaysia), Singapore's founding generation of leaders focused on cohesiveness to ensure its survival. In the words of Singapore's first President Mr Yusof Ishak â€œIf we are to remain a cohesive people, we must concentrate on the factors which bind us together, and not those which will divide us.""
This ideal set the tone for the policies made during Singapore's first decade of independence. Its founding generation of leaders, led by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew strove to build a multiracial and multicultural society that accorded equality to all citizens regardless of race, language or religion. These policies, especially in the areas of defence, housing, education and economy, have helped to lay the foundations of the Singapore that we know today.

Mr Rajaratnam said in a Parliamentary speech in 1967: â€œIn a democracy, there can be no distinction between majority rights and minority rights. There can only be equality of rights, the same rights for all, without regard to race, colour, language or creed.â€ (Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore)
Building up a capable defence force
As a newly independent nation in a turbulent region, Singapore now had some responsibility for its defence and had to move quickly to develop a capable defence force. Defence Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee was given the monumental task of building up its defence force. The People's Defence Force (PDF), a part-time paramilitary unit was established in 1965 and by March 1966, some 3,200 volunteers registered with the PDF.

However, the lack of military training and small numbers of the PDF, coupled with the impending withdrawal of British troops led Dr Goh to conclude that compulsory conscription was needed to meet Singapore's defence needs. The British had implemented a National Service Bill in 1954. However, large-scale protests by Chinese middle school students led to the Colonial government postponing its implementation. The was re-introduced when Dr Goh announced that a pioneer batch of 9,000 youths were eligible for National Service call-ups during the second reading of the National Service (Amendment) Bill on 13 March 1967.

Dr Goh positioned National Service (NS) as a form of nation-building. In a parliamentary speech, Dr Goh said: â€œNothing creates loyalty and national consciousness more speedily and more thoroughly than participation in defence and membership of the armed forces.â€ While street demonstrations opposing the call-ups were staged, there was much stronger support for NS this time around, in part due to the support of University of Singapore Student Union and Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
To date, more than one million male Singaporeans and second-generation permanent residents have served NS in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force or Singapore Civil Defence Force. NS is now seen as a rite of passage for all Singaporean males.
Housing a nation
Another challenge that Singapore's founding leaders had to overcome during its early years was housing a growing population. The Housing Development Board (HDB) was formed shortly after Singapore attained self-government in February 1960. Led by their first chairman Lim Kim San, HDB built 31,317 flats in three years. This is in stark contrast with the 23,019 housing units HDB's predecessor, the Singapore Improvement Trust, built during their 32 years of existence.

Developing our Economy
The 1961 State Development Plan was the first official blueprint for Singapore's economic development following our attainment of self-governance in 1959. The plan involved labour-intensive factories as well as technology-intensive investments such as oil refineries. The four-year plan aimed to end economic stagnation and reduce the high unemployment rate by expanding manufacturing.
Following Singapore's independence, its founding leaders made it a priority to focus on industrialisation. Singapore was at a disadvantage due to its small domestic market and lack of natural resources. These factors, coupled with Singapore's separation from Malaysia â€“ ending all hopes of a common market Â­â€“ led the government to adopt an export-orientated development strategy which also included attracting multinational corporations to establish manufacturing bases in Singapore.
PM Lee said: â€œWe had one simple guiding principle for survival: that Singapore had to be more rugged, better organised and more efficient than others in the region. If we were only as good as our neighbours there was no reason for businesses to be based here. We had to make it possible for investors to operate successfully and profitably in Singapore despite our lack of a domestic market and natural resources.â€
By the 1970s, the manufacturing sector evolved to attract higher-end investments such as those from the electronics sector. Singapore registered a strong gross domestic product growth and achieved nearly full employment by the mid-1970s. Wages and the standard of living also rose correspondingly.

Reforming the education system
Singapore's founding leaders also emphasised the importance of investing in its future generations. The government introduced education policies to support national integration and nation-building. Every child would be provided with at least six years of education from the age of six â€“ without discrimination based on race, language, sex, wealth or status. The Compulsory Education Act of 2000 eventually made six years of primary education mandatory for all children born after 1st January 1996.

(Ministry of Information and the ArtsCollection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore)
A key facet of Singapore's education system is the policy of bilingualism, which was launched for primary level in 1960 and secondary level in 1966. Students learn two languages: English, which is used as a working language that enables people from different ethnic backgrounds to communicate with each other, and an additional second language (either Mandarin, Malay or Tamil), which in 1979 was specified as the student's official mother tongue for them to remain connected with their ethnic group's cultural roots.
Laying a strong foundation
The progress made during its first 10 years of independence laid a strong foundation for Singapore's transformation from a nation that many did not expect to survive into the Singapore that we know today â€“ a thriving, first-world country, a Singapore for Singaporeans.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Changi-Village-Hawker-Centre,"The Changi Village Hawker Centre was built in 1975 as part of the government's initiative to create a leisure and recreation district at the far flung eastern end of the island. Changi Point had been an idyllic village in the pre-war years when the British military moved in to set up bases. From 1927, a local settlement sprang up near these camps to cater to the needs of these military men and their families. It became their place of their recreation and provision shopping outside the camps. This enterprise became Changi Village.

After World War II, Changi Village continued its pre-war function as an off-base suburbia for the British troops stationed at Changi. The community had been a multicultural one, and the 1960s, they had all been part of the retail establishment that made Changi Village a convenient market place for the British military at Changi. By this time, Changi Village was also well-known for its cheap buys and a place for bargain hunters. In the 1960s, there was also a (street) â€œmarketâ€ in the village with an open space that the Ministry of Culture screened movies for the villagers. There was also an â€œAmah's Marketâ€ at Changi Village every Wednesday night when the shopkeepers brought down prices to compete with the market stallholders.
Then everything changed after 1967 when the British announced their withdrawal from Singapore by 1972. By 1971, after tens of thousands of British servicemen and dependants have mostly gone, the once blooming suburbia had become a struggling kampong. This was when the Singapore Government introduced plans to reinvent Changi Village, and the hawker centre was born as part of this initiative.
The plan was to create a population catchment in the district and to make the Changi Village a magnet for locals and tourists. While creating light industries in the Loyang area and the establishment of New Towns in the eastern part of the island would meet the first objective, the development of recreational areas in the district would complete the second. However, by 1973, the government found that the whole undertaking needed a further boost. Changi Point was turned into a resort destination in order to give the district â€œa new lease of lifeâ€, and a part of this new plan was to build a new housing estate at Changi Village with a modern market and hawker centre.
The new hawker centre was completed in 1975. By 1976, a cooked food centre with 74 stalls and a market with 78 stalls were operational. By the 1980s, the new hawker centre was most crowded during lunch time. It was thronged by soldiers and air force personnel from nearby camps, workers from the airport and the Loyang Industrial Estate. There were also the holiday-makers from the numerous holiday bungalows at Changi Point. In the evening, nearby residents formed the bulk of Changi Village's patrons.
However, business volume at the new Changi Village did not return to the levels when the British military was still around. The shopkeepers around the market who returned when the new HDB blocks were built had also found the going tough.
By 2000, Changi Village Hawker Centre had become dated and required repairs. This was its first major revamp. The centre underwent another revamp a decade later in 2012 when it was closed for 10 months for upgrading.
Changi Village Hawker Centre shares a number of similarities with the other centres built during the 1970s. Like the centre at the East Coast Lagoon, it was also created with the intent of making it part of a seaside resort. And like the Lagoon, the centre struggled through the 1980s from low business volume.
Today, Changi Village Hawker Centre has become a dining place set within a laid back suburbia environ, where patrons of come for its popular cuisine which include the nasi lemak (Malay fragrant rice dish). In the evenings, crowds gather here to hang out and have their favourite foods and drinks. Despite renovations over the years, the hawker centre has retained its old charm and laid-back atmosphere. It has become an iconic part of Changi and a convenient stopover for weekend fishing enthusiasts from the region, as well as locals holidaying at the bungalows nearby.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Blk-51-Old-Airport-Road,"Old Airport Road Food Centre was built in 1972 to resettle street hawkers found all around Kallang Estate. This estate was created following the closure of Kallang Airport in 1955. After which, the Singapore Improvement Trust built low-cost housing in the district to accommodate squatters who had been cleared from the Town areas. The area on which this new estate was constructed was actually the old airport's runway. This became the Kallang Airport Estate. A market was also erected as part of the estate's development. Initially called the Jalan Empat Market, it was later renamed Kallang Estate Fresh Market & Food Centre.

When it was completed in 1958, it provided the estate with 172 stalls for fresh and cooked foods. Yet, by the 1960s, these stalls were inadequate to accommodate all the street hawkers who had gathered at the estate. In response, the government erected sheltered pitches all around the market in 1963. The makeshift measure expanding the market added spaces for 315 additional hawkers. This essentially doubled the number of stalls at the market. However, there was still a need for a more permanent solution to the hawker problem at Kallang.
The solution was found in 1972 with the building of Old Airport Road Hawker Centre as part of the Kallang Airport Estate Redevelopment Scheme. The new facility was an Emporium-cum-Hawker Centre with food stalls on the ground floor and shopping on the upper levels of the building. When it was completed, it was considered the most modern hawker centre, which had incorporated the latest architectural designs.
The new hawker centre, costing $2.5 million, accommodated 176 food stalls on its ground floor and 136 shop units on its upper floor. It was built as part of the government's 1970s plan to relocate street hawkers into purpose-built food centers which had no wet market attached. Also, in terms of design, the Old Airport Road Food Centre reflected same design of those food centres erected in New Towns of the 1960s and 1970s, like those at Woodlands and Commonwealth Avenue. These hawker centres were by and large flat roofed and had two-levels to cater to the needs of a densely populated district.
However, unlike the other flat roof two-level hawker centres of the time, the food centre at Old Airport Road had enough space to serve other public and â€œcivic functionsâ€. Besides the emporium on level two, the also had a Post Office branch and a POSB ATM.
Right from the start, the new food centre became a haunt for diners in search of the best local foods. The hawker centre's proximity to the city also made it a convenient supper stopover for revellers after a night out in town. Through the years, 51 Old Airport Road has become famous for being one of the best places to eat at reasonable prices. In recent years, the food centre also started seeing more tourists visiting.
In 1973, a hawker stall in the centre, Khoon Kee Chicken Rice, won the very first competition for the â€œCleanest Cooked Food Stallâ€ in Singapore, sponsored by the Rotary Club.
The food centre underwent upgrading between 2006 and 2007. The facelift, which cost the NEA $5.8 million, was its largest upgrading initiatives under the Hawker Centre Upgrading Programme till that point in time. Being a widely patronised hawker centre, the seating capacity was increased to 1904 with the addition of new dining areas. By this time, the second level also accommodated a kindergarten.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Chomp-Chomp-Food-Centre,"Created at the heart of Serangoon Gardens Estate in 1972, Chomp Chomp Food Centre is a part of the district's suburbia charm. The estate was established in the 1950s by a private developer who built over a former rubber plantation and Chinese kampong. When completed in 1956, Serangoon Gardens provided accommodation for the English-speaking middle-class civil servants of Singapore.

It did not take too long for street hawkers to make a beeline for the newly opened estate. By 1960, the middle of the district had been so congested by food hawkers that clashes arose. A year later, the government built the residents of the Serangoon Garden Estate their first market. Yet, the street hawkers proliferated and many of them set up their stalls around an empty piece of land in front of the Serangoon Garden Circus, between Farleigh Avenue and Serangoon Garden Way (at the present-day bus-stop). Again, the limited space led to clashes. Following this, 30 hawkers from the site were relocated to the nearby Maju Avenue where they set up sheds on both sides of the road. The original empty ground was then paved and transformed into an â€œeating esplanadeâ€ where 25 street hawkers plied their trade. These were the hawkers who would eventually become the pioneers of Chomp Chomp.
Chomp Chomp was finally built on a piece of ground along Kensington Park Road, opposite the â€œeating esplanadeâ€. In May 1972, Chomp Chomp Hawker Centre was officially opened by then then Minster for Law and National Development, E W Barker. It was the third of the purpose-built hawker centres which not attached to any market then, and after Serangoon Gardens, there were plans to build six more these kind of hawker centres in Singapore. Chomp Chomp was also one of the four projects started by the then MP for Serangoon Garden and Parliamentary Secretary of Home Affairs, L P Rodrigo, for his constituency. The hawkers who had their stalls at the â€œeating esplanadeâ€ were moved to Chomp Chomp when it opened. Built at cost of $95,000, the new hawker centre opened with 36 built-in stalls, with sinks, wash basins and electric neon lights at each stall. The stallholders had to provide their own tables and chairs for their customers and they had to move them whenever it rained. The tables and chairs were kept and stored in their stalls at the end of the day.
The English name of the hawker centre was actually a loose adaptation of its Teochew name, Tiong Tiong. The Mandarin equivalent is zhong zhong, which Chinese characters stood for loyalty and righteousness. The name Chomp Chomp was chosen by the committee the hawkers had formed among themselves. Boys from Serangoon Garden Secondary School helped put up the â€œChomp Chompâ€ signboard at the front of the centre. Chomp Chomp was also officially known as the Serangoon Garden Food Centre.
Over time, Chomp Chomp became a very popular visit for locals and tourists alike. One reason for its success during its early years was because it was well supported by the children in the schools of the area. There was also a movie theatre nearby. They had formed a significant client base for the hawker centre. By 1987, Chomp Chomp was touted as one of the five most popular food centres with highest business volume on the island. It came alive in the evenings when diners thronged the place for their dinner and supper.
In 1996, most of the stallholders of Chomp Chomp went from being renters to becoming owners of their own stalls in the hawker centre under the government's Stall Ownership Scheme. Following this, Chomp Chomp received a new roof in 1998. The Environment Ministry (ENV) built a roof over the customer seating areas. After the centre reopened in April 1998, customers were no longer subjected to the elements while they dined. Together with other renovations, the 1998 upgrading cost $265,000. Chomp Chomp underwent another upgrading in 2003 to make its outlook â€œfit in with the rest of the upgraded estateâ€.
Today, Chomp Chomp remains one of the most popular local eateries. It was voted Singaporeans' favourite hawker centre in 2011, 2012 and 2013 by the City Hawker Food Hunt.

With a mouth-watering range of dishes that reflects the melting pot of cultures in Singapore, hawker centres have long served as places where Singaporeans can bond, interact and connect through our shared love for food.
As icons of Singapore's food heritage, hawker centres are cultural nodes and the sources of Singapore's much loved traditional foods of various communities. Many of the hawker centres have roots which can be traced to our street food heritage, and are where Singaporeans and tourists alike will be able to discover the nation's rich culinary diversity.
From the People's Park Food Centre, which started as a humble â€œfood shelterâ€ about a century ago to the Changi Village Hawker Centre that has grown into a modern foodie's paradise, Singapore's hawker centres have cemented themselves into the socio-cultural identity of the places they are located in.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Tekka-Market,"When Tekka Market was built in 1915, it was first called the Kandang Kerbau Market, taking the name of the district which was associated with the cattle and meat trade. The south Indians called the market â€œMattu Kampong Pasarâ€ in Tamil, a literal translation from the Malay name.
Plans for the market could be traced back to 1909 when the municipality decided to develop the whole area as part of the Kampong Kapor Improvement Scheme. Hence, when works started, the surrounding shophouses were also erected around the same time. One of these is today's Little India Arcade, completed in 1913. The market was completed later as the grounds on which the market was to be erected had to be purchased from the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowment Board at a cost of $25,000 and there was a general lack of funds at that time. After the mounting of the steel structures in 1913, there was a pause in works till the municipality awarded a contract of $30,000 to complete the market building. By July 1915, the market was completed and had opened in the first week of august. The Municipal Engineer who designed the market was Robert Peirce. He gave the market a colonial outlook with multiple archway and ornate steel carvings.
By the 1930s, Kandang Kerbau Market was famed for having been the â€œpeople's marketâ€. It was popular with all the different ethnic groups for its wide variety of fresh meat, vegetables and seafood, as well as the retail goods that were sold there.
During the Japanese Occupation years, Kandang Kerbau Market become a distribution centre for the fruits and vegetable grown at Bahau (Negri Sembilan), a food growing colony the Japanese started with Singapore residents resettled there. In August 1944, the market was also made a distribution centre for newly hatched chicks which were given to the people of the area to rear so that they could help manage their own food requirements. 
After the war, the market was supposed to be fully rehabilitated. However, the government lacked funds as everything had to be rebuilt and repaired at the same time. Hence, when the extension of the market was proposed in 1948, the municipality decided that it was cheaper to repair and redecorate the market instead. And even after a budget was set aside for this in 1948, funds meant for the fencing of Maxwell Road Market had to be diverted to complete the works at Kandang Kerbau Market.
Times were harsh in the post-war days. Yet, it was during this time that the stallholders of the market formed amongst themselves, the Kandang Kerbau Market Dealers' Association. In 1952, the association got together to donate their produce to the Little Sisters of the Poor who were supporting others who were in more difficulties than them.
By the 1960s-70s, the area around the market had been inundated by illegal street hawkers. There was just not enough space in the market to accommodate all 400 of them. The market at this time had housed 300 vendors. In 1971, as quick fix, the government licenced all the hawkers outside the market for four years. This was ironically, an unintended long waited â€œextensionâ€ of the market.  
By the mid-1970s, it was clear that the whole Kampong Kapor district needed renewal. The Kandang Kerbau Complex was conceived as a replacement for the market. The new site, situated across the road, started ground works in August 1979. The new Market was completed by early 1981 and the stallholders moved in on 3 May 1981.
Designed as a residential-cum-shopping complex with three tower blocks of residential flats and a market on the ground level, the development marked the first step towards the redevelopment of the world district. When the new market was opened, it was initially called Buffalo Road Market and Cook Food Centre. Then in November 1981, as part of the national Speak Mandarin Campaign and movement to â€œhanyu-pinyinizeâ€ place names in Singapore, it was renamed Zhujiao Centre. This was met with some disquiet among some residents of the district as could not identify the heritage of the district with the Mandarin name. The new complex was then renamed Tekka Centre in 2000.
Many of the stallholders at old Tekka Market are second or third generation hawkers whose forefathers set up shop in the old market 30 to 50 years ago.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Peoples-Park-Food-Centre,"The People's Park Food Centre had its beginnings as a humble â€œfood shelterâ€ set up by the municipality in 1923 to provide cover for street hawkers in the area. The first shelter had proven to be so popular amongst the hawkers that within months after its opening, more were added and the municipality â€œturnedâ€ it into a market. By 1930, such was its success that it was made into a day and night market. From then, it continued growing. By 1940, the market had 323 stalls, making it Singapore's largest market then. It was during this time that the market had become famous for its durian stalls, which remained open until 2 am for fruit lovers. It was this legacy that made it Singapore's first and oldest pasar malam (â€œnight marketâ€ in Malay).

The market did not close during the Japanese Occupation. In 1944, the People's Park Market was chosen by the Japanese as one of several chick distribution centres in Town. The programme was designed to help people rear their own chicken in order for them to manage their own food supply.
The old market was divided into many tall sheds which rested on cemented platforms raised slightly above ground level. It had two sections (front and back), separated by a metallic fence. The stalls in the front was where the dry goods were and the wet-market stalls were at the back. The wet market's entrance faced the side of the Majestic Theatre. After the end of the Japanese Occupation, the stalls at the front continued their business while the wet market behind was moved.  In its place, a textiles bazaar arose. Many of the post-war stallholders had plied their trade at temporary markets in Town which were started soon after the British return. By late 1940s, the municipality demolished most of them and relocated them in municipal markets. Many of them were given spaces at People's Park Market. By 1949, the market had 984 stalls engaged in day and night hawking.
In 1957, the People's Park Market reached another landmark when the Singapore Agricultural Co-operative Union, which comprised of all vegetable growers in Singapore, started a wholesale market there. This meant that the vegetables at the market came directly from the Singapore farms, making them cheaper and fresher. 
Everything changed in December 1966 when a great fire wiped out 186 stalls and shops, causing a million dollars in damages. This unintentionally brought forward the government's plan to rebuild the People's Park Market as part of the district's urban renewal. Some of the stallholders had already been served notices to quit prior to the fire.
A temporary market adjacent to the fire area was built in 1967 to house all the stalls during the rebuilding. In this way, they would not lose their loyal customers, many of whom were tourists who had come to the market to buy Indian and Japanese textiles. This temporary â€œshopping centreâ€ was called the Singapore People's Park Textiles and Sundries New Market.
By mid-1969, the first phase of Singapore's then biggest â€œshopping cum residential complexâ€  had been completed and the shops and stallholders started moving in and commenced business. At this time, the eateries were already touted as a â€œfavourite of Singaporeansâ€. When completed, the new three-storey complex (not including the housing block above), had lifts but no escalators as yet. While the food stalls, 75 in all, were located on the first level, the retail and textiles shops occupied the second and third levels. By this time, the food centre had become a favourite visit of many tourists from Southeast Asia.
One important legacy from the old days which was brought to the new complex was the â€œno free seatingâ€ issue at the food centre. In the old market, stallholders had to provide their own tables and chairs. Naturally, these were meant for their own patrons. Interestingly, this continued at the new market and faced many complaints. The matter was only put to rest in 1992 when the government installed fixed tables and chairs.
The first major upgrading renovation People's Park Centre underwent occurred in February 2005. The $5 million endeavour made the centre â€œgreener, cooler and brighterâ€. The upgrading was done as part of the National Environment Agency's Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme. There were 89 food stalls and 80 retail outlets in the upper levels of the centre before the facelift. After the upgrading, the centre had 85 food stalls and around 160 shops on the upper levels.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Tiong-Bahru-Market-Food-Centre,"The popular Tiong Bahru Market opened in 1951 as Seng Poh Road Market. It was then just â€œa simple wooden structure with zinc pitched roofâ€. Named after the street commemorating Singapore's first Chinese Municipal Commissioner, Tan Seng Poh, the market was built to house a large number of street hawkers who had served the rapidly growing community at Tiong Bahru. It became an instant draw for the residents, many of whom had relocated from Chinatown.

Many of the first vendors of the market were stallholders of an earlier â€œtemporaryâ€ market which was built in 1940. It was just a series of sheds which had become an eyesore, a fire hazard, and far too small for the needs of the Tiong Bahru residents by the late 1940s. The estate had been growing steadily. In 1948, the government started building more than a dozen additional SIT blocks in the district which were ready for occupation from mid-1949. In September 1949, new plans were made to erect a further 18 blocks of flats in Tiong Bahru and Alexander Estates. By December 1949, the municipality decided that it was time to erect a permanent and larger market for the estate along Seng Poh Road.
Works on the new market started in 1950 and it was completed by the end of that year. Officially named the Seng Poh Road Market, it was built to allow for cooked food stalls. In those early days, the new market also functioned as a kind of â€œTown Hallâ€, where important meeting were held and attended by residents of the district. The first of such gatherings occurred in March 1951 when the â€œtownâ€ gathered to decide on the establishment of a community centre for Tiong Bahru. It became a Polling Centre for the 1951 Legislative Council elections, and in 1953, it played the same role for the City Council elections. In the 1960s, political rallies were held there.
By the 1970s, the old market was in great need of repair, looking old and dirty, there were also street hawkers lining its pavements. A decade later, besides serving the residents of the estate, the cooked food stalls in the market had also become important to, and a favourite of, a large number of nurses (from SGH) in the morning and office workers during lunch time. The old market was fundamentally a single-storey building with a triangular layout and had more than one entrances. The cooked food stalls were along the length of the back as well as taking up the whole of the right hand corner of the market. The food centre was arranged courtyard-style with the stalls ringing a central courtyard. The food centre, located outside the back of the market, was officially called Lim Liak Street Hawker Centre (Block 84A). When the whole market was revamped in 1993, it was renamed Tiong Bahru Market.
The biggest change for Tiong Bahru Market took place in 2004-06 when the market and food centre were closed and a new building was erected. The new centre has also been endowed with user-friendly features with lifts, escalators and bigger stalls. Parts of the new building also incorporated an Art Deco style to complement the architecture of the surrounding estate.
The Tiong Bahru Market & Food Centre is a two-storey building with a large central garden courtyard on a triangulated site. The fresh market, located on the first level, consists of 255 provision shops and wet produce stalls. The provision shops lining the peripheries help to enclose the morning wet produce market from the main road and generate night life to the building as they close late. The food court on the second level houses 85 food stalls surrounding pockets of eating spaces, with a seating capacity of 1,050. There is an urban park and garden as well as car parking facilities at the roof deck. All floors are handicapped accessible.
Since the 1970s, the market and food court had already became known for its tradition foods, â€œspecialising in Chinese breakfast foods and local specialitiesâ€. The market had food items which were not part of the â€œnormal market breakfast repertoireâ€ such as Cantonese chee cheong fun and wu thow kou. There was only one Malay stall at that time.

Before he was president, Yusof Ishak (12 August 1910â€“23 November 1970) was a weightlifting champion, boxer extraordinaire and dedicated newspaperman. Today, we remember his life and imprint on society via a currency series which features his portrait.
Champion weightlifter and budding journalist
Singapore's first president, Yusof Ishak, was already capturing headlines in his youth. His victory at the 1932 Aw Boon Par Cup for boxing, and his subsequent success as national lightweight champion in weightlifting, earned him mentions in the press.
Yusof who attended Victoria Bridge School (Victoria School) and later Raffles Institution, had moved to the island from Perak with his family in 1923.2 Academically brilliant, he earned distinctions in his Cambridge examinations and only narrowly missed out on the highly coveted Queen's Scholarship.3

Apart from sports, Yusof ventured into journalism, taking on the role of co-editor at the Rafflesian, a magazine at his school.

Yusof was eager to pursue law, however, his family could not afford to send him abroad to further his studies.4
Establishing a newspaper for the Malays
Yusof did a brief stint with the Police Academy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia before returning to Singapore to carve out a career in journalism.
Together with friends Ong Chin Beng and Soh Swee Tuck, Yusof started a fortnightly magazine called Sportsman which married his two interests â€” athletics and journalism.
Later, he joined Warta Malaya, a newspaper owned by the Alsagoffs â€” a wealthy Arab family. Starting off as a clerk, he rose through its ranks and became its acting editor.
His experience at the Muslim-oriented paper sparked his desire to launch a more Malay-centric publication run and owned by Malays. Together with Abdul Rahim Kajai and about 20 other Malay community leaders, he set up the Utusan Melayu at Queen Street.
Yusof was 27 at the time. To finance the newspaper, he worked the ground, selling shares to members of the Malay community in Singapore and southern Johor. He was also responsible for assembling a capable team of journalists and editors, and sourcing for advertisers as well as equipment, among other responsibilities.
The paper, which had its first print run in May 1939, faced a number of challenges including stiff competition from rival publications. Yusof resigned from the publication around the time political party United Malays National Organisation started buying shares in the company.5
Becoming president
Yusof's passion for the Malay community and desire to serve his land, caught the eye of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who invited him to chair the city's Public Service Commission in 1959.6
Within the same year he was appointed Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore, or head of state following the People's Action Party's landslide election victory in 1959.
In 1959, Singapore achieved self-governance, a milestone this souvenir plate commemorates. As part of the city's transition from British to local hands, colonial governor William Goode was replaced by Yusof Ishak.7
He also became Singapore's first president after the Republic gained independence in 1965. His promotion of multiracialism helped generate confidence in the new nation and regime.8 Like his early career in the newspaper business, Yusof took to walking the ground, calming nerves and explaining the rationale behind separation from Malaysia.9

Dutiful and steadfast in his role as Singapore's president, Yusof passed on from heart failure in 1970 while still in office, leaving behind his wife Puan Noor Aishah and their three children.10
Yusof is remembered lovingly in a number of ways today. For instance, his genial portrait graces a currency series which has been in circulation since 1999.11 A mosque, think-tank and professorship were also named after him in the 2010s.12

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/street-names-in-singapore/story,"TL;DR
Oxford Street, Auckland Road, Mandalay Road. Dozens of streets in Singapore bear the names of iconic places in the Commonwealth, reflecting the city's roots as a British colony. Other road names here draw inspiration from our rich culture and everyday life. Vested with meaning and encoded with our unique DNA, the names of our streets serve as accessible starting points to revisit and unpack the city's rich repository of stories. â€œTravelâ€ back in time with us as we take you on a brief journey of Singapore's toponymics.
Mapping out early Singapore
As soon as the British arrived, they started building roads to support the rapid development of the new trading post. In the early years, place names were very practical in nature which gave rise to sites like Commercial Square, Market Street and Hospital Road.1
A view of Commercial Square during the 1860s. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Irishman G. D. Coleman was assigned by the British to conduct Singapore's first official topographical survey. Completed in 1829, the survey captures early road infrastructure such as Flint Street, Circular Road and Tanjong Pagar Road.2 (Image from the National Archives of Singapore)
During subsequent stages of town planning, the city was divided into racial and occupational quarters, as per the instructions of Sir Stamford Raffles.3 Published in 1828,4 the plan comprised zones such as Kampong Glam for Bugis and Arabs merchants, land upstream of the Singapore River for the Chulias, and space southwest of the Singapore River for the Chinese.5 As the colony developed, marshes, swamps and jungle were cleared. In turn, more roads were carved out. Among them: Queen Street, Coleman Street and Pickering Street â€” all of which were named after prominent British figures and officials.6
The names of community leaders such as Lim Nee Soon (12 November 1879-20 March 1936) were also etched onto street signs. Lim, known for his rubber empire, has a record number of streets named after him â€” a staggering 26.7 Lim had acquired and leased large tracts of land along the Seletar River area within the boundaries of present-day Yishun, for his rubber business.7
In all, just 40 of 540 road names, as compiled in the book Toponymics: A Study of Singapore Street Names, are named after women. Jalan Hajijah is one of them. It was named after a heiress known as Hajjah Hajijah who founded a Malay kampung on land she had purchased off Upper East Coast Road.9 The kampung, likely established in the 1900s, had about 30 houses. It was demolished in the 1980s.10
Some place names reflected economic activities in the area. For instance, the cultivation of lemongrass plants gave rise to the name Geylang Serai. Serai means lemongrass in Malay.
It was the same for Dhoby Ghaut. Dhobis or laundrymen could often be found knee-deep in the freshwater stream now known as Stamford Canal washing bundles of garments. The washermen utilised a plot of land nearby to dry the clothes. Ghaut or ghatin in Hindi refers to the area along a riverbank used for bathing or washing.
A 2ha plot of land (on the right) where dhobis (washermen) dried their clients' laundry.
The local populace put their own spin on some of these assigned names. For instance, they preferred to call Chinatown's Kreta Ayer (water cart in Malay) goo cia chwee in Hokkien. The name translates to â€œbullock cart waterâ€, a direct reference to the bullock carts which used to supply the area with fresh water.11
Within British military camps and compounds, roads were named after famous British streets. Some posit that it was a way to help servicemen deal with homesickness.
We've also â€œborrowedâ€ place names from the region resulting in Tanjong Katong's Ipoh Lane (Malaysia), Bencoolen Street (Indonesia) in the Bras Basah area, Little India's Madras Road (India), as well as Mandalay Road (Myanmar) in Novena.12
Post-independence naming conventions
Singapore began to shape its own toponymic policies after independence and the decision was made to retain colonial-era road names.13 It was too disorienting to do an overhaul. It also did not make much sense to wipe out Singapore's past in one fell swoop.14
Nonetheless, an advisory committee for the naming of roads and streets established in 1967, suggested modifications to existing public street names to foster a sense of national identity.15 Malay place names, for instance, were recommended, which explains the city's jalans and lorongs.16
A year later, a committee to standardise street names in Chinese, and to provide English translations for Chinese and dialect place names, was set up.
Overtime, the authorities gave prominence to local culture and heritage, as well as leaders and public figures who were integral in influencing Singapore's post-independence trajectory.
For instance, newfangled structures such as a $110 million bridge, which opened in 1981 as part of the East Coast Parkway, was named after Singapore's second president Benjamin Sheares.17
Furthermore, Singapore's pool of languages was tapped to reflect the city's multicultural makeup. Take the case of Jurong industrial estate: the area is home to Fan Yoong Road (prosperity, in Mandarin), Neythal Road (to weave as clothes, in Tamil), and Jalan Tukang (skilled craftsman, in Malay).
In 2003, the Street and Building Names Board was established.18 It vets and approves the naming and renaming of buildings, estates as well as streets proposed by building owners and developers. In 2010, the Urban Redevelopment Authority took over its secretariat role.
The Street and Building Names Board encourages the retention of heritage in naming sites to â€œreinforce a greater sense of history and identity among the communityâ€. The 2009 decision to name a street leading to the School of the Arts in Dhoby Ghaut as Zubir Said Drive, after the composer of Singapore national anthem, reflects just this. The board also prioritises names which can help emergency services locate places fast.19
Old street names, remarkable stories
Lavender Street
A view of Lavender Street in the late 19th to early 20th century. This street reeked due to the liberal use of night soil as fertiliser by the owners of vegetable gardens in the area.20 The name Lavender was picked for the site in 1858 as an ironic nod to the pungent odours it had come to be known for.21 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
High Street
This is likely the oldest street in Singapore. It was developed after Sir Stamford Raffles' landing in 1819 and named as such due to its topography.22 It also once served as a high-end shopping stretch.23 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Beach Road
Once a coastal stretch, Beach Road appears in G. D. Coleman's 1836 map of Singapore. It was originally set aside for European merchants.24 (c. Late 1970s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Coleman Street
Coleman Street was named after Singapore's first pioneer colonial architect who shaped early Singapore's look. G. D. Coleman designed the Old Parliament House (The Arts House today) and the Armenian Church, among other landmark buildings. He was also responsible for the first topographical survey of the island. His house once stood along No 3. Coleman Street. It was demolished in 1965 and replaced by the present-day Peninsula Hotel.25 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Syed Alwi Road
Syed Alwi Road was originally called Syed Allie Road after the Arab merchant Syed Allie Bin Mohamed Al Junied. Syed Allie gave back to the community generously by donating land for community purposes and building large wells.26 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Pickering Street
Originally Macao Street and Upper Macao Street, and the site of the original Chinese Protectorate,27 this road in the downtown core of Singapore's central region, was renamed to honour the contributions of William Alexander Pickering who, as the head of the Chinese Protectorate, helped clamp down on coolie abuse and rein in Chinese secret societies.28 He could speak Mandarin and four Chinese dialects, winning the hearts of members of the Chinese community.29 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
North Bridge Road
One of the earliest and longest roads in Singapore, North Bridge Road was named as such as it lies north to Elgin Bridge which spans the Singapore River. Its sister road, South Bridge, was part of Sir Stamford Raffles' 1822 Town Plan. Both were built by convicts.30 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Mosque Street
Mosque Street, a one-way street in Chinatown, was named as such due to the presence of Jamae Mosque which was built between 1830 and 1835 by Chulia Muslims. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-lien-wen-sze/story,"Whenever Dr Lien Wen Sze goes to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), she is armed with a mind full of knowledge, and her friends and family in tow. The volunteer Mandarin Guide is on a mission to get more people to visit Singapore's museums, beginning from the one she has been conducting tours in for the last two years.
â€œI find this museum so wonderful,â€ says the 69-year-old retiree about the ACM. â€œI come here once a week with different groups of friends. I take them around, and invite them for tea, of course!â€
Wen Sze's love affair with ACM began after retiring as a food scientist at multinational food-and-beverage corporation Nestle. Not contented with just reading for pleasure, the bibliophile signed up to be a museum docent after chancing upon an open call for volunteers.
â€œBeing a Singaporean, I feel the need to be more aware of our surrounding countries,â€ she says. â€œComing to the Asian Civilisations Museum gives me opportunities to learn with a focus, and a chance to share my knowledge.â€
Wen Sze was familiar with Chinese history. After all, she grew up the daughter of Chinese literary pioneer and Nanyang Siang Pau editor-in-chief, Lien Shih Sheng. In contrast, she knew very little about the histories and cultures of the rest of Asia until she started volunteering. From giving regular Mandarin tours of the ACM's permanent collection as well as past special exhibitions, such as Cities & Kings: Ancient Treasures from Myanmar and Christianity in Asia: Sacred Art and Visual Splendour, Wen Sze has come to understand the commonalities that bind this region. A recent discovery she made is how many capitals of Southeast Asiaâ€”Bangkok, Singapore, Jakarta, and Yangonâ€”are located near the sea as this allowed their inhabitants to trade with others easily.
Meticulous preparation
Every new exhibition at ACM gives Wen Sze the perfect excuse to buy books. This kickstarted a meticulous process of highlighting and footnoting, her method of identifying the building blocks for her historical tours. Wen Sze views history as a backdrop to our present. She believes the historical backdrop will help museum visitors understand the exhibited artefacts. For instance, visitors to the Joseon Korea: Court Treasures and City Life exhibition may be puzzled about why many of these artefacts from Korea are filled with Chinese characters. She explains to them that this is because the kingdom encouraged the spread of Chinese Confucian ideals and doctrines.
â€œIf I just learn the artefacts without knowing the history, I'm not a good docent,â€ she says. â€œAnybody can just read the panel texts; I feel I need to fill in and make the connections.â€
Such an analytical take on heritage stems from Wen Sze having a PhD in Chemistry and a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration. Working as a food scientist has also taught her to research in a methodical manner, and to be aware of histories and different cultures. Wen Sze has also contributed to food science education and training, having taught in universities in both Singapore and China. â€œEven when you develop a food product for a nation, you have to understand its culture,â€ she explains.
Despite having switched her devotion in life from science to heritage, Wen Sze says it has not only been easy but also a good change in lifestyle pace. Unlike the rapid changes in science and technology that required her to keep up with the latest developments, she enjoys how heritage moves slower as it is a â€œprecipitation of cultureâ€. She adds with a laugh, â€œIt won't go away. You can just add on and add on, so it is more rewarding especially for older people as we can't run that fast now.â€
In fact, this was hardly the case when I went on a tour led by Wen Sze. The bespectacled lady with a short crop of hair zipped through the exhibition of over 150 artefacts from South Korea's national museums, hardly breaking a sweat. Even though she is a Mandarin Guide, Wen Sze also gamely added English translations when some of her visitors asked for it. And, after walking and speaking for more than an hour, she was still ever ready to answer questions from visitors.
Beyond the fascinating artefacts in the museum, it is clear that Wen Sze is also energised by the interactions with visitors on her tours. One of her most memorable experiences was taking the Literature Nobel laureate Mo Yan on a private tour of ACM when he was in town. Despite it not being his first time, the Chinese novelist praised her for proving to him how good the museum's collection was.
â€œWe have many good museums, and there are so many treasures in them,â€ says Wen Sze. â€œThat is why we must do our part to let visiting museums become a national pastime!â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-ma-swan-hoo/story,"Dr Ma Swan Hoo is determined to make Singapore's past a beacon for the future. She is paving the way by leading tours at several museums every weekend, often on both Saturday and Sunday. That is not all. Swan Hoo is a docent leader and mentor to fellow volunteers. She is also often sought after for her insights on making Singapore's heritage relevant to the national interest. She does all this while holding a day job as a medical doctor, currently involved in research on cosmetics.
Becoming a docent
Swan Hoo's decision to become a docent stemmed from a love for history. â€œI married a man who was very much interested in history and whenever we travelled, we would spend a lot of time visiting museums,â€ recalled Swan Hoo. These museum visits with her husband, Dr Balaji Sadasivan, helped her to appreciate the role played by good docents.
â€œReading the captions and panel texts alone can be very tedious and one might be exhausted before getting a good grasp of the exhibition. A guided tour helps one focus on what is interesting, and what the narrative of the exhibition is,â€ observed Swan Hoo.
Thus, in 2001, she completed docent training at the Singapore History Museum (now called the National Museum of Singapore). Since then, she has guided visitors at The Peranakan Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, National Museum of Singapore, Indian Heritage Centre, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, Singapore Art Museum, and the National Gallery Singapore. She keeps herself up to speed by attending the latest training sessions at these institutions.
Shaping societal values
Swan Hoo believes that understanding the past helps to shape society's attitudes in the present and future. For example, knowing that early Singapore was built on the backs of immigrants goes some way in persuading Singaporeans to be open to present-day immigrants. She also points to the communal tension and racial riots in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s as events that remind us of the value of the peace and stability we have in today's Singapore.
â€œAlthough we've had a relatively short history, we did face a lot of challenges, and, fortunately, we had very capable leaders who were able to bring us out of these difficult times to where we are today,â€ says Swan Hoo. â€œIt is important that we continue to progress and achieve the sort of society we are in now. I really feel we shouldn't take things for granted.â€
Swan Hoo's compassion for people has led to deeds that go beyond typical museum volunteerism. For instance, she has bought the artworks of prison inmates and donated them back to their families. She has travelled with the Singapore International Foundation to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, to teach English at eight secondary schools there.
Leading museum volunteers
In 2004, Swan Hoo helped to set up Museum Volunteers (MV), a group consisting of working professionals who guide visitors during weekends and public holidays. She was its President from 2011 to 2014.
During this period, she worked closely with the volunteers to achieve the nearly impossible task of keeping the no-show of docents close to zero. What helped? Swan Hoo introduced an electronic scheduling system which let docents select their guiding slots and be responsible for finding their own replacement if they were unable to turn up. Having set up the system, she and her committee went a step further to mobilise, persuade and teach fellow docents to use the system.
â€œWe don't want our reputation as a museum or as a country to be tarnished just because the docent didn't show up,â€ says Swan Hoo. â€œAs far as visitors are concerned, they would not know that there is a last-minute cancellation of the tour, and they may have planned their day's programmes around attending the tour. Imagine how the front-desk will be in a fix having to handle angry visitors. So, we must turn up.â€
Sharing her vision
Swan Hoo has many ideas that would make museums a bigger part of people's lives. For instance, she would love to involve more senior citizens in guiding museum tours for community groups. Singapore's aging population lends itself nicely to this. â€œSenior citizens,â€ she says, â€œmight be able to relate to a lot of the events that happened in the past which younger guides might not be familiar with.â€
She envisions them doing soapbox tours. â€œWe can keep our senior citizens actively engaged. They will feel that they are contributing to Singapore, and it also gives them a good reason to get out of the house, travel to the museum, get to know people, and get to learn about history or art or artefacts,â€ Swan Hoo says.
Another dream of hers is that all schools have professionally-trained museum educators. She would also love to see museums become alternative classrooms. â€œI feel that our museums should be places where our students can learn; not just go once, but make repeat visits. There are so many things they can learn at the museums,â€ concludes Swan Hoo.
When opportunities arise, Swan Hoo willingly shares such ideas. The Indian Heritage Centre benefits immensely from Swan Hoo's visionary outlook â€“ she serves on its advisory board. She also regularly participates in dialogue sessions aimed at nation building, such as the Our Singapore Conversation and NHB's Heritage Plan dialogues. She hopes her ideas for museums will come to fruition soon so that history will indeed be a beacon for our nation's future.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-belinda-mock/story,"Visitors to a museum would expect to be taken into the depths of history. But, as Belinda Mock sees it, Singapore's past is very much breathing and alive.
At a tour of the Singapore History Gallery, the veteran docent does not shy from a personal script. Her father, like many first-generation Singaporeans, arrived by boat while escaping the Sino-Japanese war in China, Belinda shares.
That was why Japanese soldiers thought the local Chinese were anti-Japanese supporters during World War II in Singapore, she adds. They targeted Chinese males at Operation Sook Ching, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
â€œI want visitors to realise that I'm not just presenting something that I read or heard about. My ancestors were part of Singapore's history. I am the end product of their experiences,â€ she explained.
Belinda loves talking about the city-state's rise as a bustling metropolis. These are the final sections of the gallery, located at the National Museum of Singapore. â€œMany visitors are in awe of how Singapore is peaceful, multiracial, and successful even though it is a small country,â€ she said.
She gives credit to the government for being able to change public perceptions when needed. For instance, there were student riots when the British first introduced national service in the 1950s. So, Singapore leaders took time to broach the subject after the country became independent, Belinda said. They eventually made national service compulsory in 1967.
There were attractive incentives for starting a military careerâ€”enough to convince Belinda, then a fresh jobseeker, to sign up. She became an officer with the Republic of Singapore Air Force.
â€œVisitors will look at me and think: â€˜Wow, you were an officer?' In the old days, people thought that the army was not a respectable way to make a living. Now, Singaporeans have grown to respect the military forces.â€
â€œIt's my personal way of explaining that Singapore is successful because people have opportunities to do anything that they set their minds to,â€ Belinda reflected.
A passion out of work
Today, Belinda does marketing for an IT company. She leads two tours every Saturday, at heritage institutions including the National Museum of Singapore, Former Ford Factory, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, and Asian Civilisations Museum. Sunday is her family day.
This has been the arrangement since 2004, when she started training as a docent with Museum Volunteers. The group is made up of around 200 English-speaking guides. Most of the members are Singaporeans holding full-time jobs, who share a passion for heritage, culture and the arts.
â€œAs a museum docent, you get to learn about artefacts from the experts, before doing your own research for tours. For blockbuster exhibitions, an overseas curator may even come to Singapore to take us around,â€ Belinda said.
At times, members organise trips to exhibitions' countries of origin. Notably, blockbusters are a chance for docents to get to know each other better and work as a team. â€œAfter an hour of guiding, we would probably lose our voices and go for afternoon tea or a drink,â€ Belinda said. The group also holds a traditional â€œexhibition sending offâ€ potluck.
In 2014, Belinda took a break from work. She spent a very busy year as the President of Museum Volunteers before returning to the workplace.
Preparation for any exhibition is a lengthy process. After doing research, Belinda comes up with a detailed tour paper with varying stops, depending on the age range of visitors.
â€œTo keep dementia away, people always recommend playing mahjong. I'd say volunteer as a docent. Every few months, a fresh exhibition forces you to learn something new. It keeps your mind moving,â€ she shared.
Museum culture
The rise in museum visitorship is encouraging for docents, Belinda said. When she first started, there were occasions where her tours had no takers. Now, she typically addresses a group of between 10 and 20 people on a Saturday.
â€œAs Singapore develops and aspires to become a first-world nation, culture plays a large part. It is cool to be seen visiting museums. People like watching musicals and plays,â€ Belinda said. â€œThese activities have become part and parcel of life, more so than the previous generation. I am very fortunate to be able to witness this change.â€
Belinda inspired two of her colleagues at work to join the Museum Volunteers, and they are now actively guiding at the National Museum of Singapore. Beyond guiding, Belinda goes the extra mile by lingering after tours to talk to visitors. Some tourists ask her for food recommendations. Others need her help with directions, or recommendations for attractions to visit.
Belinda's advice for heritage lovers? â€œTry being a docent, especially if you love to share your experiences with others,â€ she said. â€œAt the end of the day, you can inspire people through the stories that you tell.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-tan-boon-piang/story,"â€œWhen you are fast becoming a part of history, you better know more about history,â€ says volunteer docent Tan Boon Piang with a laugh. Jokes aside, this is why the 61-year-old decided to become a history buff some two decades ago.
He attributes his earlier lack of interest in history to not being inspired enough as a student at Catholic High School in the early 1970s. Plus, he was taught Southeast Asian history in Mandarin, and that made studying for the examinations extra tough. â€œImagine the Indian and Thai names translated into Chinese! Oh my, what a mouthful!â€ he exclaims.
When Boon Piang finally put his heart into studying history at the age of 40, he found out that few institutions would entertain a middle-aged man who just wanted to learn for the sake of learning. The exceptions were the Singapore Hainan Hwee Kuan, where he took a two-year course on China's history, and the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM).
In 2006, while still working in the banking industry, Boon Piang answered the museum's call for volunteers to guide a special exhibition, On the Nalanda Trail: Buddhism In India, China and Southeast Asia. This led him to be invited three years later to join the museum's then newly-set up docent group. He could not have been happier to be given the opportunity to attend training courses by curators and academics. â€œNowhere else would I get to study history for free!â€ Today, besides the ACM, the retiree also gives Mandarin tours at the Peranakan Museum, and the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.
As the museums hold special exhibitions periodically, the delightful talks and training sessions never end for Boon Piang. They also expose him to topics he had not anticipated enjoying as much as he did.
Pop culture links
Before ACM's Joseon Korea: Court Treasures and City Life exhibition, he had no inkling of Korean history, nor did he give his wife's favourite Korean dramas a chance. But he ended up looking at these to find connections between history and pop culture when he had to do research for the exhibition. For example, he found a book about the popular Korean television series Jewel in the Palace, which was based on the Joseon Dynasty.
On his tours, Boon Piang brought along a Korean banknote and eagerly pointed out to visitors that the same king featured in the museum's exhibition also appears on the banknote. This certainly worked with his wife who turned up for one of his exhibition tours.
â€œYou can't go on and on about the artefacts,â€ he explains. â€œYou have to tell them that â€˜this was used by that character in the drama' to attract their attention.â€
Supportive family
Both his son and wife have been supportive of his interest, but it has usually only been in the form of moral support.
Their daughter, on the other hand, has been to all of Boon Piang's rehearsals. It was early on during such prep sessions that she pointed out his distracting mannerisms. For instance, she pointed out that she counted him saying â€œokayâ€ 150 times in a single tour. She also advised him to condense the information he shared during a tour. â€œWe are very close, so she dares to be brutally honest with me,â€ he says. Thanks to his volunteering, the father and daughter have had many opportunities to bond at the museum.
But, now that she has grown up, the 26-year-old is not interested in tagging along for overseas trips with her dad. For instance, inspired by the Joseon exhibition, Boon Piang planned a trip to Korea. â€œMy daughter said, â€˜I don't want to go Korea with old people! Koreaâ€¦ must go with young people!'â€ He is still amused by her audacity.
Fortunately, Boon Piang has made some very good friends with the other museum volunteers. They often travel together, inspired by the exhibitions they work on. They have even initiated a project to translate ACM's permanent exhibitions into Mandarin guide books. They have completed their third book, an effort which they laboured over for about six months.
Boon Piang recalls when an ex-colleague bumped into him at the museum and was curious why he would do tours for free. â€œMany people in Singapore wouldn't understand,â€ he says. The answer for Boon Piang is simple: his newfound love for history, and the camaraderie he has forged with other like-minded volunteers.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-patricia-welch/story,"Once a teacher, always a teacherâ€”the phrase resonates with Patricia Welch. Formerly a lecturer of Chinese history and religion at Boston University, she had left the job for a series of marketing roles.
Decades later and miles across the world, Patricia has found a way back to the profession. Now, she spends most of her time voluntarily training docents, who lead tours at nine museums and cultural institutions around Singapore.
â€œAlthough I left academia to work in the private sector, I always knew I wanted to return to that field. I believe in community service, but felt it was also important to use the skills and knowledge that I had acquired in the field of Asian art,â€ Patricia said.
â€œBeing a volunteer docentâ€”and given my education and experience, a trainer of docentsâ€”is, for me, the perfect combination,â€ she added.
Born in Wisconsin and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Patricia was aged 18 and a pre-medical student when she discovered a love for Asian history. â€œI have no idea what it was. Something just hit me right away, and I fell in love,â€ she said.
Patricia switched majors to Asian Studies at Boston University, where she also attained her Master's Degree before continuing Chinese Studies at the University of Oslo, Norway.
In the late 1980s, she relocated to Bangkok, and signed up as a volunteer guide at its National Museum. When Patricia moved to Singapore in 1994, she was on the lookout for similar opportunities.
That was when she discovered Friends of the Museums (FOM), a non-profit organisation with nearly 2,000 members. The organisation provides financial support and weekday guiding services to museums and cultural institutions.
â€œAlthough I was working full-time, Friends offered free Monday Morning lectures and a large array of other activities, including study groups and tours, so I joined,â€ she said.
From docent to trainer
She has not looked back. Besides joining FOM, Patricia also became a member of the Museum Volunteers, a community of English-speaking guides who give tours on the weekends. Now that she is retired from full-time employment, she guides for both FOM and the Museum Volunteers.
â€œMore than half of my friends in Singapore are fellow volunteers because that's where we met! Volunteering is a great way to meet like-minded people,â€ Patricia shared.
Most docents giving tours on weekdays are expatriates like Patricia. â€œSo, don't be surprised if you visit, say the Indian Heritage Centre, and find your guide a German or Brazilian,â€ she said.
Guiding at the Asian Civilisations Museum is among her favourite experiences. Visitors are given a glimpse of Singapore as an â€œancient emporiaâ€ for the trading of goods. For instance, ivory from Africa passed through the city-state before being carved by the Chinese, Patricia explained.
â€œThere are many stories that should be shared. Guiding is a pure joy, to be able to share knowledge and light that spark of interest in visitors,â€ she said. â€œIt's a wonderful feeling when they come back and ask, â€˜Where should I go next?'â€
In 2015, she became involved in the training of FOM docents at institutions such as the Asian Civilisations Museum, Peranakan Museum, and Singapore Art Museum. Patricia also served on the FOM Council and was FOM's webmaster for three years.
In 2016, Patricia was appointed Co-head of Overall Docent Training. She spends most of her time structuring and coordinating preparatory programmes which can be completed in 8 to 24 weeks.
â€œWhen we review applicants, we look for people who like being with people, who are keen to learn and make learning fun. We assume no prior knowledge whatsoever, which is why we have a large number of non-Singaporeans who also volunteer for our programmes,â€ Patricia said.
â€œDon't hesitate. As long as you have intellectual curiosity, being a volunteer docent or guide is very fulfilling.â€
On top of guiding and training docents, Patricia also leads study tours to China for FOM.
Inspiring others
Volunteering is a family affair in the Welch household. Patricia's husband volunteers in his areas of expertise, primarily sitting on academic advisories.
Both her daughters have careers in the field of social work. One is a psychologist working primarily with young people. The second works with paperless refugees in Europe. They are also active volunteers in their free time, working with displaced and special-needs individuals, Patricia shared.
The small moments of guiding are close to her heart. Once, Patricia had a seven-year-old visitor on a tour around the Asian Civilisations Museum.
â€œI chose to speak to the girl, rather than leave her out. I told her that being interested in history requires some detective work. By looking at a statue, you can figure out what people wore, did and thought about life,â€ she said.
â€œI was using the words 'archaeology' and 'archaeologist' a lot,â€ Patricia added. â€œAt the end of the tour, she told her mother that she wanted to become an archaeologist. It's a moment that I'll always remember.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-may-hui/story,"May Hui's life is driven by a simple principle â€“ to make life better for others. She does this through volunteer work that benefits a range of Singaporeans, from children and senior citizens to people with disabilities and prison inmates. Nowadays, most of her time goes into volunteering with the Singapore After-Care Association (SACA)â€”where she mentors prison inmates who are about to be released, so that they can re-integrate into societyâ€”and, as a docent with heritage institutions such as the Indian Heritage Centre, and the Malay Heritage Centre.
On the face of it, being a prison volunteer does not seem to have anything in common with being a museum guide, but May sees it differently. To her, both have to do with unlocking the prisons of the mind.
Whether it is inmates wanting to lead meaningful lives as free citizens or the man-on-the-street entering a museum to settle a doubt he has about a historical event, the common thread is the need to free the mind from the shackles of bias and misinformation.
â€œWe just keep in our shells. We don't know things until somebody unlocks them, and you go exploring on your own,â€ says May.
Inspiring stories
May takes pains to ensure that visitors get the most out of a museum trip. â€œThere are so many things people can do in an hour. But, if they choose to step into a museum, it is my responsibility to offer them a memorable experience. So, I think accuracy of fact, being very comprehensive, engaging them, and bringing artefacts to life are important,â€ she says.
Having served over a decade as a prison volunteer, May decided to add being a museum guide to her list of volunteer activities. She wanted to balance the sad stories she hears from inmates with stories of hope from Singapore's history.
Conversations with prison inmates tend to revolve around questions about their personal history including what made them commit a crime and so on, says May. Being a docent, she feels, would put her in touch with the inspiring stories of Singapore's forefathers who â€œcame here with nothing and worked very hardâ€. It would also give her a wellspring of anecdotes to use when encouraging others, be they in prison cells or outside seeking a sense of their roots.
So, when May learnt that docents were being recruited for the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall (SYSNMH), she was thrilled. She enrolled in the docent-training programme run by the Friends of the Museum (FOM). â€œI thought, well, this is a great chance to get to know the works of this great man, and what better way than to attend a training programme.â€
In her own words
The aspects May likes about being a docent are that it enables her to internalise historical information, and share it with museum visitors in her own words. â€œAlthough a picture paints a thousand words, it is the docent who brings depth to life,â€ says May.
Using as an example the bust of Zubir Said on display at the Malay Heritage Centre, May explains that a docent can depict his journey in life by piecing together biographical details of the historical figure.
May points out that without someone fleshing out the details of Zubir's lifeâ€”how he left Indonesia for Singapore without his father's permission so that he could fulfil his dream of becoming a musician, how from a self-taught musician he became a composer with Cathay-Keris Studio, and how he declined payment for writing the music and lyrics of the national anthem Majulah Singapura  because the honour of doing it was sufficient reward for himâ€”one would see the sculpture, but miss the man.
â€œSo the â€˜picture' here is Zubir Said, but I want to tell my story of how he became a good composer, and how we have a street named after him â€”Zubir Said Drive â€” because he had the drive. It is not Zubir Said Road or Zubir Said Street,â€ quips May, exercising a little poetic license to inject a bit of fun into history.
Docents are essentially the character of a museum in human form. Aware of the gravity of her responsibility in being the â€œfaceâ€ of the cultural institutions she guides at, May continuously updates the information she shares with the public. She has 20 files into which she slots newspaper clippings and other bits of information she comes across pertaining to the artefacts she speaks about during her tours.
â€œYou must like to talk to people and that's no problem with me,â€ says May, adding that her experience as a prison volunteer has sharpened her ability to connect with people. Whether they are corporate clients or children, â€œyou must be able to go to their levelâ€.
Beyond the museum
It is this talent for reaching out to people that puts a shine on May's work as a docent. During one of her tours at the Malay Heritage Centre, May overheard a couple of the visitors saying they used to live at the Joo Chiat area in Singapore. After the tour, May told them that Zubir Said used to live there as well. After Zubir retired from Cathay-Keris Studio in 1964, he spent his time teaching music at his home in Joo Chiat Place.
â€œThey were so excited and said, â€˜I'm going back to look for it.' The trip to the museum should not end here. They should be able to do something with the information they have been passed,â€ says May. â€œThey should explore further, especially during school holidays when they bring their kids along. So, it's a responsibility that I have passed to parents â€” to go and explore the neighbourhood with their children.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Ho-Kwen-Khee-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"â€œI asked my students â€“â€“ if they had a time machine, where would they like to go?â€
Ho Kwen Khee, a volunteer guide at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall (SYSNMH), is also a full-time Chinese tutor by profession.
â€œI was hoping some kids would choose to visit the past â€“â€“ our history is so colourful and exciting. Sadly, all my students chose to travel to the future. Looks like I am the only one who wants to go back to the Qing dynasty!â€ laughs Kwen Khee.
Her love affair with history dates back to her childhood. Thinking back, she attributes this passion to her history teacher in secondary school.
â€œShe'll talk history for two straight periods without looking at the book. I remember thinking to myself, Wow, she knows everything by heart. It was really admirable and inspiring,â€ she recalls with a smile. Kwen Khee seems to have imbued her own storytelling with the same qualities.
Life-long history lessons
Kwen Khee's relationship with SYSNMH began quite by chance, with an invitation to a friend's tour six years ago. â€œI fell in love with the place,â€ she sighs fondly. â€œIt is small and humble, but its stories are endless and fascinating.â€
â€œI wish more Singaporeans knew their history. This particular history is not (yet) in our textbooks; people do not realise the importance of Dr Sun Yat Sen in our own Singapore story,â€ says Kwen Khee about the exhibits.
Indeed, many Singaporeans do not know of Dr Sun's revolutionary ideas and crucial role in Singapore's intellectual development. According to Kwen Khee, even tourists from Taiwan and China have been surprised by what they learned at SYSNMH.
â€œThey are always very grateful to learn. In China especially, their story is told very differently back home,â€ Kwen Khee explains. â€œThis part of history is missing in the Chinese narrative. Some Chinese tourists even told me â€“â€“ gosh, we do not know our own history!â€
A storyteller at heart
A gentle and unassuming individual, Kwen Khee says she is not like other docents. Shyly, she confides that she has had a lifelong fear of public speaking. This is why she teaches private tuition instead of in public schools, she adds. One-to-one sessions with students are not as daunting as facing a whole crowd.
Why sign up to be a docent, then, and have to speak to large tour groups all the time? â€œSharing stories is very rewarding. I like to tell stories,â€ she explains.
Kwen Khee is driven by her passion to educate, and pass important knowledge on to others. Besides, being a docent has helped her to overcome her phobia, she adds. Today, public speaking is no longer as difficult for her as it used to be.
â€œI use my own success story to encourage others who are afraid of public speaking too,â€ Kwen Khee shares candidly. â€œI tell them, just try. It might just help you get over your fears.â€
Teachers' knowhow helps
At SYSNMH, there is no one primary or main demographic. Visitors range from primary school students to tourists from all over the world, or senior citizens from various Voluntary Welfare Organisations.
Being a teacher, Kwen Khee is able to sensitively codeswitch and pitch appropriately to her crowd. As her students range from primary school all the way to junior college, she is used to varying her use of language â€“â€“ speaking more clearly and simply to the little ones, and allowing more complexity and nuance to the older ones.
Furthermore, teaching has made Ms Ho very good at reading her audience; she is very sensitive to their needs and reactions. â€œIt's all in the eyes,â€ she chuckles. â€œFrom their eyes you can tell who is confused, who is engaged, who is dreaming!â€
All these crucial skills allow Kwen Khee to simplify or complicate her language and content wherever needed. This helps her to tailor her speech to many diverse groups of listeners, keeping them happy and interested throughout the tour.
Growing as a docent
Becoming a tour guide at SYSNMH was not easy for Kwen Khee. â€œWe did our own independent research, and wrote our own 5,000-word script,â€ she says.
She has been attached exclusively to the museum since she began giving tours in 2013. Selfless and dedicated, Kwen Khee goes above and beyond her tour guide duties. She also assists the memorial hall in arranging and scheduling special tours, as well as manages larger crowds by organising them into smaller groups before tours begin. This way, Kwen Khee helps to ensure that everything runs without a hitch.
It is clear to see that Kwen Khee's passion and dedication to sharing knowledge permeates her tours. Truly, SYSNMH visitors are all the better for it!

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-jo-wright/story,"Jo Wright can turn an ordinary stone into an object of wonder just by telling you a story about it. She is a docent at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), where her favourite artefact is a bezoar stone. The dull grey mass about the size of a ping-pong ball does not look like much, until Jo starts talking about it.
You can get this information about bozoar stones online or from books. But, what Jo does is take points of history and weave them into a narrative based on fact and folklore. That way, her stories enthuse museum visitors enough to make them want to read up more by themselves.
â€œWe retell stories in this museum. We do story-led tours where the artifact is the central part,â€ she says. â€œI call it joining the dots. We uncover all the interesting stories about different artefacts, and it's by pulling it all together that you really get people to look closely.â€
Loved stories from young
As a young girl growing up near Oxford in the United Kingdom, Jo would go to the library every week. â€œMyths and legends from around the world was my staple reading. I'd go home and read voraciously, and the next week I'd swap them for new books. I was addicted to stories from a very early age,â€ she says.
Jo earned a degree in mechanical engineering in the UK where she worked in the avionics sector for 20 years. She came to Singapore in 2005 after her husband got a job here. She found out about the Friends of the Museum (FOM), a non-profit organisation made up of volunteers who dedicate their time to being guides in Singapore's museums and heritage institutions. FOM complements the efforts of the National Heritage Board in sharing knowledge about Asian history, culture, and art with the community. Jo joined FOM's docent training programme because training to be a guide in museums was a good way to learn about the history and culture of Singapore and, more broadly, Asia. It also enabled her to apply her skills in training other people, which was part of her job in the avionics industry back in the UK.
â€œVolunteering just gives you an opportunity to try different things, and to find those hidden secrets within yourself that you had absolutely no idea were there. And, I think that's quite magical,â€ says Jo. One of the things she discovered was how the curiosity that led her into engineering lent itself nicely to her role as a pedlar of cultural knowledge.
â€œHaving an engineering background is fantastic training because I look at things and think, â€˜How does that work? Why is it like that?'.â€ Visitors who join her tours benefit from her enquiring spirit. She has guided over 8,000 people in some 600 tours, which have included everybody from six-year-olds and teenagers to government ministers.
Engaging with the audience

She also trains other docents and her tip to them is: â€œInhale the artefacts and find something that really resonates with you.â€ The power to be engaging has a lot to do with finding something in an audience to engage with. Jo has led tours in which teenagers who â€œstood there truculent, shufflingâ€ in the beginning, ended up interested because she was able to take elements of an age-old object and connect them with things that appeal to teenagers today.
Once, she made a bunch of secondary school students curious about a Chinese tomb dug up 3,000 years ago, by telling them that their mobile phones had something in common with a coffin in it â€“ plastic. The coat of lacquer on the coffin, which kept it brilliantly preserved, she told them, was actually a natural form of plastic derived from the sap of the Toxicodendron vernicifluum, known more commonly as the Chinese lacquer tree.
Another time, she guided tertiary students who were doing courses in designing video games. Their teachers had sent them to ACM to get ideas and they did not know where to start. She asked them to think of themselves as storytellers as a way to approach designing games; then she sparked off their imagination with a tour of mythical creatures.
â€œâ€˜Oh, we get it!' they said. I told them, â€˜All you're doing is continuing a tradition that has been around for thousands of years; it's in a different format, it's in a different material, but it's still storytelling',â€ Jo recounted.
Stories are very powerful. They are deep in our mass memory,â€ she adds. In urban cities like Singapore, where things change very fast, having an abiding sense of one's heritage is important. Many people tell her that the place they grew up in, or the school they went to, no longer exists.
â€œIt is easy to become rootless when that happens,â€ says Jo, underscoring the importance of museums like ACM in forging a sense of belonging. She has been a guide there for over eight years. â€œI feel much a part of the fabric of this building,â€ she says.
Sometimes, when the children she guides ask her about her work as a docent, she explains that she is a volunteer and, hence, does not earn a salary from being a guide. They say, â€œWah! Why you do this?â€ In reply she tells them, â€œIf I see you bringing back your mum and dad, then that would be a fantastic reward for me.â€

Bezoar stones
Bezoars are solidified lumps of undigested hair or vegetable matter found in the gastrointestinal organs of humans and animals. Today, the presence of a bezoar in the human or animal gut would be considered a medical problem (Eng and Kay 776) (Barroso 193). This was not the case in ancient times. Bezoars, especially those from ruminants like goats, were considered antidotes to poison. This made them popular among royalty and the wealthy, who were wary of being poisoned by their enemies (Barroso 82). They were used as medicines in Persia as early as the 8th century and reached European shores around the 11th century (Barroso, 80; Eng and Kay, 776). As word about their medicinal and magical properties spread throughout medieval Europe, demand for them increased. By 1700, Jesuit monks in the Portuguese colony of Goa were producing artificial bezoars to make up for the short supply of real ones (Alden 543; National Heritage Board 31).

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-lionel-louis/story,"Since 2015, Lionel Louis has served as the President of Museum Volunteers, a group of 200 men and women who lead free tours of the museums on weekends. Folks are often surprised when they learn he is in charge of the group. After all, his boyish features and wide-eyed enthusiasm make him appear even younger than his 32 years.
But, do not mistake his youth for inexperience. He is a dedicated specialist in Singaporean history, constantly upgrading his knowledge about our shared heritage.
â€œA docent's training spans between three to four months,â€ he explains. â€œThere are mock tours to do and research papers to write. And, once you start guiding, the learning doesn't stop. Guests tell you new information, and curators give you new angles to talk about. Your tour is always evolving and changing.â€
He began guiding at the National Museum four years ago, telling visitors stories about its most prized exhibits, such as the Singapore Stone and the Revere Bell. One of his favourite items on display is John Turnbull Johnson's 1851 oil painting of the Padang, titled The Esplanade at Scandal Point. He enjoys pointing out all the easily missed details on the canvas, such as the presence of Orang Laut and Arab traders, as well as the view of the Armenian Church,St Andrew's Church and Government House (now known as the Arts House).
Beyond textbooks
He also takes great pleasure in revealing secrets of the past that were not taught in school. For instance, history textbooks often neglect to mention that Colonel William Farquhar had two wives: one in Scotland and another in Malacca. The punchline to this anecdote is that one of his descendants, via his Malaccan wife Nonio Clement, is the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Towards the end of his tour of the History Gallery, he begins sharing tales about independent Singapore. â€œThere's a lot of personal stories I can tell people,â€ he says. â€œLike, there's the Stop at Two poster. I like to tell guests that we're a young nation, and our policymakers may make mistakes. We're still learning from them.â€
His favourite bit of the tour, however, is the conclusion, when the guests give him a round of applause. â€œPeople say, â€˜I never knew history could be so interesting.' That's when I know I've done a good job. I once started a tour, and an elderly man said, â€˜You look too young to be a docent. Are you sure you'll do a good job?' And, after the tour, he said, â€˜I'll give you a ten out of ten.'â€
Occasionally, Lionel has been involved in slightly more unusual tours. For instance, as part of the Singapore Heritage Festival 2016, he was trained by a theatre company to lead dramatised tours. He ended up playing three different roles: a 14th century villager, an early 20th century Chettiar and the Chettiar's son who became a civil servant.  His fellow guides played roles like black and white amahs, rickshaw pullers and Japanese soldiers. â€œIt was very draining, but also very fun,â€ he says.
Mind you, not all volunteers need to be such dynamic storytellers. He points out the many other roles one can play at the museums, such as welcoming visitors as a host, or ensuring that they keep to the rules in the exhibition space as a gallery sitter.
Planning ahead
As the President of Museum Volunteers, Lionel has many responsibilities besides guiding. Together with a committee of 14 other people, he ensures that the guides are properly scheduled, trains new volunteers, organises Learning Days and collects feedback for the museums.
He is also attempting to create better documentation and a structured long-term strategy for his group, so that they can remain relevant in these changing times. But, planning ahead can be difficult, since the museums themselves are constantly changing and seeking new directions.
He experienced one such change when the Indian Heritage Centre opened in 2015. In spite of being Indian himself, he soon realised he had a lot to learn as a volunteer. â€œI was born into a Catholic family, then I converted to Buddhism. I had no idea about all the Hindu gods and their different forms. Then, I learned about all the different religions in the Indian community, like Parsism and Jainism, and about the independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose, and Tamil Murasu founder G Sarangapany.â€
Surprisingly, the artefact that moves him the most is not a religious statue or a war relic. It is a Tamil language typewriter, capable of printing the 200-plus combinations of characters used in the script. The object reminds him of his own Tamil lessons as a schoolboy in the 1990s. Back then, he did not think much of the fact that Tamil fonts were available on the computer. But, he now realises that this was only possible because people who loved the language invented new ways to bring it into the 20th and 21st centuries.
He is grateful not only to the museum but also to the people who donated the typewriter: the family of the late Tamil poet Viswanatha Ikkuvanam Iyer. Their generosity has enabled him to gain a new appreciation for his heritage.
â€œMuseums play a very important role in society because they're a visual documentation of people and stories,â€ he says. â€œIt's important to document your own stories, so that museums can share them with people.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-long-chin-peng/story,"When she was a young woman, Long Chin Peng had to quit her job as a Chinese teacher. Being a mother of four children, of whom two had special needs, meant she had to spend endless hours feeding them with special bottles, ferrying them to doctors, dentists and speech therapists, and worrying while they recovered from surgeries. She felt that there was absolutely no way she could balance that kind of stress with a full-time job.
Soon enough, her kids grew older and more independent. They began urging her to get out of the house and pick up new hobbies. She still remembers their encouraging words: â€œMummy, you should go and do something you like.â€
By coincidence, the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) had just begun a recruitment drive for volunteer Mandarin guides. She found out about it from an advertisement in the LianheZaobao, while she was eating dim sum with friends at Chinatown's Yum Cha Restaurant. All three of them signed up, but only she was called back for an interview.
That was back in 2003. Today, the 49-year-old Chin Peng is one of the most active and respected volunteer guides among the Mandarin Docents. She leads tours not only at the ACM, but also at the National Museum of Singapore, the Peranakan Museum, the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, the Malay Heritage Centre, and the Indian Heritage Centre.
The Peranakan Museum is especially dear to her heart as her aunt is a Nyonya, and Chin Peng did her thesis at Peking University on Peranakan culture. As a member of the Museum Volunteers group at the Peranakan Museum, she guides visitors in Mandarin as well as in English.
On top of all this, Chin Peng also volunteers at institutions that are not operated by the National Heritage Board. These include the National Gallery, the Art Science Museum, the National Library, Nanyang Technological University's Chinese Heritage Centre, the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations, the Kong Chow Wui Koon, the Istana, and the newly-opened Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre. In short, she has gone from being a full-time mother to a full-time museum volunteer.
Patriotic duty
What drives Chin Peng to do so much of this work? In part, it is a sense of patriotic duty. â€œI try and contribute back to society,â€ she says. â€œI love my country. I love my country's history, so I want to carry it onwards.â€ Whatever exhibition she is in, whether it is about the Silk Road or Southeast Asian artists, she takes care to explain how it relates to Singapore's multicultural identity.
However, she has also developed a special bond with the museum staff and volunteers. That makes her feel like they are part of her own family. â€œYou walk into the museum and it's like going back home. Sometimes, when we don't have enough visitors, we just walk through and talk to the security staff. They take care of us very well.â€
Over the years, she has learned to tailor her tours to different audiences. When she is with kids in the Peranakan Museum, she takes them to the play area near the wedding galleries, or points out where they can stamp their tickets. When she is with elderly visitors, she asks them about their own heritage and their memories of the past.
VIPs require special treatment. Because they are often on tight schedules, she often has to give them a 20-minute whirlwind tour of an exhibition's star pieces. As she talks, she monitors their faces closely for signs of boredom, so she can lengthen or shorten her explanations accordingly.
The next generation
Recently, Chin Peng has also been training kids to be Mandarin guides themselves. She does twelve-hour workshops with students, teaching them to create tours of the Peranakan Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.
This is difficult for many of them, especially when they have limited vocabulary. When they are asked to write about the artefacts, their descriptions are often full of English words, and hanyu pinyin (Romanised Chinese). But, with a little coaching, Chin Peng builds up their confidence and soon has them speaking fluently in their mother tongue. A few weeks later, their fellow students arrive on a field trip, and the kids are able to present a complete tour of the galleries to their friends.
On occasion, Chin Peng has even had family members join her as volunteers. In 2012, her son Lukas had finished his polytechnic studies, and was waiting to enlist for National Service. He and his cousin decided to help her out with the many activities that the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall had planned for its anniversary. While she led VIPs through the galleries, they worked as receptionists and picked up guests at the airport. This gave them a new sense of appreciation for all the work that goes into sustaining our heritage.
These days, Chin Peng finds that she is often involved in recruitment drives for new volunteersâ€”something she never dreamt she would be doing when she first signed up 14 years ago. She is impressed by the calibre of the new docents, who are often highly educated professionals. Notably, many of them are new immigrants from China, with excellent Mandarin skills.
However, what is most important to her is whether a volunteer is truly committed. â€œI will always ask them, â€˜Do you have the passion? And, do you have the time?' Because if you don't, then it will be very hard,â€ she says. â€œYou may have to make sacrifices. You have to really want this.â€
Of course, Chin Peng's own commitment has never been in question. After years of devoting herself to the health and welfare of her family, she is free to share her knowledge about historyâ€”an act which truly brings her joy.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-pok-cheng-san/story,"story
Pointing to the 19th century church bells, Pok Cheng San tells visitors that Boston bell maker Paul Revere gifted these bells to his son-in-law and first American Consul to Singapore, Joseph Balestier. The Mandarin-speaking docent then adds, â€œIt was just a work trip, but Balestier's father-in-law bade him final farewell!â€
The joke cracks up some 20 Chinese-speaking visitors to the National Museum of Singapore. In Mandarin, â€œgifting bellsâ€ is pronounced â€œsong zhongâ€, which sounds similar to the Chinese words for â€œseeing someone off at his funeralâ€.
This is just one instance of how the 57-year-old brings to life the Singapore story during a two-hour long tour of Singapura: 700 years, an exhibition that retells the history of this city-state. One of 60 Mandarin Guides at the National Heritage Board (NHB), Cheng San gives regular tours at the National Museum of Singapore.
Cheng San's love for history began as a student at River Valley Government Chinese Middle School (now River Valley High School). He fondly recalls how his history teacher used to retell the past with so much gusto. While he did well enough to pursue a degree in history, his parents saved what little education funds they had for Cheng San's eldest brother instead. â€œPeople in their generation gave priority to the first male child,â€ he says with resignation.
Making connections
Cheng San ended up putting himself through a part-time diploma course in business administration. He now works as a human resource manager at a waste wood recycling company. But, on his own time, he continued reading history books as a hobby.
In 2012, when he heard NHB was recruiting docents, he immediately signed up to undergo the seven-month training on Singapore's history. Today, Cheng San is scheduler and research coordinator for NHB's Mandarin Docents.
In his opinion, good docents perform, rather than reel off facts about the exhibits. This is something he learnt from attending tours during his visits to museums in China. Their docents' masterful retelling of history had him staying on till the end of the tour despite his tired legs. It also set a benchmark for his own tours.
â€œI made a promise to myself to become as good as they are,â€ he recalls. This is why he willingly spends months researching and building on the curator's work for his tours, and even tailors his delivery to audiences. â€œIt's boring even for the musician if he performs the same piece every night,â€ he says.
More importantly, he helps audiences see connections, something he found hard to do when he used to read history books for fun. â€œI took in information in fragments, so I couldn't see relationships between events when there were,â€ he recalls. Today, Cheng San sees not only historical connections between museum artefacts, but also has developed the confidence to find clues about the past. Stopping at the painting View of Singapore from Mount Wallich on his tour, he draws the visitors' attention to details in the 19th century painting. Cheng San points out how Telok Ayer Market still stands today as Lau Pa Sat, and the sea it depicts has since been reclaimed to house today's thriving business district.
As the people who join his Mandarin-speaking tours are often tourists from China, Cheng San makes it a point to highlight common histories between Singapore and China. One of them is opium. After the British colonial government established and profited from opium farming and trading in 19th century Singapore, he tells those on tour, many Chinese immigrants became addicted to the drug. His listeners nod their heads sympathetically, reminded of China's Opium War and the resulting cession of Hong Kong.
Cheng San then ushers them to a section featuring prominent Chinese businessman Tan Kah Kee. He asks, â€œWho established the prestigious Xiamen University in Fujian?â€ A visitor in his 20s replies, â€œChen Jiageng!â€
Students in China, Cheng San knows, study about Tan Kah Kee, whose name in Mandarin is Chen Jiageng. But, the familiarity with Tan Kah Kee is an exception, adds Cheng San.
On his tours, he has encountered many tourists who are misinformed about Singapore, often through inaccurate facts they encounter online. This is another reason why he readily volunteers his weekends to give tours, offering more than the 12 sessions a year he needs to fulfil as an NHB docent. Beyond the joy of entertaining museum visitors with stories about Singapore's past, Cheng San says being a docent gives him the opportunity to carry out important work: guiding how visitors perceive this city-state, beginning with an accurate understanding of its past.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-akiko-kato/story,"In 2010, Akiko Kato arrived in Singapore. Her husband had found a job here, so the two had decided to leave Japan, starting a new life in this unfamiliar Southeast Asian city.
At first, life here was strange to them. In Tokyo, she had worked in a bank, then in a human-resources consulting firm. Now, without a career, she had to keep herself busy at home, looking after her children, and occasionally giving private language classes in Japanese.
However, three years later, while shopping at Liang Court, she glimpsed a poster that would change her life. It was an open call for volunteers to join the Japanese Docents, a division of Friends of the Museums. This was right up Akiko's alley. â€œI like museums in general,â€ she says. â€œWhen I go to the United States or Europe, I always visit museums.â€ She had visited several Singapore museums as well, including the National Museum of Singapore (NMS), the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). She loved their cultural importance, and their cosy atmosphereâ€”a welcome relief from the sweltering heat of this country.
After attending a public information meeting by the Japanese Docents, she decided to join them. The process was rather different from that of other volunteers. There was no interview or screening process. â€œIf you want to be in, you're in,â€ Akiko says. Speaking English was not a requirement either, as the entire training programme was conducted in Japanese.
Once she had completed the training programme, she began leading tours at the National Museum. Two months later, she started guiding at ACM. A year later, she added the Peranakan Museum (TPM) to her list. (Handling this many museums is not uncommon: all Japanese docents are expected to volunteer with at least two museums.)
Unique challenges
Akiko now holds the position of Japanese Coordinator on the Committee of the Japanese Docents. She serves as a liaison between the volunteers and the National Heritage Board, and the English-speaking members of Friends of the Museum. Together with the other nine members of the committee, she also coordinates schedules and updates their blog.
She is proud of the group's history. Their roots go back to 1981, when two members of the Friends of the Museum decided to translate the English captions at the National Museum into Japanese. In 1982, they began Japanese tours at the museum twice a month, led by a group of nine docents. The number of volunteers, tours and museums steadily multiplied over the years, with experienced volunteers creating lectures and textbooks to train newcomers. As of June 2017, there were 73 Japanese Docents leading tours at four museums: NMS, ACM, SAM, and TPM almost every day.
The work comes with unique challenges. â€œMost of the docents are expats' wives,â€ Akiko explains. â€œThey stay in Singapore for three years on average, so not so many docents can continue their guiding for a long time. The longest a person has served right now is 11 years.â€
Akiko has found guiding to be tremendously fulfilling. One of her favourite things to talk about is the legacy of Lee Kuan Yew. Despite the traumas he endured during the war, he faced the future, not the past, and built Singapore into a successful multiracial nation. â€œThat is how the world should be,â€ she says. â€œIf all the world had presidents and prime ministers like Lee Kuan Yew, maybe a peaceful world would come.â€ She reveals that many of the Japanese docents wept when he passed away in 2015.
Rewards of guiding
Guiding has also helped her to better understand Japanese culture. Back home, the only religions she had been exposed to were Buddhism and Shintoism. But, as a docent for the ACM, she had to learn about other faiths like Islam, Taoism, and Hinduism. She visited their houses of worship for the first time. Now, when she goes to temples in Japan, she can recognise the Hindu roots behind her own religious icons. It is just another example of how Asian cultures have interacted with each other for thousands of years.
She is looking forward to the opening of ACM's Faith and Belief galleries, which will focus on the spread of religions throughout Asia. She is also eagerly anticipating several upcoming temporary exhibitions. â€œI need to study more and more. I never get bored!â€ she laughs.
Most of all, however, she enjoys the sense of community and belonging that she gets from volunteering. Through Japanese Docents, she has become closer to the Japanese community in Singapore, bonding with her fellow guides through meetings, lectures and outings to heritage destinations such as Kampong Glam and Kusu Island.
And, of course, she has also come to know Singapore better. Walking through the city, she recalls the history of this island through its street names and landmarks. Visiting restaurants, she is able to tell her children the stories behind each piece of kueh or dish of curry, giving them a better sense of local culture.
It is an experience that she thoroughly recommends to everyone who has the time and interest. â€œCome and join us,â€ she says. â€œThe more you learn, the more you can enjoy life in Singapore.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-clara-chan/story,"For decades, Clara Chan's headspace was a whirl of numbers. The investment banker wrote reports whenever a company put its shares on the market for the first time. She kept tabs on gains and losses.
Upon retirement, the 54-year-old decided to follow her heart. Her husband directed her to Friends of the Museums (FOM), which runs a docent training programme.
â€œHe knew that I loved general history. When I travelled, I would always visit a country's main museum to hear stories about the place, people and culture,â€ she said.
After attending an FOM public information meeting, Clara began a six-month training stint. This included lectures by university professors, curators, and experienced docents, learning how to condense volumes of information into a one-hour tour paper, and presenting them to visitors in an engaging manner.
â€œThe structured programme boosted my confidence. Mentors gave us tips on public speaking, which was a new experience for me,â€ Clara said.
In 2010, she gave her first tour at the National Museum of Singapore. Clara took a group around the Singapore History Gallery, through early Singapore, to life during the Japanese Occupation and the city-state's astounding development since.
â€œBeing a Singaporean, it makes me proud to share our history with others. Plus, it's a good feeling when they thank you after a tour,â€ she said.
She picks up tidbits of information from visitors, too. Once, an elderly Singaporean shared an anecdote at the gallery's rickshaw exhibit.
â€œIt was one of her saddest childhood memories. Her neighbour was a rickshaw driver. Every night, she used to watch him peel a layer of debris off the soles of his feet. It was a mixture of dust, dirt, and tar that clung onto his skin,â€ Clara said. â€œI will always remember that story. Now, I share it with other visitors, as it speaks volumes about the generation that has passed.â€
Leading fellow docents
Clara was also part of FOM's training team. She co-led the National Museum of Singapore training in 2010 and in 2013, and co-developed the first training programme at the Malay Heritage Centre.
In 2013, she became the Centre's Coordinator. A year later, she took up the position of Joint Coordinator at the National Museum of Singapore. In 2015, Clara became FOM's President.
â€œAs a docent, I didn't have many opportunities to interact with other volunteers. Now, I attend more meetings so I have gotten to know them better. Some have been guiding for 20 years, so I still have a lot to learn from the long-serving veterans,â€ she shared.
Despite additional commitments, Clara is still an active docent. She conducts tours, keeps up with research, and crafts fresh plans when exhibitions change. On most days, she has a packed schedule of meetings and guiding tasks. As a result, Clara makes it a point to spend evenings with her family. It is usually midnight when she starts to prepare for tours.
â€œGuiding was my first love. To me, the learning should not stop as President. It's just a matter of how I manage my time,â€ Clara said. â€œVolunteering involves self-sacrifice. I see it as my way of thanking society for giving me a new life. Before that, my life was focused on finance â€“ it was not satisfying enough. Now, I lead a very fulfilling life.â€
The future of heritage
During her term as President, Clara hopes to make guiding more inclusive. She wants to equip docents with skills to guide the disabled and those with special needs.
Although FOM has a strength of nearly 1,500, not many members are active volunteers, Clara said. Most FOM docents, who give tours on weekdays, are expatriates.
â€œThere are many reservations about speaking to the public, but it's not that difficult. You just have to remember the key facts,â€ she said. â€œVolunteering results in a lot of personal growth. I would like to encourage more Singaporeans to come on board to volunteer.â€
Clara has convinced at least one young Singaporean to volunteer, albeit in a different sector. Her eldest daughter, who is a journalist, has started volunteering with the non-profit organisation, HealthServe. She helps out with simple duties such as taking the blood pressure of migrant workers.
â€œIn a way, I think my passion for heritage [volunteering] played a part. We are very close and she sees that I enjoy what I'm doing. So, she's pursuing something meaningful, too, aside from her work,â€ Clara said.
â€œI plan to keep up with guiding, as long as I can walk and remember my script,â€ she quipped.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/attack-of-the-swordfish/story,"This story first appeared in National Heritage Board's book, titled, 'Attack Of The Swordfish And Other Singapore Tales' by Charlotte Lim (Text) and Alicia Tan Yen Ping (Illustration). This book consists of six illustrated tales for early Primary school children that are based on Singapore legends or traditions.
â€œFather, look!â€ cried a young boy from the shore. His father, who was unravelling his fishing net, raised his anxious face to the blue sea that had suddenly turned silver. It was teeming with swordfish twisting and stabbing their way towards some fishermen's boats out at sea.
The man dropped the net and ran to sound the village gong. By the time the Raja, Paduka Sri Maharaja, and his soldiers arrived to investigate, they were stunned by all the confusion and panic on the coast.
Men, women and children were screaming and weeping as the long blades of the swordfish shot out of the water and pierced right through the helpless fishermen, killing them all.
The swordfish then rocketed towards the villagers on the shore. â€œRun for your lives!â€ they screeched.
The Raja ordered his brave men to go down to the water. â€œForm a wall with your legs and fight the swordfish!â€ he commanded.
Unfortunately, even the Raja's mighty army could not overcome the swordfish. Soon the gleaming sea turned to a bloody red as the swordfish slashed and sliced the men's legs. When he saw his men groaning and writhing in pain, the Raja called for them to retreat.
The young boy who had first spotted the swordfish taunted, â€œWhy do we make a wall with our legs? It will only hurt us. Why don't we use banana tree trunks instead? That way, the swordfish will only hurt themselves!â€
The Raja was secretly awed by the boy's cleverness but his pride was wounded. Although he did not want to take the boy's advice, he knew that it was the best solution. With much reluctance, he ordered the villages to fell as many banana trees as possible. When the tide was low, the people worked quickly to build a barricade along the seashore.
The soldiers and the people kept watch, armed with parangs and spears. The sluggish sea awoke again. It swelled and shimmered once more with what seemed like an even greater legion of swordfish. This time, the swordfish charged right into the trap and found their sharp bills stuck in the tree trunks!
The villagers leapt into the water and slaughtered the defenceless shoal of swordfish. The island celebrated the victory with a big feast and everyone sang a grateful toast to the boy who saved their lives.
Everyone except the Raja. Jealous and afraid that the people might think the boy more worthy of the throne, the Raja schemed to get rid of him. After the celebrations, he sent his men, cloaked in darkness, to the top of the hill where the boy lived.
There, they committed great evil by stabbing the boy until he died. But the blood of the boy did not remain on their hands alone. It spewed out from the wounds on his body and flooded the hill, turning it slowly into one bloody mound.
The mound later came to be known as Redhill or Bukit Merah. The name remains to this day in modern Singapore as an extraordinary memorial to the boy who was said to have saved his village a long time ago.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/little-india-a-cultural-and-historical-precinct/story,"Text by Ruchi Mittal
MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 - June 2017
Little India is a precinct that is not quite like any other in Singapore. Together with Chinatown and Kampong Glam, it is part of the popular trio of cultural precincts on the tourist circuit. It is also an important place for the local Indian community who visit it to eat, shop, socialise and pray.
Today, it has come to be known as the Indian precinct, but this was not always the case. In fact, Little India was not designated by Sir Stamford Raffles as an area for the Indian community in the Raffles Town Plan. Before Little India got its current name in the 1980s, it was just known as Serangoon, after one of the earliest roads in Singapore. This road was indicated on an 1828 map as the â€œroad leading across the islandâ€.
An Important Thoroughfare: 1819 to 1860
Serangoon Road got its name from the Malay word saranggong. It is likely that this derived either from a marsh bird called ranggong or the term serang dengan gong, which means to beat a gong. It began as an important artery of commerce and transport for the plantations in the interior of the island along the route to Serangoon Harbour. This northern harbour was never a major port of call for Singapore's entrepÃ´t trade. However, it was a vital loading and unloading point for the Johor gambier and pepper planters. These goods would then be transported to town by bullock carts.

The road remained a buffalo-trodden dirt track for many decades. In the 19th century, the opportunities available in Serangoon drew various communities there. Possibly, the most important factor for this was the presence of waterways. The Kallang and Rochor rivers facilitated habitation, transportation and commerce.
For these reasons, many kampongs (Malay for â€œvillagesâ€) were established around the Serangoon area. The Chinese community congregated around the present-day Syed Alwi Road and Balestier Road areas, and were largely involved in farming and plantation activities. The Javanese lived at Kampong Java, while the Baweanese established themselves at Kampong Kapor, many of whom worked at the nearby racecourse.

Kampong Kapor also attracted Indian Muslims, who worked mainly as port labourers and peons (low-ranking office workers).

Serangoon Road proper was laid by convicts who had been brought to Singapore by the British for their labour and were held at a prison at Bras Basah Road. Many of them settled nearby after serving their sentences.

Other Indians also gathered in that area to practice supporting trades. This was the genesis of an Indian district, which later extended down Selegie Road and into Serangoon Road.
Indians called the Serangoon area Soonambu Kambam, meaning â€œVillage of Limeâ€ in Tamil. In the past, lime was an important ingredient of Madras Chunam. This was a kind of cement or plaster brick that was introduced from India and used in construction work. By the 1820s, the British set up lime pits and brick kilns along Serangoon Road, where many Indians found employment. 
An Era of Cows and Buffaloes: 1860 to 1930
The brick kilns were discontinued in 1860. After this, the development of the Serangoon area centred on cattle, which transported produce to town for sale. This area was ideal for cattle because of the abundant water from ponds, mangrove swamps and Rochor River. These provided bathing areas for water buffaloes, which were the workhorses of Singapore at that time and were used for all heavy tasks, from transporting goods to rolling roads.
Many cattle-related industries were established in and around Kandang Kerbau (Malay for â€œbuffalo enclosureâ€). This village was located to the west of Serangoon Road and later became known as Kampong Kerbau. Such industries included slaughterhouses, tanneries and milk peddling.
Postcard of a nearby slaughterhouse at Jalan Besar, c. 1910.

The presence of the cattle industry attracted even more Indian settlers such as North Indian herdsmen from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the early 1900s who settled by Rochor Canal. Until the 1930s, one could also find Bengali and Tamil milkmen around Buffalo Road and Chander Road. They travelled with their goats and cows, bringing fresh milk right to customers' doorsteps. Another common sight was Indian women travelling from house to house, selling fresh homemade thairu (Tamil for â€œyoghurtâ€).

The old Tekka Market was built in 1915 at the junction of Serangoon and Bukit Timah roads as one of the first centralised sites for selling cattle produce. An important reason for building this market was so that the retail activities did not clutter up the verandas and roadways along Serangoon Road.
S. Rasoo, a former watchman at Tekka Market, remembers it as a â€œlively, bustling place with Indian women coming up in their colourful saris, their hair done up in buns or single plaits decorated with fragrant flowers, jostling against the pig-tailed houseboys that served the Europeans and wealthy Asians. The noise was deafening, the atmosphere reverberating with the sound of raised voices bargaining over fresh fish, meats, vegetable and fruitsâ€.

Multicultural Centre of Business and Trade: 1860 to 1970s
Wheat-grinding sheds, sesame oil presses, rattan works, rubber smokehouses and pineapple factories emerged alongside the cattle industry. Although these industries may seem unconnected, they had a symbiotic relationship centred on the wet environment with buffaloes providing the labour. Their waste products were often used as cattle feed.
One such example was taukeh (Malayan term referring to a Chinese businessman of good standing) Tan Teng Niah's sweet factory at Kerbau Road which used sugarcane to manufacture candies. It is likely that the bungalow which can still be seen today was part of this factory.

Sugarcane was transported to Tan's factory by bullock carts, and after the juices were extracted, the leftover fibres were reused as fuel or cattle feed. 
There was a significant Chinese and Malay presence in the Serangoon area at the beginning. However, various factors helped to eventually establish a larger Indian enclave here. For instance, many Indian migrants were employed by the municipality in the early 20th century. From the 1920s, the colonial government started constructing terrace houses in Serangoon to accommodate them. These were known as Municipal Quarters or Coolie Lines. Some of these quarters can still be found in their original form along Hindoo Road in Little India.
Shops and amenities catering to this growing Indian population flourished. There were garland makers, astrologers, goldsmiths, moneylenders, tailors, restaurateurs and shop owners selling luggage, saris, spices and other provisions from India.

The Turmoil Brought by World War II: 1941 to 1945
When the Second World War began, Serangoon Road became one of the targets for Japanese bombers. Kannusamy s/o Pakirisamy (b. 1914) used to live at Buffalo Road as a child. Speaking to the National Archives of Singapore, he recalled: â€œ... some houses were damaged by bombs in front of Hindoo Road and... [in] Farrer Park, some people went and put camps. [...] The Japanese bombs [would] be coming three, six, nine, in V-shape. [...] Houses were all damaged.â€ 
Many people turned to places of worship for refuge at this uncertain time. The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple was one such place where hundreds took shelter. It survived unscathed through the bombing and this was attributed to the power of the deities by its devotees.

However, other sanctuaries were not as fortunate and one side of Foochow Methodist Church was destroyed. Another casualty was Kandang Kerbau (KK) Hospital, where a big red cross was displayed so that it would not be bombed.

Unfortunately, one morning the British began moving their lorries and guns into the compound and the hospital was bombed within half an hour.
At this time, Singapore's second president, Dr Benjamin Sheares (1907 to 1981), was Deputy Medical Superintendent at KK Hospital. As there was only one other doctor at the hospital, both men stayed there and worked in shifts. Midwives were also kept very busy as there were only three nurses to look after around 200 babies.
When the smoke cleared in February 1942, Singapore had become Syonan-To. It is believed that the conquering â€œTiger of Malayaâ€, General Yamashita himself, passed through Serangoon Road. During the first weeks of the Japanese Occupation, New World Park in Serangoon was one of the 28 sites used as a mass-screening centre for the Dai Kensho (Japanese for â€œgreat inspectionâ€) operation to remove anti-Japanese elements within the Chinese population of Singapore, later known as the Sook Ching (Mandarin for â€œcleansing through purgingâ€) massacre.
The Urbanisation of Serangoon Road: 1945 to 1980s
Even after the war ended in 1945, its effects on Little India's socio-economic landscape remained. Many shop owners had sold their businesses to their hired hands before they fled the island. Those who survived moved up the social ladder in the post-war era.
P. Govindasamy Pillai, affectionately known as PGP, had five sari shops in Serangoon before World War II. He left for India in 1941, handing his business to a relative. He returned after the war to continue his business. While new businessmen were just setting up in the 1960s, PGP was already moving ahead and renovating his existing stores. He was also known for his generosity in using his wealth for philanthropic purposes and supporting community institutions such as temples.

Once Singapore attained full independence in 1965, there was a drive to clean up and renew the city. Early efforts focused mainly on the town area and later expanded outwards to encompass Serangoon. At this time, many residents of this area were living in dark, cramped and unhygienic conditions. By the mid-1970s, concrete development plans had been introduced with the Housing & Development Board (HDB) setting aside a significant sum of S$4 million for Kampong Kapor's renewal.
In 1980, it was decided that the old Tekka Market had to be relocated to a better facility nearby. The Zhujiao Centre (now Tekka Centre) was thus built across the road in 1981. It was planned as one of the early residential-cum- shopping complexes in Singapore and included a wet market, food centre and HDB homes.
Serangoon becomes Little India: 1980s to Present Day
Little India as we know it today was not officially named as such until the 1980s. This was the result of a concerted effort by the then Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) to promote the preservation and celebration of Singapore's ethnic quarters.
Today, Little India is a district that offers something for everyone. While local Indians visit the temples here and shop for traditional goods, non-Indian locals and tourists also come to soak in the culture and history of this historical precinct. Launched in 2017, the Little India Heritage Trail reveals some of the stories and memories of this area, while offering three thematic routes for visitors to better understand this area.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2014
Travelling along the arboreal forested highways with graceful four-limbed locomotion is an enigmatic acrobat in a black coat of fur: The Banded Leaf Monkey.
Visitors to local parks and nature areas such as MacRitchie Reservoir and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (BTNR) would be familiar with the sight of sizeable troops of monkeys foraging by the trails. Known as the Long-tailed Macaque (Macaca fascicularis), this opportunistic primate has managed to thrive despite widespread disturbance of its habitats, its omnivorous habits and tolerance of humans. A few regard the macaques as nuisances, but to others, their presence adds a rare touch of the wild and wonderful to life in the urban jungle, and many weekend warriors savour the opportunity to see this versatile survivor of Singapore's natural heritage.
Not many people, however, are aware of another monkey that dwells in the deeper parts of our nature reserves. Unlike the long-tailed macaque, this creature seldom descends to the ground and would find human treats unpalatable and indeed, harmful, to its health. And though it was once found all over Singapore, it now survives only in small patches of forest in the heart of the island.
Shy and Scare Vegetarians
A study in black and white, the Banded Leaf Monkey (Presbytis femoralis) is a startlingly pretty animal with midnight fur and ivory bands traversing the underside of its body and limbs. A diversity in hairstyles is often observed; while the scruffy, unkempt look is the most popular, an upswept Mohawk hairdo is also not rare.

Unlike the long-tailed macaques, which happily snack on insects and bird's eggs when given the chance, the banded leaf monkey advocates strict vegetarianism, consuming primarily fruits and immature leaves. However, typical Singaporeans that they are, they are extremely picky about their diet. Depending on the season and the availability of favoured fruits, the monkeys travel long distances in order to procure suitable food, which contrary to popular belief is not always abundant everywhere in the forest. Thus, their survival may hinge on the continued existence of sufficient and uninterrupted expanses of forest that would allow the monkeys to locate their preferred food sources. The constraints of living in land-scarce Singapore is as much a reality to them as anyone else; the leaf monkeys share their minuscule forest plots with Singapore's two other native primates: the aforementioned long-tailed macaques and the rare Sunda Slow Loris (Nycticebus coucang), a wide-eyed, fluffy thing that comes out only at night to feed on fruit, nectar and insects.
Shy by nature, the banded leaf monkey is almost always the first to crash away into the depths of the jungle upon seeing a human. This comes as no surprise, given that these monkeys were frequently trapped as pets and poached for the cooking pot by people many decades ago. In those earlier, more innocent days, scenes of banded leaf monkeys leaping in an orderly line across the forests emitting calls that can be heard kilometres away were common throughout the island.
Up to the 1920s, banded leaf monkeys were still reported to be widespread in various areas including Bukit Timah, Changi, Pandan, Tampines, and Tuas, where industrial estates and shopping malls presently stand. Deforestation for urban development led to the relentless shrinking of their habitat, confining them to isolated woods in the BTNR and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR); a decline which, unfortunately, did not stop there. On October 1987, an elderly female believed to be the last banded leaf monkey in the BTNR was mauled to death by dogs as she climbed down a tree. She now rests in peace at the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR), a formalin-drenched reproach in charcoal and horn. With the subsequent construction of the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) right across the two reserves, habitat availability for wildlife dwindled as the remaining two green lungs of Singapore were disconnected, arresting biodiversity exchange and leaving the CCNR as the last refuge of the banded leaf monkeys in Singapore.
â€œWe must do whatever we can, together with the rest of the world, to slow down the loss of biological diversity. Let's try to do something to conserve the banded leaf monkeys because it is a very powerful symbol of what we are trying to do in Singapore to conserve the endangered species, both of plants and trees as well as mammals.â€
- Professor Tommy Koh, Ambassador-at-Large, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chairman, National Heritage Board. Professor Koh was speaking as guest-of-honour at â€˜An Evening Dedicated to Conserving Singapore's Biodiversity,' a seminar organised by the National University of Singapore on 16 April 2010.
Taking Stock of our Natural Heritage
Singapore's incessant march towards greater development in the past century has also contributed to a severe decline in the diversity of her native wildlife species. Some are sadly believed to be beyond rescue, such as the Cream-coloured Giant Squirrel (Ratufa af nis). This cat-sized rodent was first described from Singapore in 1821, but only two individuals were last sighted by 1995. Previously described by Sir Stamford Raffles as being abundant in the forests, this species is probably already extinct in Singapore.
On a similar note, some 30% of the total native vascular plant flora (namely flowering plants, conifers and ferns) is presumed nationally extinct, with another 30% regarded as critically endangered in Singapore as of 2010. This deterioration in local species richness and abundance is a call for urgent action in research and measures to conserve the endangered species that still survive in Singapore, lest they go the way of the cream-coloured giant squirrel.
The banded leaf monkey was first described from our nation in 1838 and is considered Critically Endangered in Singapore. Based on fur colouration and other physical characteristics, some scientists believe that the banded leaf monkey may be a subspecies unique to Singapore, differing from populations in neighbouring Johor, Malaysia. As a key representative of our natural heritage, the banded leaf monkey deserves a high priority in conservation. However, the difficulty in tracking and observing these enigmatic primates has been a major factor deterring researchers from studying them. Little is known about their natural history and ecology, except that their population size was estimated at just 10 in the 1980s and approximately 20 in the 1990s.
Recent Discoveries Bring Hope
My strong interest and love for primates propelled me to carry out a Master's research project on the banded leaf monkey in Singapore, 15 years after the only other study done on this elusive species. With generous funding from the Ah Meng Memorial Conservation Fund by Wildlife Reserves Singapore and logistical support from the National Parks Board, I spent nearly two years trudging through the tangled expanses of the forest.
But this effort has finally paid off. We estimate the present local population to consist of at least 40 banded leaf monkeys as of 2010, two times greater than previously believed. We have also provided the first report on their reproductive biology and infant development, and found encouraging signs that the population may be recovering. In addition, food plant species have been identified through feeding observations, the first preliminary analysis of their feeding ecology. This provides valuable information on the species of trees the monkeys require to adequately feed and thrive.

Furthermore, we have clarified the taxonomic debate on whether the Singapore population is the same subspecies as that in Johor through genetic studies of their faeces. Contrary to prior belief, the banded leaf monkeys in Singapore and Johor are likely to be the same subspecies, elevating hopes of possible translocation and reintroduction of the species in both localities in order to ensure their long-term survival. A comparative study on the different populations of the banded leaf monkeys is therefore essential towards a deeper understanding of their population ecology. With a research grant from the Jane Goodall Institute in Singapore, I will be continuing my research on the banded leaf monkeys, this time on those found in Malaysia.
Despite depressing news of various species going extinct over the years, some heartening rediscoveries in Singapore's natural heritage do help to lift the spirit a little. For instance, during my research on the banded leaf monkey, we rediscovered several plant species previously thought to be locally extinct. And in 2008, Marcus Chua, a fellow student at the National University of Singapore, rediscovered the greater mousedeer (Tragulus napu) with signs of a breeding population in Pulau Ubin during his field research. These are the results of a continuous effort in scientific research into local biodiversity, and demonstrate the importance of regular studies and monitoring in order to provide timely updates on species abundance and distribution. Hope is not all lost!

The preservation of our natural heritage requires concerted efforts from each and every individual of the society. The findings of my research on banded leaf monkeys, which were possible thanks to the support of both the public and private sectors, are evidence of this. Contributions from and collaborations between researchers, educational institutions, government bodies and non-governmental organisations can enhance the quality of biodiversity research and increase the appreciation of our national treasures, many of which are uniquely Singapore's. Strong public support and interest is also vital to conservation efforts, as citizens become aware and more appreciative of Singapore's natural heritage and the need to strike a balance between urban development and maintaining the health and biodiversity of our remaining forests.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 â€“ Jun 2017
Museums are human institutions which play an important role in the public enjoyment of history, heritage, art and even science. Many of the museums we are familiar with boast wonderful repositories of national collections and artefacts. Community museums and galleries, on the other hand, play the role of documenting and conveying history and heritage through the social memories of people, be it through interviews, old photos or personal collections.
Work @ TJ â€“ The Industrious Pioneers of Jurong was the third in a series of community co-created thematic exhibitions at Our Museum @ Taman Jurong, which chronologically charted the development of Jurong and the evolving occupations of its residents. Stories were told through residents' memories, beginning from the pre-1960s when Jurong was considered a ""lost region"" due to the lack of people and development, to the present day in 2017 where Jurong is a major driver of the nation's industry and economy.
Pre-1960s â€“ No Man&Rsquo;s Land
The Jurong of yesteryear would be completely unrecognisable today. A largely undeveloped area, farms, plantations, ponds, and mangroves could be found all around. Residents of early Jurong took on jobs as farmers and rubber tappers at the many gambier and rubber plantations found in this vast area in the 19th century. These plantations and farms, which were the main work sites in Jurong, played a major role in the area's subsequent development.

A legacy of the early 20th century which still lives on till this day is the brickworks industry. Pottery kilns were located in Jurong due to the favourable soil found in the area. Up to 800,000 bricks could be produced each month in these kilns. One of the oldest surviving pottery kilns â€“ the Thow Kwang Pottery Jungle, also commonly known as the Dragon Kiln, is still located in Jurong today.

1960S â€“ Evolution
With the dawn of the 1960s, Jurong experienced huge changes that permanently altered its landscape. Singapore embarked on a massive industrialisation programme with Jurong as its core. Through this programme, Jurong was redeveloped with 1,600 hectares reserved for the Jurong Industrial Estate. The same land that once housed farms and plantations were redeveloped to make way for factories such as NatSteel, Jurong Shipyard, Jurong Wharf, Jurong Fishery Port and military camps such as Pasir Laba Camp.

As the Jurong workforce grew to meet the demands of the area's development, so did its residential aspects.
Madam Sandy Lee recounts her mother's story about opening the first hair salon in Jurong: â€œShe said, â€˜The government wrote a letter to us, asking us to open a salon in Taman Jurong... This place is so far and deserted. If not for the government's letter, we wouldn't have come to Taman Jurong!'â€
Madam Sandy Lee's (pictured) mother operated one of the first hair salons in Taman Jurong â€“ Xin Toh [æ–°éƒ½] Hair Salon. Located at the ground floor of Block 1, Taman Jurong, the salon not only provided haircuts at an affordable price, but also warm towels, comic books, and shaving services for its patrons, 2016. Courtesy of National Heritage Board.
To encourage workers to stay in Jurong, then Finance Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee set up a toll gate which charged lorries and buses $50 a month for transporting workers into Jurong. As a result, companies began to set up living quarters for their workers within Jurong. Thus, as Jurong grew in its capacity for the nation's economy, so did its population. Mr Quah Kim Poh, a long-time resident of Jurong, shares: â€œJurong then was very inaccessible and many Singaporeans refused to reside in this area. It was due to industrialisation that made Jurong an international metropolis [sic].â€
As some of the first residents to move into Taman Jurong, in the 1970s, Mr and Mrs Quah Kim Poh were witnesses to the many changes that took place as Jurong industrialised. Until today, their entire family continues to reside in Taman Jurong, demonstrating the strong ties that envelop this community, 2016. Courtesy of National Heritage Board.
1970S â€“ From Strength to Strength
The 1970s is widely known as the prime decade for Jurong, with its tremendous growth and plentiful job opportunities. In 1970, Jurong Port hit the million-tonne mark for the amount of cargo handled in a year.

At the same time, many multinational companies from all over the world were coming to invest. By 1976, there were 650 factories operating in Jurong, and tens of thousands of workers being employed. Farms and plantations which were a major part of the 1960s had to make way for growing industrialisation. Residents here were employed in various fields of work.

Madam Halijah binte Sulaiman, for example, worked at the WMF Flatware Factory at 7 Gul Avenue, where her daily tasks included polishing high-quality cutleries to a shine before they were shipped for exports. The industrialisation programme proved to be a success as unemployment dropped to under 3% in the 1970s from 14% in 1964.
The military also expanded its capabilities with specialised training schools for different vocations being set up in the Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute (SAFTI), which was located in Jurong.

1980S â€“ Present Day: Into The New World
In the 1980s, developments in Jurong shifted towards technology and knowledge-based industries. This change was reflected in Jurong's landscape as heavy manufacturing companies began to move out, and chemical and technological industries, along with light manufacturing started to move in. Workers had to equip themselves with new skills to keep up with the changing demands of the job.
During this decade, Jurong also became key to another aspect of Singapore â€“ waste management. The Tuas Incineration Plant heralded this new era with its completion in 1986. Subsequently, Tuas South Incineration Plant and Keppel Seghers Tuas Waste-to-Energy Plant were added in 2000 and 2009 respectively. Combined, they make up more than half of Singapore's incineration capacity.
Looking to The Future
There is no doubt that Jurong will continue to play a significant part in driving Singapore's industry and economy. As it continues to evolve, one new addition is expected to add to its changing landscape from 2017 onwards; a second Central Business District. With a peak into the future, the workers and residents of Jurong can certainly be expected to continue transforming the landscape of Singapore.

Work @ TJ â€“ The Industrious Pioneers of Jurong ran till end-July 2017 at the foyer of Taman Jurong Community Club. To provide an immersive multi-sensory experience, this exhibition featured unique scents specially developed and generously by Givaudan, the global leader in the creation of flavours and fragrances that 'engage your senses'. These scents included that of oil at a shipyard, brickworks at a pottery kiln, tyres in a car workshop, mangroves and even National Servicemen in training. While Givaudan generally works with food, beverage, consumer product, and fragrance partners, their passion for understanding consumers' preferences and their relentless drive to innovate enabled them to create these special scents, which undoubtedly left a lasting impression on visitors both young and old. Visitors were able to imagine what it was like to work and live in Jurong in the past or to reminisce about the good old days. For more information, visit Our Museum @ Taman Jurong's Facebook page.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 - Jun 2017
The task of mapping the historical area of Kampong Gelam (often spelled as â€œKampong Glamâ€) is a daunting one. One has to consider not only its labyrinth of former side streets and alleyways, but also the numerous paths and shortcuts traversed by the many that once worked and lived in the area. Although Kampong Gelam was gazetted as a conservation area in 1989, many of these routes and pathways had by then become a thing of the past. Various roads were expunged through the 1960s and 1970s, and business owners â€“ including various printers and publishers â€“ had already begun moving out or closing down their offices. To chart a trail through Kampong Gelam to better understand its history, it appears, is therefore always to be trailing behind its history, always a step too late to the scene of what was before.
Mereka Utusan: Imprinting Malay Modernity, 1920sâ€“1960s was the Malay Heritage Centre's (MHC) fifth special exhibition, and it sought to recover the oft-forgotten history of the Malay language print and publishing industry in Singapore. In line with MHC's theme for 2017, Bahasa (Malay for ""language""), the exhibition considered not only the language of the Jawi script used by Malay publishers of the time, but also the visual language of advertisements, editorial cartoons and comic strips prevalent in the Malay publications. More importantly, it restored the importance of Kampong Gelam as a node within a regional network of Malay printers, publishers and readers. The district's importance reached a peak in the period between the 1900s to the 1950s, when no less than six printers and publishers could be found in various spots around Kampong Gelam.
As part of the exhibition, a guided trail consisting of stops at the sites of former printing and publishing offices in Kampong Gelam was held in March 2017. Entitled Di-chetak Oleh (Malay for â€œprinted byâ€), the title references the small print often written at the bottom of the back of Malay magazines to denote their printing companies' names.
A cover of Fesyen magazine from 1959. The magazine was printed at HARMY Press which was located at 101 Jalan Sultan, 1959. Published by HARMY Press.
For example: Di-chetak oleh Al-Ahmadiah Press, Di-chetak oleh Qalam Press, and so on. For the team involved in the exhibition, the title also conjured memories of entire days spent close-reading and poring over hundreds of Jawi magazines kept in the MHC Collection, contributed by readers and former publishers.
101 Jalan Sultan, where HARMY Press and Al-Ahmadiah Press were based, c. 1950s. Published by Qalam Press.
In keeping with this spirit, the trail invited participants to contribute to the program by handling artefacts from this archive as well as those shared by our exhibition partners during the course of the trail. Participants then shared their reactions to these objects and artefacts, as if they too were helping to piece together this now-lost history of Kampong Gelam.
These objects and artefacts which the participants handled consisted of Jawi magazines from MHC's education collection, and lead letterpress types that would have been used by Malay printers and publishers. A special treat for the participants was getting to experience a scent specially created by leading international fragrance company, Givaudan, whose perfumers were inspired by their trip to MHC's Pustaka (the term â€œpustakaâ€ encompasses language, literature and publishing) gallery. The intent behind these trail aids was to create a trail that was impressionistic rather than didactic, and was reminiscent of French writer Michel de Certeau's musings of walking aimlessly in the city and being bombarded by â€œthe chorus of idle footstepsâ€. For many who lived and worked in Kampong Gelam, these impressions were their guide to the area. Through speaking with Mr Abdul Aziz bin Abu Talib, a descendant of the owner of Royal Press (formerly located at 745 North Bridge Road), who was in his 60s, the curators discovered that his memories of navigating Kampong Gelam as a young printing apprentice to his father were filtered through such impressions as bicycling through the area, pulling eight-hour workdays in the printing office and wandering between the various side streets.
Photographs of the Royal Press Printing office at 745 North Bridge Road, c. 1946 to 1956. Published by Qalam Press.
Such impressions of navigating Kampong Gelam provide a contrast to town plans, surveys and maps of the area which have been done as far back as the 1820s. Rather than providing clarity to the orientation of the area, these mapping projects were intended to rationalise the area for the purpose of future development and planning. It is not coincidental that such mapping projects of Kampong Gelam often preceded redevelopment projects, in which streets such as North Bridge Road and Victoria Street were paved and other streets such as Palembang Road and Jeddah Street became expunged over time. The irony, then, of such clear-eyed mapping projects and route surveys is the ultimate alteration of these very spaces.
Rapid development in the Kampong Gelam area, particularly in 1960s to 2010s, has therefore created what de Certeau refers to as â€œblind spotsâ€ within our field of vision towards â€œspace itselfâ€. This includes the history of that particular space, the organic interactions that take place within it, as well as its activities â€“ all of which would escape a detached overview of that space.
The printers and publishers of Kampong Gelam are just some of the many historical agents who have since slinked off into these so-called â€œblind spotsâ€, particularly in the aftermath of a ban on printing factories within the area in the 1990s. Only traces of these printers and publishers remain in the physical landscape of Kampong Gelam today, barely discernible amidst the rows of textile shops, dimly lit massage parlours, watering holes and bustling family eateries. With the exception of a few architectural hints, there is nothing to indicate, for example, that a thriving KTV pub along Arab Street was once the site of a printing office for the religious magazine Al-Imam, or that the popular toy store along Bussorah Street once attracted a crowd of a different sort in the early 19th century as the office of Javanese printer, Haji Muhammad Siraj. In this regard, the trail aids also help participants to imagine for themselves a historical impression of the area as it would have been like at different points in time.
Continuities do, however, exist between present sites in Kampong Gelam and their past incarnations as printing offices. The site of Islamic Restaurant, currently located at 745 North Bridge Road, is still owned by the family of Abu Talib bin Ally as of 2017, who previously ran Royal Press. In a different manner, the Sultan Hotel's tours at its three-storey shophouse unit has also served to introduce visitors to the building's previous history as the site of Al-Ahmadiah Press and HARMY Press.

Interacting with the family of Abu Talib bin Ally and the management of the Sultan Hotel revealed a second and possibly more important aspect of the trail. Through this trail, museum practitioners were pushed to engage with the descendants and inheritors of these legacies. Whilst the trail aids filled gaps in the historical narrative of the area, it was these anecdotes from people who formerly lived and who continue to work in the area that enlivened the trail.
Engaging such individuals and families also facilitates MHC's efforts in building itself as an institution of and for the area from which it operates. In this regard, the exhibition could be seen as expanding upon the premise established by MHC's 2015 exhibition â€“ Kampong Gelam: Beyond the Port Town which considered the cultural, economic and social histories of Kampong Gelam. This exhibition and trail continues to follow that train of thought, by looking specifically to the printers and publishers of the area, who in many ways contributed to the economic and cultural vibrancy of the area. Indeed, from the heart of a port town, one is invited to cast a closer look at the many printing and publishing offices that once called Kampong Gelam home.

â€œThe Global Indian International School (GIIS) believes that expatriates are part of its multi-faceted heritage, hence they should upkeep Singapore's social fabric,â€ said Rohit Ambekar, Director of Business & Strategy for GIIS.
The overarching Global Schools Foundation has educated numerous expatriate children, from Kindergarten to Class 12 since its origin in 2002, and presently has 15,000 students across all its campuses globally.
Students from 42 nationalities study in its three campuses, located in Queenstown, Balestier and East Coast in Singapore. GIIS has a global footprint in seven countries - Singapore, India, Malaysia, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and UAE.
â€œOur core curriculum is Indian and our roots are embedded in Indian culture and heritage. But, our education system is more pluralistic than that,â€ Mr Ambekar explained.
Among other goals, GIIS hopes to instil a respect for universal values and ethics, which is â€œvery much in tune with multiculturalism and the coexistence of different races in Singapore,â€ he said.
With this in mind, GIIS made a generous donation in support of the Indian Heritage Centre's â€˜Once Upon a Time in Little India' exhibition last year. It runs until 21st July 2017.
â€œWe wanted to be associated with the Indian culture at a deeper level. Intuitively, you would think that labelling something as an Indian exhibition is divisive. But, it's actually very beautiful,â€ said Mr Ambekar.
â€œWhen the Indian culture came to Singapore, it was hybridised with the other predominant Chinese and Malay cultures. The exhibition showcases the contributions of Indians with a uniquely Singapore spin,â€ he added.
Engaging visitors
The exhibition tells the story of Little India â€“ a cultural enclave for the South Asian community â€“ through photographs, artefacts, and contemporary art installations.
It features the works of filmmaker K. Rajagopal, and artists Kumari Nahappan and Navin Rawanchaikul. Groups of GIIS students have visited the exhibition.
Elements of gamification and virtual reality, found in the centre, kept students engaged. â€œThey put a very interesting, modern spin on heritage issues,â€ Mr Ambekar said.
â€œThe feedback has been great. Students loved the exhibition and the Indian Heritage Centre. And, of course, being young children, they enjoyed the day out as well,â€ he shared.
Mr Ambekar, who has visited museums around the world, was just as impressed with the centre's larger-than-life LED wall. While moving between galleries, visitors can get closer to colourful displays of Indian icons and architecture.
â€œI'm a modern tech geek,â€ quipped Mr Ambekar. â€œI appreciate the amount of thought that's gone into the minutiae, in creating something which is just one part of an overall exhibition.â€
What's next
Like many institutions, GIIS hopes to be a role model for the young. This means the school focuses on more than academics. Its curriculum includes sports, problem solving and community service.
â€œWe're a platform that allows young people to shape their future. If someone wants to become an entrepreneur, we help them. If someone wants to teach or dedicate their lives to volunteer work, we help with that,â€ Mr Ambekar said.
â€œI'd like to think that the leaders of tomorrow are going to need much more than good results,â€ he added.
Still, more can be done to get the young excited about heritage. The ongoing dialogue between schools and key stakeholders is a good start, Mr Ambekar said.
He added that students may enjoy visiting other museums and heritage sites, and walking along historical stretches of Singapore, such as Boat Quay.
A culture of giving
To recognise its contributions, GIIS will receive one of this year's Patron of Heritage Awards in May.
â€œOn the most basic level, contributing creates awareness. Philanthropy is part of our DNA, being owned by a foundation, so we will continue to do so,â€ said Mr Ambekar.
â€œWe try to imbibe that kind of giving philosophy in our students as well. So, when they grow up in their own spheres, as they become successful, they will think about others and not entirely about themselves,â€ he added.
The school hopes to continue giving more than dollars and cents. â€œI'd like to see us engaging (with heritage) in a deeper way. This is something that will evolve over time,â€ Mr Ambekar said.
â€œIt's our belief that we are a core part of the Indian heritage of Singapore. By offering Indians a continuity of education, we have enabled a funnel of Indian expatriates to come and contribute to the economy.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/patrons-of-heritage/Givaudan,"Scents of Singapore's History
A fragrance company is donating old, familiar smells to enhance visitors' experience of museums.
Ben Webb, the regional head of fragrances at Givaudan Singapore.
The Singapore River smelled bad in the 1970s. Hawkers, squatters, and manufacturers crowded the river banks and treated the river as if it were a toilet and bin centre. In 1977, the government started cleaning it up. Over the next 10 years, it spent $170 million on the river â€” first relocating the people and businesses and then dredging out the stinky mud.
So, it was peculiar to many when the National Museum of Singapore revived the acrid river smell for its permanent galleries during Singapore's 50th anniversary in 2015. Repulsive it may be, but the museum hoped this stench would evoke sweet memories of a bygone era. After all, the Singapore River has witnessed many of this country's significant economic and social activities.
Donated scents
Swiss fragrance company Givaudan helped the museum create the sensorial exhibition. â€œIt was a very natural collaboration between us because scents have such amazing powers to transport us back to a memory, a place or a time in our lives,â€ says Ben Webb, the company's Head of Fragrance Division in Asia Pacific. This power has to do with how the brain areas are connected. The olfactory bulb where the smell is understood, Ben explains, is closely linked to the brain regions that handle memory and emotion. This is why elderly visitors to the gallery experience a flood of memories from before the 70s, while those much younger have a deeper experience of Singapore's history.
Because the stench of the river is no more, Givaudan's perfumer, Sreevidhya Venkatesh, relied on archival research and oral histories to identify the characters and activities that might have contributed to this unforgettable smell. She eventually narrowed it down to the spice traders, the cooked-food hawkers, and the diesel-powered boats.
Besides the smell of the Singapore River, Givaudan also donated other scents to the museum. Visitors entering a gallery on the city's colonial past can smell â€œAfternoon Teaâ€ just as the British would have, while a â€œTembusu flowersâ€ scent accompanies an exhibit that looks at Singapore's greening efforts. The latter came to the attention of perfumer, Claude Charmoille, when he first moved to Singapore. He noticed the scent during his evening walks and managed to trace it to this towering tree species that is indigenous to Singapore. For him, and probably many others, the tembusu fragrance evokes images of Singapore as a garden city.
Givaudan not only emulated environmental scents for the museum, but also created a new fragrance to mark Singapore's jubilee. The limited-edition unisex perfume, City, is made from a blend of local ingredients ranging from orchids to ambrettes so that it encapsulates this city's â€œenergy and dynamismâ€, says Ben.
Received POHA
The National Heritage Board honoured Givaudan with a Patron of Heritage award in recognition of the company's efforts to enhance visitors' experience of Singapore's history at the National Museum. Ben says Givaudan is very happy to contribute its technical and creative expertise to the National Museum. It has also done so for the Malay Heritage Centre, Taman Jurong's community museum, and a Scents and Memories workshop at the Singapore Heritage Festival 2016.
â€œHeritage is especially important to Givaudan as our company has been around for almost 250 years,â€ adds Ben.  
Besides contributions by corporations like his, Ben says the local community plays an important role in keeping heritage alive. Givaudan depended on it for guidance and feedback when recreating scents for the Malay Heritage Centre recently.
â€œThe public is very much a part of creating connections to the nation's heritage either by passing on their own memories or by creating new ones whenever they visit the museums,â€ says Ben.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/A-Taste-of-History-at-Little-India/Story,"Mention Little India, and popular eateries such as Komala Vilas and Banana Leaf Apolo come to mind. These are some of the iconic food spots that have grown to be synonymous with Little India, alongside the likes of Tekka Market, Little India Arcade and Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple.
And if you have gone on the Little India Heritage Trail, or taken a stroll through the precinct, food undeniably stands out as a distinctive slice of Little India's unique character and identity. And it is especially heart-warming to know that many of these eateries, whether well-established restaurants or quaint coffee stalls, still remain as family-run businesses steeped in heritage, with rich histories and intimate stories to share. These are living testaments of our intangible food heritage, where traditional recipes, some concocted within family kitchens, are passed down through generations and shared with all Singaporeans. Here, are some insights into these families, their food and their stories.
On 76 Serangoon Road stands Komala Vilas, the oldest restaurant in Little India. The South Indian vegetarian restaurant was opened in 1947 by Murugiah Rajoo, who arrived from the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu, India, in 1936.
Masala Thosai at Komala Vilas
In his quest to create an authentic Indian dining experience, Murugiah may have introduced masala thosai, (a thin crepe made from rice and lentils, and stuffed with potato, methi and curry) for which the restaurant is famous for, to Singapore.
â€œYou have to serve good food, which is tasty, and is reasonably priced,â€ says Mr Rajoo Gunasekaran, Komala Vilas' Managing Director and son of its founder. â€œWord gets around, and when people from India come to visit Singapore, they come here too,â€ he explains. Mr Gunasekaran, 65, says that he has done little to change the way the business has been run, 70 years into its existence.
Mr Rajoo Gunasekaran, Managing Director of Komala Villas
â€œI took over from my father in 1980, and I have always followed the traditional way of running this business,â€ he adds. This means he makes sure the restaurant gets the basics of taste and quality right, and that customers are properly and politely served. On any given day, Mr Rajoo can also be seen seated behind the cashier's till collecting payments, which are usually made in cash. His son, Rajakumar, like him, will take over from his father one day.
Khan's Restaurant at 149 Dunlop Street is another setup run by father and son. It opened 15 years ago after moving from its original location at Beach Road. Says Mr Yousof Khan, 60, â€œOur customers can be quite fussy. They will tell me if something's not right, but that's good because it shows they care.â€
According to Mr Yousof, the area around Dunlop Street was practically empty when he first moved in. â€œNow you see different people coming here, locals as well as tourists,â€ he quips.
Did you know that the Madras New Woodlands Restaurant on 10 Upper Dickson Road has absolutely nothing to do with Woodlands, where the Causeway is situated?
Thali with Battura bread at Madras New Woodlands
â€œWoodlands is actually a well-known place in Madras (now Chennai); an area of trees and cottages,â€ explains its owner, Mr A Dinakaran, who is in his 60s. Opened in 1983, the restaurant hires its chefs from India.
â€œOur chefs are trained for years, and they grew up as cooks. They did not learn to cook at a college. Theirs is the authentic passing down of traditional vegetarian cuisine, which makes our food authentic,â€ insists Mr Dino, as he is often called. He adds that his is the first restaurant in Little India to have an open kitchen.
â€œI wanted Indian food to shine, to be known to the other races. With Singapore being a multi-cultural society, I felt that other ethnic groups must know how Indian food is prepared,â€ explains Mr Dino.
However, being a restaurant owner was not his initial plan. While studying to be a vet, he dropped out of university and entered the food business after his parents ran into financial trouble. â€œI had the entrepreneurial spirit to make money, mainly because my parents ran out of money,â€ says Mr Dino.
Mr C Sankaranathan had quite the opposite experience. The group CEO of the Apollo Group, which runs Banana Leaf Apolo Restaurant at 54 Race Course Road, was 12 when his father asked him if he should sell the business to a businessman from Hong Kong, who was offering $10 million for it.
â€œI said no,â€ shares Mr Sanker, 45. â€œWe grew up with the business. We know a lot of our customers. I thought, what are we going to do when it is gone?â€
The restaurant got its name from his father, who was a fruit seller before opening the restaurant in 1974. â€œIt was named Banana Leaf after the traditional way in which Indians eat â€“ from a banana leaf,â€ explains Mr Sankar. And Apolo? â€œThat came from the Apollo spaceship which made a moon landing (in 1969),â€ says Mr Sankar. He said his father wanted the success of the restaurant to go to the moon, so he called it Apollo. It was changed to Apolo because of his father's belief in numerology.

â€œThe restaurant opened at Cuff Road when I was 2. My father started with a unique menu, which had fish head curry, and it attracted lots of Chinese customers. The crowds started coming after that.â€ The restaurant moved to its current location in 1986, and one person who remembers it from its days at Cuff Road is Mr V Vijaykumarr, 48, who first went to the restaurant in 1980, when he was 12.
â€œIt was a treat from my parents for doing well in my PSLE exams,â€ said Mr Vijay. â€œI asked to be taken to a restaurant, and the fact they chose this one says a lot. It was, for me, a first love. Over the years, I have come to this restaurant and they have always kept their high standards,â€ adds Mr Vijay.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Caldecott-Through-the-Years/story,"For the past 80 years, you have known it as the stomping ground of Singapore's best-loved television and radio stars, and where our television classics such as â€˜Under One Roof', â€˜The Unbeatables' and â€˜The Little Nyonya' were created.
What is lesser known is Caldecott Hill's long history that predates the arrival of radio and television to our shores. The hill was named after Sir Andrew Caldecott, the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements in the 1930s, and its roads, named after members of his family, namely Lady Olive, his wife (Olive Road), and Joan and John, their children (Joan Road and John Road). These colourful personalities and little-known tales of Caldecott Hill's past deserve their own retelling.
Thomson's Roads
Long before the Housing and Development Board and urban planners of our time, Caldecott was part of the larger Toa Payoh district, where it started off as a large undeveloped marshland in the early 1800s.
All that changed when Englishman John Turnbull Thomson arrived in Singapore 1841 as a Government Surveyor. Thomson put together the very first maps of Singapore's town centre, and also engineered the building of Thomson Road, among other important contributions during his 12 years in Singapore.
Under Thomson's charge, proper roads were built through the Toa Payoh district, which changed the composition of the area entirely. The roads enabled access to areas that were previously impassable and the surrounding rural land could be developed.
Seah's Legacy
Seah Eu Chin, also popularly known as the â€œking of pepper and gambierâ€ in his time, was a Chinese immigrant who made a fortune from trading in pepper and gambier during the 19th century.
Portrait of Seah Eu Chin, Collection of National Museum of Singapore
Back then, the Thomson and Caldecott area was a place where rich businessmen set up plantation houses and grew crops. Among them was Seah Eu Chin. Legal documents show his family may have owned most of the areas in the Caldecott district at different points in history, and lived in the area. In fact, the Seah family had built two large bungalows there, one of which was called E Choon, where a grand ball was held for prominent Europeans and Chinese guests. This attracted great attention because it was the first time a large gathering of Europeans and Chinese participated in a grand ball within a Chinese setting.
An interesting story has been told of how Seah Eu Chin's son, Seah Liang Seah, reportedly shot and killed an eight-feet long alligator, who had been taking swims in the family pool and feasting on the fish in their pond. During this time, tiger sightings in other plantations along Thomson Road were also common, and livestock and coolies were known to be carried away by these felines.
Revamping Public Housing
In 1935, there was increased confidence in the real estate business in Singapore, boosted by a demand for cheap modern houses. Local based firm, Fogden. Brisbane and Co. Ltd. mooted the idea of building a large number of suburban houses on Caldecott Hill, to be rented out as affordable housing. Fogden and Brisbane were at this time one of the four biggest development firms in Malaya, and they had the resources to invest in the undertaking.
When completed in 1937, the local newspapers reported that Caldecott Hill Estate was the latest â€œmodern homeâ€, replete with perks such as electricity, piped water and modern sanitation facilities. The last item, in particular, was still a novelty for most houses in Singapore at that time. Many were still using the â€œNight Bucketâ€ (night-soil bucket) system.
Radio Through the War
Caldecott Hill saw further transformations with the building of Singapore's first permanent radio broadcasting station, which was built on Caldecott Hill and opened in 1937. At the first regular broadcast at its opening, then-Governor Sir Shenton Thomas described the interior of the broadcasting station â€“ the sound proof studios with air-conditioning, and rooms for performers, announcer and control engineer. In the years following its opening, the Government established the Malaya Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) and made plans to develop it. However, the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945 was a disruption to plans to develop the MBC.
When the war came in 1942, it was said that the battle lines stopped right at the edge of Caldecott Hill Estate. The broadcasting station survived the battle and it was used by the Japanese during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore in World War II.
Lights, Camera, Action!
After the war, only 41 houses in Caldecott Hill Estate survived. The area continued to be a residential estate. By the 1990s, the area had become a premier private housing estate, save for the Caldecott Broadcast Centre.
From radio to TV, the broadcast station at Caldecott Hill was inextricably linked to the blossoming of Singapore's media scene. Radio-Television Singapore, the predecessor to today's Mediacorp, opened its new Television Studio Centre in 1966, an event graced by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1966, and it is the predecessor to today's MediaCorp, In December 2015, MediaCorp made its move from the Caldecott Broadcast Centre in Andrew Road, which had been its home for the past 63 years, to its new home at Mediapolis in One-North.

After Dr Tan Tsze Chor â€“ a businessman, calligrapher, and generous supporter of the arts â€“ died in 1983, the family donated over 100 works to the Asian Civilisations Museum in early 2000 and grew an art fund in his name.
At the Asian Civilisations Museum, Mr Tan Gek Gnee remembers the passion with which his father, Dr Tan Tsze Chor, collected these works of Chinese art. Photo Credit: Annabelle Liang
Being an avid collector of Chinese art, the late Dr Tan Tsze Chor regularly hosted dinner parties at home. The property had to be dressed to entertain. This was a task for his son, Mr Tan Gek Gnee. Growing up, Mr Tan was regularly handed a list of paintings that needed to be displayed.
â€œI would search for them and hang them on the walls in our gallery,â€ Mr Tan said. â€œMy father would inspect how the paintings were hung. The height and distance between them had to be correct. More importantly, they needed to look pleasant to the eye,â€ he added.
â€œThat was how detailed and serious his character was, whether with work or his love for art,â€ Mr Tan, who is now in his 60s, explained.
Simple beginnings
Dr Tan was born in Singapore in 1911. He returned to China with his parents in 1917 for his studies, but made another trip to the city-state years later to find work.
At hardly 16 years of age, Dr Tan found a job as a peon. That was when he grew interested in calligraphy. At night, he religiously practised writing, using newspapers because he could get them for free.
â€œMy father told me that when you make a mistake while painting, you can correct it by covering the area with another colour or pattern,â€ Mr Tan said.
â€œBut with calligraphy, if a dot or stroke is too thick, it is not possible to correct the mistake because the word will look awkward,â€ he added.
Dr Tan slowly carved a name for himself at work and in the realm of art. He became a successful Teochew businessman, dealing with pepper, gambier, rubber, coffee, and other local produce.
Dr Tan's calligraphy was exhibited in Singapore and Taiwan.
Getting to know artists
Dr Tan frequently reached out to artists, to get a better understanding of their paintings. He made friends with Chinese artists like Xu Beihong, Qi Baishi, Zhang Daqian, and Huang Binhong.
His collection and studio, named Xiang Xue Zhuang, had valuable masterpieces by Xu, Qi, Ren Yi, and Pan Tianshou, among others. The name Xiang Xue Zhuang was an allusion to the fragrance of the plum blossom.
At its peak between the 1950s and 1980s, there were over a few hundred objects in the collection. This included paintings, commissioned portraits of Dr Tan and his wife, porcelains, and other objects.
While most items were brought to his attention, Dr Tan would buy high quality ceramics from New York and London.
When Mr Tan and his siblings were born, Dr Tan doted on them and regularly took his family to the movies and to restaurants for dinner. He continued to practise calligraphy twice a week.
Mr Tan recalled making folds on rice paper so his father could write weekly. â€œHis calligraphy has its own style. When people see it, they know straight away that it is the work of Dr Tan Tsze Chor,â€ Mr Tan said.
In 1977, Dr Tan worked with the Singapore Art Society to set up the Tan Tsze Chor Art Fund, to support the development of local art and artists.
In recognition of his contribution to the arts, Dr Tan was conferred an honorary doctorate by the Hua Gang College of Chinese Culture, part of the present-day Chinese Culture University in Taiwan.
Mr Tan Tsze Chor passed away in 1983.
Valuable gifts of art
Since 2000, the Tan family has donated over 100 works from Dr Tan's collection to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM). They also donated close to 500 volumes from Dr Tan's collection of books on Chinese art to the ACM library.
In 2003 to 2004, an exhibition of the paintings and ceramics given by the family of Dr Tan Tsze Chor was presented at ACM's premises in Armenian Street. A gallery was also named in Dr Tan's honour.
To mark the publication of the Xiang Xue Zhuang Collection catalogue, a display of objects from the collection was held at the Tan Tsze Chor ACM from 2006 to 2007.
After Dr Tan's death, the Tan family agreed to grow the Tan Tsze Chor Art Fund. At that time, the money was put in a bank. Any interest it garnered was offered as prize money at a yearly art competition.
They grew the fund significantly and decided to invest in equities to get a better rate of return.
â€œWe hope to invest wisely and build up the fund, so that we will be able to increase the prize money in the future,â€ Mr Tan said.
Mr Tan is currently the Managing Director of Chiang Hong Private Limited, a company that his father started. Over the years, it has veered off distributing food items and now deals with investments instead.
â€œBecause my father was a perfectionist, being his right-hand man, I have learned to follow in his footsteps,â€ Mr Tan shared.
Among the items, a painting of horses by Xu Beihong and a set of his father's calligraphic works are Mr Tan's favourites.
â€œOur family wanted to honour our father and decided to donate the best of his Chinese art collection to ACM,â€ Mr Tan said. â€œThe objective was to carry on his legacy of promoting Chinese works of art, by sharing his art collection with the general public.â€
Mr Tan hopes the collection will speak to Singaporeans and especially the young.
â€œGood design sells products from cars to houses, furniture, and phones. We hope that young artistic minds will be stimulated, once they have the opportunity to study beautiful artworks on display in the museums,â€ Mr Tan said.

Lim Bo Seng (27 April 1909â€“29 June 1944) might have been tortured by the Japanese for days on end, but it was having to leave his family behind for their own safety that tore at the heart and spirit of the father of eight.
Portrait of Lim Bo Seng (c1941â€“1944. Image from the Lim Leong Geok Collection, National Archives of Singapore)
Lim Bo Seng, the first son of contractor Lim Loh, was born in a 99-room family housing complex in Fujian's Nan'an County in China.1 He left for Singapore at 16 and studied at the prestigious Raffles Institution2 where he was classmates with individuals such as Yusof Ishak, the future president of Singapore.3
In 1929, Lim cut short his studies at the University of Hong Kong to take over his father's businesses, one of which was a well-known construction company involved in the erection of major landmarks such as Goodwood Park Hotel, Victoria Memorial Hall and Old Parliament House.4 Lim's business acumen put him in good stead to manage and grow his father's businesses. As a result he also became a prominent merchant.5 On top of this, Lim served in key positions in a number of associations such as the Singapore Contractors Association, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Singapore Hokkien Association.6
Lim married teacher Gan Choo Neo in 1930.7 She bore him eight children, one of whom died at a young age.8 He was a loving father, taking his children to High Street on weekends to read and buy books at Ensign Bookshop before adjourning to Polar Cafe for cake and ice cream.9
When war broke out in China, Lim stepped forward and took on an active role in resisting Japanese advances, earning himself a distinguished place in history as one of Malaya's foremost war heroes. But his anti-war efforts required great sacrifice. When Singapore fell to the Japanese, Lim found himself having little choice but to separate from his beloved family.
Clandestine missions
Lim's anti-war efforts, where he organised fundraisers and protests, began in the 1930s, before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese war.
In December 1941, Japanese troops infiltrated Kota Bharu in Malaya in an amphibious attack. Alarmed, the British called on Lim to help bolster Singapore's defence infrastructure. As head of Labour Services of the Overseas Chinese Mobilisation Council, he gathered 10,000 men to erect defences, run key services for the population, and blow up the Causeway â€” a means in which the Japanese could storm Singapore.
With the Japanese on Singapore's doorstep, arrangements were made for Lim and his family to leave for their safety. However, with the Japanese sinking evacuating vessels, Lim made the call to have them stay on in Singapore, choosing instead to leave their side.
In a diary entry dated 11 February 1942, just days before the fall of Singapore, Lim wrote that the decision to separate pained him greatly. â€œTo leave the dear Mrs behind at the mercy of the enemy would go very hard against my own conscience. On the other hand, to remain with the family in the event of enemy occupation, would not in any way improve the situation but my presence may even make their lot very much harder.â€
He added that his children were ""too stupefied to realise what was happeningâ€ as they kissed him goodbye. â€œI shall never forget the tear-stained faces as long as I live. If there is anything I could do to make up for what they were then going through, I shall not spare myself to carry it out.â€ It was the last time he would see them. .
Lim left soon after by sampan, observing in his diary that the sky was lit up by enemy fire in three directions â€” Pasir Panjang, Serangoon and Bukit Timah.10 By morning, Singapore was â€œenveloped in a pall of smokeâ€.
Lim eventually found his way to India, joining Force 136, a secret service unit established by the British and Chinese governments to recapture Singapore.11 He was responsible for recruiting Chinese espionage agents who could blend in with locals to gather intelligence.12
Upon completion of their training, teams from Force 136 boarded a Dutch submarine from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to re-enter the Japanese controlled territory of Malaya.13 Lim was among them. While in Malaya, Force 136 attempted to collaborate with the area's main resistance movement, the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army. It also set up a covert network to gather intelligence.14
Later, following some blunders and a betrayal, information was divulged to the Japanese which led to the arrests of Force 136 agents. Lim, who had left the group's Bukit Bidor camp to raise funds and expand its intelligence network, was also arrested.15
Lim was mercilessly starved and tortured for information by Japanese military police at the Batu Gajah Gaol where he was incarcerated. They failed to break him. Despite his own plight, Lim shared his meagre food rations with fellow prisoners. Compatriots who witnessed his last days in prison said he had been ""reduced to a bag of bones"".16 He eventually died of malnutrition, dysentery and torture at 35.17 Wrapped in a tattered blanket, he was taken away in a wooden cart and buried in a mass grave near the prison grounds.18
A hero's return
In Singapore, the Japanese who were baying for blood, were successful in hunting down and killing eight of Lim's relatives living at 855 Serangoon Road â€” a compound comprising three houses built by Lim Loh.19 Lim's wife, however, managed to outwit them, moving her family from one hideout to another. At one point, she even sought refuge at St John's Island.20
Following his unceremonious burial in Batu Gajah, Lim's remains were brought back to Singapore.21 After a funeral at City Hall, he was laid to rest with full military honours on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir where he used to court his wife.22 He was posthumously awarded the rank of major-general by the Chinese Nationalist government in 1946.

On the 10th anniversary of his death, a memorial built in his honour was unveiled at Esplanade Park. It is the only World War II memorial in Singapore dedicated to an individual. It was gazetted a national monument in 2010 alongside two other structures in the park.
In 2016, Lim's personal diary which he left behind for his heartbroken wife, resurfaced. One entry reads: â€œYou must not grieve for me. On the other hand, you should take pride in my sacrifice and devote yourself to the upbringing of the children. Tell them what happened to me and direct them along my footsteps.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/p-ramlee/story,"TL;DR
P Ramlee was an actor, singer, songwriter and director whose star shone brightly during the golden age of Malay films, earning him fans in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The entertainer died at 44 from a heart attack but by then had acted in 66 films, directed 35, and composed 250 songs.1 His popularity stemmed from his ability to reflect the issues and concerns of his time, offering viewers a mirror to examine themselves and their place in a changing world.
Watch: Roots.SG Presents: The Golden Era P. Ramlee
  An early interest in music
P. Ramlee (22 March 1929 - 29 May 1973) was born Teuku Zakaria to a Penang-born woman and a sailor from Aceh, Indonesia.
He grew up in Penang where he studied at Sekolah Melayu Kampung Jawa (Kampung Jawa Malay School), the Francis Light English School, as well as the Penang Free School. The name Ramlee had been used to register him for classes.
Ramlee much preferred music to school. When the Japanese invasion disrupted his school life, Ramlee, then 13, pounced at the chance to focus more on it. Over the course of the war, he picked up the basics of music, joined his village band, Teruna Sekampung, and even learned how to sing in Japanese.2 After the war concluded, he signed up for lessons to read musical notations.
At 16, a more confident Ramlee participated in a singing competition organised by Penang Radio for contestants in North Malaya. He participated in the contest three years in a row before emerging top on his third attempt in 1947.3 It was during this period that he added the initial initial â€œP.â€ (for â€œPutehâ€) to his name.
As luck would have it, Ramlee was talent-spotted by B. S. Rajhans, a director working with Shaw Brothers, while singing at a keroncong show in Penang in 1948.4 He was invited to join the studio's Malay Film Productions arm to record songs for soundtracks and lip-synching actors. Ramlee accepted the offer, leaving Penang for Singapore with his violin in 1949. As part of his audition, he sang his first composition Azizah, after an unfulfilled romance,5 at a studio located on Jalan Ampas off Balestier Road.6

During his early days with the studio, Ramlee took on work as a clapper boy and assistant cameraman, attesting to his down-to-earth nature.7 The Shaws, however, could tell that he had star power and did not keep him in the wings for long. Ramlee, after all, was a rare talent who could sing beautifully and act well. In 1950, he made his debut as a leading man in the films Bakti (Devotion) and Takdir Ilahi (Will of God, 1950).
Audiences were captivated by the charismatic actor, particularly for his ability to represent tensions between kampung and urban life.8 Known for his ability to pack movie theatres, Ramlee was reportedly paid $30,000 per film and had his fair share of super fans.9, 10
During a brief lull in his career, Ramlee spent some time in Johor Bahru, Malaya before rejoining the Shaws' Malay Film Productions to star in Penghidupan (Life) which was released in May 1951. He was also involved in a string of other films.
When he was 26, the Shaws gave Ramlee his directorial break. The appointment was a significant milestone for Malay film as it helped the industry break away from the influence of Indian cinema.11 Malay movies had up till that point been directed by Indian directors.12
Ramlee proved to be as talented a director as he was an actor. His various directorial efforts, many of which dealt with universal themes,13 earned him regional acclaim. Run Run Shaw, the co-founder of Shaw Studio, had a fairly close working relationship with Ramlee, and the pair were said to have attended film festivals together.14
Ramlee's best known works might have been Huah Tuah (1956), Musang Berjanggut (The Bearded Fox, 1959) and Madu Tiga (The Three Wives, 1964),15 but it was his comedic roles, such as in the series Bujang Lapok where he delighted audiences as a happy-go-lucky bachelor, or in Labu dan Labi (1962) where he played a bumbling servant, which endeared him the most to audiences.16
Ramlee, who married thrice in his lifetime, also tried his hand at directing theatrical productions. Kachip Mas (1961), for instance, was one such production which ran at Victoria Theatre as well as amusement parks Happy World and New World.
P. Ramlee's third wife, singer-actress Salmah binti Ismail whose stage name was Saloma.
In 1964, Ramlee joined the Shaws' Merdeka Film Productions in Malaysia where he made a number of films before the studio wound down in 1977.17
Away from the big screen, Ramlee's talents as a vocalist were sought after by recording companies such as Hemsley & Co., and His Master's Voice (HMV). At Hemsley & Co., Ramlee's composition Azizah took flight, earning him an honorarium. Meanwhile, the region's airwaves were graced by Ramlee's melodic vocals via Radio Malaya broadcasts as part of his involvement with HMV.18

Remembering the showman
The prolific showman's life was cut short after suffering from a heart attack at 44. He was buried at the Jalan Ampang Muslim Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Halls, museums and buildings have been named in his honour. For instance, Caunter Hall, the road he was born on in Penang, was renamed Jalan P. Ramlee. The kampung house he grew up in was also restored. In Malaysia, two memorials have been dedicated to the late star.
In 1990, Ramlee was posthumously conferred the honorific title of Tan Sri.

In February 1942, Lieutenant Adnan Saidi led a small group of fighters against a 13,000-strong, battle-hardened Japanese force hell bent on capturing Singapore1. Despite the odds stacked against them, they held their ground for three days, momentarily thwarting the veteran army's plans.
More than a year into work as a trainee teacher in his hometown of Kajang in Selangor, Malaysia, 18-year-old Adnan Saidi made the life-changing decision to switch careers by joining a military unit specially established for Malays.
The year was 1933 and the unit, which came to be known as the Malay Regiment, had been set up by the British to provide employment opportunities for young Malay men2. Its initial recruitment drive attracted 1,000 candidates of whom 25 were selected.3
Adnan proved to be the Regiment's most outstanding enlistee, picking up its best recruit award in 1934.4 Along the way, he became a company officer, and was selected to march in a parade in London to honour King George VI's ascension to the throne.
In 1939, as a brutal war unfolded in Europe, the Regiment began ramping up training exercises. Two years later, amid the rumblings of an impending war in the Far East, Adnan took up a post in Singapore, bringing along his pregnant wife, Sophia Pakih Muda, a teacher by vocation, and two sons. They lived in a house off Pasir Panjang designated for Malay Regiment officers.5

This arrangement, however, was short-lived. As air raids increased in frequency, Adnan sent his children and wife home to Selangor by train. They said their goodbyes at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, with the boys kissing their father's hand.6 It was the last they would see of each other. According to the recollections of older son Mokhtar, Adnan told them to take care of themselves and be good. â€œI didn't know it would be the last time I would see my father,â€ Mokhtar is recorded as having said. â€œI was only three years old, but I [can] still remember his face.â€7

On 8 December 1941, about an hour before the notorious Japanese attack of Pearl Harbour on the other side of the world, General Tomoyuki Yamashita's men began their invasion of Southeast Asia via the coast of a sleepy fishing village in Kota Bharu, northern Malaya.8 Battle-hardened Japanese troops, commandeering stolen bicycles, made their way on bicycles and motor vehicles into Singapore through the western flank of the Malay Peninsula.9 From 8 to 15 February 1942, the army stunned and overwhelmed Singapore's defences.
One of the fiercest battles leading up to the fall of Singapore took place at Pasir Panjang Ridge which comprised key military installations such as the British Military Hospital, as well as ammunition and supply depots.
The Japanese had spent the morning of 13 February 1942 inundating the Malay Regiment held area with gunfire and bombs.10 Together with his men, Adnan, a company officer of the 7th Platoon in C Company, was tasked with holding down the fort. Positioned along Reformatory Road11, they were successful in keeping the Japanese's 18th Division at bay.12
By midnight, Adnan's company was instructed to regroup at Opium Hill.13 There, Adnan ordered his men to place sandbags around the site to buy themselves time.14 By early afternoon on 14 February, rather desperate members of the Japanese Imperial Army spotting turbans, tried to sneak onto the hill disguised as Sikh members of the British Indian Army. Their attempt to gain ground was foiled by Adnan and 2nd Lieutenant Abbas bin Abdul Manan who noticed they were marching in formations of four instead of three.15 Adnan ordered his men to fire at them. In all, 22 enemy soldiers were killed leading to their momentary retreat.
Two hours later, the Japanese returned with a vengeance. Thousands of soldiers equipped with ample fire power swarmed the site. Despite the heavy shelling, the company held on. When their bullets ran out, they charged at the Japanese, fighting them with only their bayonets and their bare hands.16
The Japanese then had survivors like the badly wounded Adnan executed. Placed in a gunny sack, he was hung upside down from a cherry tree and ruthlessly stabbed to death.17
That was not the end of it. Thirsty for blood, the enemy forces sought out Adnan's family. To protect themselves, they rid their home of his belongings.
Wrecked by the news of her husband's death, Adnan's wife was said to have clammed up whenever her children asked her about him.
For his valour, the British awarded Adnan posthumous campaign medals.18 In Singapore, Adnan and his men are remembered at a museum called Reflections at Bukit Chandu which opened in 2002. The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance at the museum, which reopened in 2021 after a revamp, is a rare and moving clip of Adnan training his troops. It is also at this very site that his values, including his motto, â€œbiar putih tulang, jangan putih mataâ€ (better to die than to live in shame in Malay) live on.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Dalforce-Dalleys-Desperadoes/story,"One of the military units that defended Singapore from the Japanese was a group of Chinese volunteers with barely any training or weapons.
Cheng Seang Ho was not a typical soldier. She was a 66 year-old grandmother. However, on 11 February 1942, she fought fiercely in the Battle of Bukit Timah, firing a shotgun at the Japanese invaders, taking shelter with her husband behind a row of blasted tree stumps.
She was part of a small army called Dalforce. Her fellow soldiers came from all walks of life. They included students, labourers, office workers, secret society members, rickshaw pullers, and dancing girls from nightclubs. Many were members of the Malayan Communist Party. They had been released from prison, just so that they could fight to defend Singapore.
The British had recruited their army only a month earlier, in January. Before that, they had not trusted the Chinese enough to defend Singapore. Instead, they had decided to mainly use soldiers from other parts of the British empire, such as Australia and India.
These stills of Chinese volunteers in Singapore are from a 1941 British PathÃ© newsreel, which is available on YouTube. Source: British PathÃ©
However, as soon as they made a call for Chinese volunteers, thousands of people turned up. Not all of them were from Singapore. Some from Malaya crossed the Causeway just so they could help with the war effort. Around 3,000 people were recruited, although only about 1,250 were actually enlisted into training.
The Chinese called this army â€œthe Singapore Overseas Chinese Volunteer Armyâ€ (æ˜ŸåŽä¹‰å‹‡å†›). The British called it Dalforce, using the name of the commander, John Dalley, a lieutenant colonel from the police. He had been trying to convince the government to form this army from way back in 1940.
Now, there was no time to prepare these new soldiers properly. They were only given three to 14 days of training in basic military skills. On 5 February, they were sent into action, wearing blue uniforms, with red triangles on their right sleeves.
The soldiers were extremely poorly equipped. They had no helmets, so they wrapped yellow cloths around their heads. They also had very few weapons: long knives called parangs, shotguns and hunting rifles, some with as few as seven bullets. They were not even given enough food supplies.
Nevertheless, they impressed the full-time soldiers from Australia and the United Kingdom with their toughness and bravery. In Kranji, one unit battled against a Japanese machine-gun battalion until all 200 of them were killed. In contrast, an Australian unit retreated from the location, even though it was armed with machine guns.
There are unconfirmed stories that they managed to sink several rubber rafts which the Japanese used to travel from Malaya. General Yamashita actually considered stopping the invasion on 10 February, because the resistance was so strong.
Dalforce member Teo Choon Hong later explained to researchers why he had fought so desperately. â€œI didn't think I would be safe behind the line,â€ he said. â€œSince it wasn't safe, I might as well go to the front to resist them, to fight them. If I could kill one Japanese my sacrifice would be rewarded.â€
Sadly, these heroes could not change the course of the war. On 13 February, Lieutenant Colonel Dalley gathered them at headquarters and announced that the British government had decided to stop fighting. He paid each of the volunteers $10 and made them give up their weapons. He then ordered the weapons to be buried.
300 Dalforce soldiers were killed in the battles. Many more would be slaughtered by the Japanese during the Occupation, including Madam Cheng's husband. Some of them continued to fight secretly in the jungles as part of the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army.
Madam Cheng herself survived the war. In 1957, she attended the opening ceremony of the Kranji War Memorial. She refused to wait for the British Governor to lay down his flowers, and walked in front of him instead, so she could mourn her husband and her fellow soldiers.

Ho Seng Choon - Poultry Farmer
He foresaw the importance of farming in the 1950s and when farmers were still reliant on traditional methods of farming, he pushed to modernise farming. Mr Ho is an industry pioneer and an industry leader. Through his long career as a farmer, he has championed the cause of farmers and worked to share his knowledge and experience with the farming community.
The modernity of Singapore today may have led us to forget that farming was once a major economic activity in rural areas such as Choa Chu Kang, Seletar, Jurong and Punggol. In the late 1950s, local farms were able to meet the needs of the island's population of 1.6 million people, despite poor soil conditions and traditional farming methods. By the late 1960s, Singapore had 20,000 farms occupying 14,000 hectares.
89-year-old Mr. Ho Seng Choon is a pioneer in Singapore's poultry sector. Born in Fujian Province in China, Ho moved to Singapore in 1929 where his father ran a provision shop in Chinatown. After World War 2, Ho saw potential in poultry farming and travelled abroad to learn the latest methods in livestock breeding and production.
Through continuous innovation, Seng Choon overcame constraints in land, and raised productivity in poultry farming. Today, the sole proprietorship has grown into a conglomerate with farms in Singapore and Johor and retail lines for battery systems and feed mills, husbandry consultancy and education. Ho's youngest son has taken over the reins of the business while he enjoys retirement.

Runtik Binti Murtono - Urut Lady
Since moving to Singapore in 1994, Ibu Tutik's work as an Urut Lady has helped her support her family in Singapore as well as in Surabaya. Demand for her services was particularly high in the Chinese Dragon year of 2012. That year alone, she took care of 600 new mummies. Ibu Tutik enjoys her work and is happy that at 52 years old she is still strong and able to continue working.
In the past, maternity clinics and modern hospitals were hard to come by. Many women thus relied on the skills of a bidan or Malay midwife, who drew upon her knowledge of traditional post-natal rituals to help ease the discomfort of new mothers.
One of the skills wielded by a bidan to restore new mothers to health and shapeliness is urut, or traditional massage techniques. The practice of post-natal jamu massages and benkung has its origins in Indian Ayurvedic traditions, which spread to Southeast Asia via Java. Rarely captured in writing, the art of the bidan was handed down orally from mother to daughter over generations, and each family of healers would maintain their secret techniques and mixes for the poultice of jamu.
To this day, urut remains a popular treatment during the confinement period. One of the leading practitioners of this craft is 53-year-old Madam Runtia Binte Murtono, also known as Ibu Tutik to her clients. She has been massaging and â€œwrappingâ€ new mothers back to health and shapeliness for more than 35 years. Born in Indonesia to a family of traditional midwives and jamu healers, Ibu Tutik trained under her mother. In 1994 Ibu Tutik came to Singapore, where she began to earn a living as an Urut Lady, making house calls to all corners of the island from her home in Sengkang. She counts mothers of many races amongst her clients.

Thangaraju s/o Singaram - Letter Writer
At 85 years old, Mr. Thangaraju is healthy and spends his days attending to customers at his son-in-law's shop in Little India to keep himself active. It has been more than 60 years ago when he first arrived in Singapore to look for work; instead he has found a home. His children are Singapore citizens, and enjoyed opportunities for higher education and careers that he himself had sought. Now a grandfather, the story of the Tamil immigrant is one of tenacity and optimism. His positive attitude towards hard work and contributing to those in need of help has helped him build a life and a home in Singapore.
Back when long-distance phone calls were a rare luxury, handwritten letters were the only affordable means of communication between families separated by oceans. Few immigrants could read or write then, so they turned to individuals such as Mr. Thangaraju s/o Singaram to help them craft messages to relatives back home.
Thangaraju, who arrived in Singapore in 1951 from South India, had the rare privilege of formal schooling. Hence, he found himself writing letters for immigrants who shared his quarters in Little India. On weekends or public holidays, Thangaraju would sit over a cup of tea with his clients, mostly older men who did hard labour for a living, and read to them or pen down what they wanted to tell their kinsfolk in Tamil Nadu. His own experience as an immigrant added empathy to his penmanship and Thangaraju would assume the role of mediator and counsellor, softening harsh words and helping to resolve misunderstandings between far-apart spouses or siblings.
By the 1970s however, most older immigrants had passed away or moved back to their homeland, and newer immigrants were usually educated enough to compose their own letters. That spelt the end of Thangaraju's letter-writing days.

Ng Moey Chye - Samsui Woman
At 81 years old, Ms. Ng does not allow her age to slow her down. She continues to support herself by collecting used cardboard, and once a week she will make her way to the Apex Club of Singapore's food distribution point to receive a package that includes vegetable and bread. She prefers to see the silver linings in her life and is grateful for her health and the young volunteers for helping the elderly. â€œSociety still has a heart,â€ she says.
It may be hard to imagine 81-year-old Ms. Ng Moey Chye carting bricks up a construction site. In her younger days, however, Ng would awake at dawn and walk from her quarters at Chinatown to Collyer Quay. There, she would carry out a multitude of tasks that is typically carried out by heavy machinery today at construction sites across Singapore.
Born in Singapore in 1932, Ng was given up for adoption by her parents and never went to school. After witnessing the unhappy marriage of a childhood friend, Ng chose to become a Samsui woman, prizing her independence above everything else.
Samsui women were so-called as the movement originated from the county of Sanshui (Samsui in Cantonese) in Guangdong Province, where women dominated the workforce during a silk industry boom in the mid-19th century. Wearing a distinctive red headscarf or hong toujin (çº¢å¤´å·¾), the Samsui women were a sisterhood of mainly Cantonese or Hakka women who took a vow of chastity and supported themselves through manual labour.

Ang Hao Sai - Poster Painter
He turned his skill to commercial art jobs just as the movie poster painting industry was declining. His ability to seize business opportunities when they came and his courage to adapt to changes have kept Hao Meng Art Studio growing into the second generation.
Ever wondered about the artist behind the lifelike painted posters advertising upcoming blockbusters of the silver screen? Born in Singapore, Mr. Ang Hao Sai was one such artisan whose excellent brushwork created these extravagant works of art. Displaying an early talent for art, Ang left school after Primary 6 to become an apprentice at a poster studio.
Ang eventually became the studio's master painter, tasked to work on sections requiring fine detail such as the faces of movie characters. At its peak, painters worked in assembly-line shifts producing up to 50 posters each time.
After the studio closed down in the 1980s, Ang launched his own poster painting business in 1987. In keeping with the changing times, Ang also branched out to commercial projects such as signages and props. This plan later expanded into a major business involving the building and painting of stage backdrops. Over time, as the cost of labour rose and new printing technologies became readily available, Ang switched to inkjet printing of photo-real posters as the promotion of new films shifted from large billboards to online platforms. The family business continues to thrive today because of Ang's foresight and quick adaptation to change. Today, he remains actively involved in his business.

Murugaian s/o Ratnaswami Asari â€“ Goldsmith
He saw the potential of the goldsmith trade and decided to train to become a goldsmith. He worked hard and saved up to start his own goldsmith shop, Indian Jewellers. Although a stroke has affected his movement, the 72-year old has not allowed his condition to slow him down. He started his second shop RMP Jewellers & Goldsmith in 2009, and still remains active in the business.
Mr. Murugaian was just 16 years old when he left South India for Singapore in 1957, to work as an apprentice under a master goldsmith.
Through hard work and determination, Murugaian established RMP Jewellers & Goldsmith located in Little India. The shop is testament of his dedication to a lifetime of traditional jewellery-making - first in the workshops of master goldsmiths and later, at Murugaian's own premises. In the 1950s, large numbers of Indian goldsmiths arrived in Singapore and turned the area around Buffalo Road into a hub for traditional jewellery. Discerning Chinese ladies as well as Indian families desiring customized jewellery for wedding ceremonies counted amongst their regular customers.
Now too old and frail to make the jewellery himself, Murugaian oversees two craftsmen who create customised necklaces, bracelets, armlets, rings and hair ornaments for long-time customers. Today, RMP Jewellers & Goldsmith is one of the two makers of handcrafted jewellery left in Little India.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/jurong-industrial-estate/story,"TL;DR
The air is thick with the aroma of toasty biscuits, freshly roasted cocoa from chocolate factories, and the occasional waft of chemicals and exhaust.1 Trucks rattle along ferrying local produce such as eggs and bottles of soya sauce.2
You're in Jurong, Singapore's primary production hub churning out a slew of products from food to electronics and pharmaceuticals. Getting here â€” not just your commute, but the journey undertaken by early city planners â€” was no mean feat. It involved redeveloping swamp land, building factories, roads and amenities from scratch, and of course convincing workers to relocate to the â€œboondocksâ€. How did everything fall into place?
Building factories on a crocodile-infested swamp

A remote swamp with crocodile-infested waterways â€” the last place on anyone's mind â€” transformed into a thriving industrial hub. Jurong, one of the most ambitious projects of modern Singapore, was materialised through foresight, determination and ingenuity.
Initiated by Dutch economist Albert Winsemius and Singapore's minister of finance Goh Keng Swee, the plan to build Jurong Industrial Estate was born out of necessity as a result of Singapore's high unemployment rate.3
As of 1959, an estimated 200,000 people, or 14% of the population were jobless. With the impending decline of entrepot trade and other economic factors at play, the issue of unemployment was expected to worsen as the population grew.4
Goh's Folly?
Sceptics scoffed at the pair's plan â€” few could see rural Jurong's potential. The project also seemed too costly. Reclamation, infrastructural work and the like would cost a staggering $100 million.5
And while there was a smattering of factories in Jurong, including one which produced canned kaya and curries, Singapore by and large had very little experience in manufacturing.6 In addition, observers felt that investors had little risk appetite to set up shop in Singapore following a spate of labour strikes.
Initial hiccups seemed to prove the sceptics right, as few investors took bait when the estate became ready for production in 1963 after 1.8 million cubic metres of earth had been moved.7 Critics thus named the endeavour ""Goh's Folly"".
Dr Goh persisted with the project anyway. He rolled out a few initiatives to lure investors. These included:
the provision of generous tax incentives;

ready-made factory spaces and infrastructure for companies to launch production;

the promise of a stable labour climate via sound tripartite arrangements.

The Economic Development Board (EDB), established to helm Singapore's industrialisation drive, courted producers of joss sticks, wigs, garments, fertiliser, plywood, acid and animal feed. Despite their best efforts, the team only managed to secure two investors: NatSteel and Pelican Textiles.

One factory-related event per day for 90 days
Then Minister of Fnance Goh Keng Swee speaking at the inaugural Jurong Town Corporation board meeting in 1968. (Image from the National Archives Singapore)
To give his fledgling project a much-needed boost, Goh instructed the EDB to conduct opening ceremonies daily over a three-month period. This was impossible considering that less than 10 factories were ready to start production.8
To populate the calendar, grab news headlines and build hype, the EDB team got creative. It held ceremonies when investors signed agreements to start work in the estate, for groundbreaking ceremonies, as well as official opening ceremonies.
The Economic Development Board was tasked to launch events daily over a three-month period to declare to one and all that Jurong was open for business. (c. 1969. Image from the National Archives Singapore)
The tactic bore fruit, and by the end of the 1960s, 181 factories were in production. The project's success set the stage for subsequent chapters of industrial development in Jurong, with new investors in a wider variety of sectors streaming in steadily.9 Goh's ""Folly"" had become the nation's glory.
By 1969, Jurong Industrial Estate was home to 181 factories and a 20,000-strong workforce. (c.1960s)
Few takers for life in the â€œwild, wild westâ€
The path to success was bumpy to say the least, with accounts of Jurong in the early 1960s describing the roads as ""full of pot-holes, some deep enough to swallow a wheel"".10 It was a desolate area, ""hot and dusty"" with no trees or grass, and it was filled with mosquitoes. Workers also bemoaned the lack of recreational activities, save for leisurely walks to Jurong Lake.
To encourage the working community of Jurong to live where they worked, open-air cinemas were constructed while boats, which workers got to use for free on Sundays, were added to the lake.
Dr Goh also â€œcorneredâ€ companies into offering staff a housing allowance to incentivise them to move to Jurong. He would build a tollgate otherwise, he said, where buses and lorries ferrying workers would be charged $50 a month.
These measures were effective. Work on Jurong New Town began in the 1960s11 and by 1969, 16,000 people were living in flats and shophouses built by the Housing Development Board (HDB). The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), a specialised agency formed to develop and manage industrial estates, took over residential and industrial development for a period before the HDB returned in 1982 to handle and oversee the area's housing needs.
Low-cost flats were erected to attract people to live and work in Jurong. (c.1964. Image from Jurong Town Corporation)
The JTC was behind landmarks such as the diamond blocks of Taman Jurong at Yung Kuang Road where companies rented flats to house staff. The four blocks, completed by JTC in 1973, form a unique diamond footprint and have inner facing common corridors to foster a sense of community.12
Gradually, bus services, wet markets, food centres, clinics, community centres, retail areas, sport facilities, as well as public parks and gardens were added to the mix.
Other landmarks which rose in Jurong include Jurong Town Hall. Perched on a little hill, it served as JTC's headquarters from 1974 to 2000.13 Now a national monument, the geometrically outstanding building is emblematic of Singapore's successful industrialisation programme.
Jurong Town Hall, a landmark representing Singapore's confidence in its industrialisation ambitions. It served as the Jurong Town Corporation's headquarters for about a quarter of a century.14
By 1980, more than 110,000 people lived in JTC housing units in Taman Jurong, Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens and Pandan Gardens.
The addition of the Chinese Garden at Boon Lay Way added even more life and vibrancy to the district. Designed by Taiwanese architect Yu Yuen-Chen, and built between 1971 and 1975, it comprises bridges, pavilions and a pagoda inspired by classical northern Chinese imperial architecture. It was a popular spot for wedding photography during the 1970s and 1980s.
The Singapore Chinese Garden was commissioned to bolster Jurong's offerings. (c.1980s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
The Jurong of the future
Jurong's industrial activities are anchored by clusters such as CapitaLand's International Business Park and JTC's Jurong Innovation District which host a diverse and flourishing ecosystem of international and local corporations.15
To spur the country's next phase of economic transformation, a 360-hectare site in Jurong has been earmarked as Singapore's next â€œCentral Business Districtâ€ for sectors such as maritime, energy and IT. Announced in 2017, the Jurong Lake District project will be developed over the next few decades and is expected to generate more than 100,000 jobs.16
The Jurong Lake District is also set to welcome a mini Marina Bay Sands arena which is slated to house hotels, attractions, eateries and shops.

Ahmad Ibrahim (12 May 1916â€“17 April 1999, Malaysia) was a titan of a lawyer who laid the legal groundwork for Singapore during its formative years. He is credited for drafting the Administration of Muslim Law Act â€” a landmark piece of legislation which continues to ground the lives and affairs of Muslims in Singapore today. He also spent a good part of his career in academia, shaping young minds, and building up Malaysia's legal fraternity.
A stellar student
Ahmad Ibrahim was intellectually ambitious from a young age, graduating from prestigious institutions such as Victoria Bridge School, Raffles Institution and Raffles College. In 1936, he was awarded the Queen's Scholarship to study at Cambridge University, passing the bar exams in London in 1940. While there, Ahmad even picked up the George Long Prize for Roman Law.1
Underlying Ahmad's cerebral gifts was a deep passion for the Malay Muslim community. His father, a medical practitioner active in Islamic social and welfare activities, could have had some bearing on this.2
Upon graduation, Ahmad would work to improve the community's status during the Republic of Singapore's formative years through activism, scholarly contributions, and his eventual role as a lawmaker. He was called to the bar in Singapore in 1941.
A prolific career
Ahmad rose quickly in the legal scene, despite disruptions in the early days of his career due to World War II. After three years in the civil service as a magistrate then district judge, he chalked up experience in private practice and as a law lecturer, before returning as deputy public prosecutor and senior crown counsel.
In and around 1949, Ahmad drafted the constitution of the Inter-religious Organisation which was established to maintain interfaith harmony. He was also one of its founding members.3 Just a year later, racial and religious riots broke out as a result of the heated Maria/Nadra Hertogh custody battle. In declaring her Islamic marriage illegal, Singapore's High Court drew the ire of members of the Muslim community.4 Ahmad had represented the man she was married to in a nikah gantung or truncated marriage.5
From 1959 to 1965, Ahmad took his seat as Singapore's first ever state advocate general, having been picked by merit for his intellect.6 He weighed in on critical merger talks with Malaysia.

Upon Singapore's independence, Ahmad became Singapore's first attorney-general. His legal mind was tapped by the law fraternity and government on a range of legal issues in administrative, property, finance and contract law. He was also involved in the drafting of the Women's Charter, Intestate Succession Act, and other statutes that serve as the basis for Singapore's legal system today.7
All this while, Ahmad, eager to improve the legal status of his community, studied Malay Muslim law avidly. He delved into the archives and produced extensive research on the legal history of Muslims in Southeast Asia, examining and comparing how Muslim law was administered historically in Malay states and in other countries in the region where it was not traditionally in practice.8
With such a depth of knowledge, Ahmad was the best man to formulate and draft the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) for Singapore â€” a task he poured his heart into. In advocating for Muslim laws to be folded into Singapore's legal framework, he valued and respected convention. However, he refused to allow tradition to get in the way of progress for the community. As such, he kept a keen eye on issues of equality as well as the protection of the vulnerable.
AMLA, which came into effect in 1968, deals with marriage and divorce matters, and also led to the establishment of Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). Muis, the Islamic religious council, guides the Muslim community and administers zakat (tithe), wakaf (endowment), pilgrimage affairs and the like.

AMLA stands as a piece of outstanding, landmark legislation given that Singapore is the only former British colony with a minority Muslim population to have such a law, and the only one with an Islamic religious council integrated within the state's legal structure.
Attesting to Ahmad's legal prowess, pioneer leader Goh Keng Swee described him as a man of â€œtremendous breadth and depth of intellect, whose ability as a legal draftsman is unsurpassed in this country"".9
Powerhouse of a professor
The last chapter of Ahmad's career was spent in academia. He moved to Malaysia and helped establish the country's first law faculty at the University of Malaya in 1972.
Not one to rest on his laurels, Ahmad moved around the country meeting leaders and administrators of Muslim law to keep abreast of issues. In his golden years, he continued to be in demand and worked the international conferences' and seminars' circuit.
He passed away from a heart attack in Malaysia on 17 April 1999 but his legacy lives on in the academic and legal papers â€” of which there are more than 200 â€” he wrote, as well as the laws he shaped.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/lest-we-forget/why-we-mark-wwii-each-year,"What's Up, Singapore's newspaper for students, spoke to Education Minister (Schools) Ng Chee Meng in 2018 about the importance of observing the anniversary of World War II.
What's Up: Unlike previous Education Ministers, you were born after independence, in 1968 â€” long after World War II. Did your parents or grandparents shared with you their personal stories of the Battle of Singapore and the Japanese Occupation?
Mr Ng: I remember my mum talking about the hardships of war. My grandfather went into hiding during Operation Sook Ching (a Japanese military operation where Chinese in Singapore were massacred). During this time, Chinese men between the ages of 18 and 50 were called to screening centres and executed. I never met my grandfather, but I heard about his experience through my mother.

My mother also talked about the hardships of day to day life. Most meals were made up of tapioca. Eating an egg was a luxury. Most significantly, she was very sad and lamented that she had missed out on the opportunity of getting an education. To support her family, she started working as a seamstress from a young age.

These stories left a deep impression on me. They had an impact for life. They made me realise the importance of Total Defence to keep Singapore safe. I heard these stories from my mother, and now it is our turn to share these stories with our children, so they, too, can understand the importance of keeping Singapore safe.

Singapore is safe today, but we cannot take peace for granted. We have peace in Singapore because we put a lot of effort into making that happen.
Ng Chee Meng was a general in the Singapore Armed Forces before he joined the government in 2015.

What's Up: You once led the Singapore Armed Forces as its Chief of Defence Force. Do you think Singapore is better able to defend itself now than in 1942?
Mr Ng: Absolutely. Firstly, we have better weapons. Most importantly, Singaporeans have the will to keep Singapore safe.

In 1942, we were not the most important piece in the British Empire's war strategy. â€œFortressâ€ Singapore was given second-rate weapons to defend itself. But when we became a nation-state, we made thea promise to stand up for ourselves. We decided to get better weapons and also train our sons, young Singaporeans,to protect ourselves. This has made all the difference.Standing up for ourselves is worth celebrating. This year, we mark 50 years of National Service.
It is terrible when one can't defend oneself and everything that matters to you. A war puts everything we love in danger â€”â€“ brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and, friends. You may be hearing or reading about what is happening in Iraq or to the children in Syria. We are happy that our neighbourhood is relatively peaceful. But we should never take peace for granted. We should always be prepared for the worst war - but always remember that our main aim is to keep peace.
What's Up: You've had several roles in the armed forces, most notably as an air force pilot. How best can the importance of defending Singapore be conveyed to those who may not serve National Service (such as women for instance) or work in the military?
Mr Ng: There are many ways to contribute to a stronger Singapore. There are five aspects to Total Defence. You can play a part in making sure that Singaporeans of all races get along and are kind and understanding toof one another; you can contribute to the country's economy so that we can do well together...â€¦ there are many ways for all of us to contribute to Singapore.
In fact I believe that a stronghold of society are our mothers. They strengthen the family, build relationships in communities, and nurture the young â€”â€“ these are all components of Total Defence.

Defence is not the domain of men alone. Our daughters will stand up for Singapore, and some have also chosen the military path.
What's Up: Singapore has changed so much since 1942. It is hard to imagine what it must have looked like during the Battle for Singapore. Is there any historic site which exists today that you think is the reminiscent of this period?
Mr Ng: The Former Ford Factory in Bukit Timah is one such building. This is where the British forces surrendered to the Japanese after the Battle for Singapore. But if I had to choose, I would choose Sentosa.

Sentosa was a military base during the Second World War, but the guns were facing south because the British expected the Japanese to invade from that direction. The Japanese took them by surprise when they entered from the north-western coastline. It's a good starting place to understand what went wrong with the British war strategy.

Sentosa was also a prisoner of war camp. During Operation Sook Ching, which I mentioned earlier, Chinese men suspected of being anti-Japanese were killed on its beach. There are many poignant lessons to be learnt here. To me it is a reminder of how important it is for Singaporeans to be at the top of our game, and to take Total Defence seriously, not just at war times, but in times of peace to ensure war never dawn upon Singapore.

World War Two came to Singapore when the first bombs were dropped on the island on 8 December 1941.1 61 people were killed and 133 others injured that day.2 This was followed by a swift Japanese invasion from the north two months later.3 Local forces and the British military were completely overwhelmed by the Japanese army and surrendered after just one week.4 Singapore was renamed Syonan-To, or Light of the South, during an occupation which lasted for three years and seven months.5

The end of an era
On Monday, 8 December 1941, the first bombs were dropped on Singapore. The flames of war had been raging across Europe and China, but the battle had not been expected to reach the island at the time. The British colony was touted as an impregnable fortress, so there was a confidence that even if attacked, it would not be overwhelmed.6
The events of that day shattered Singapore's air of confidence. Meanwhile, aware of the weak defences on the northern border, the Japanese planned an invasion from Johor, and the first soldiers set foot on the shores of Singapore exactly two months later, on 8 February 1942.7
The Battle for Singapore had begun. 
A ruthless and swift invasion
The first Japanese troops crossed the narrow Johor Strait on assault boats and barges, entering Singapore under the cover of darkness. The 22nd Australian Brigade guarding the northern coastline was overwhelmed in just two hours.8
The Japanese swiftly repaired the bombed causeway to provide troops with another point of entry into Singapore. (Image from National Archives of Singapore)
""When you encounter the enemy after landing, think of yourself as an avenger coming face to face at last with his father's murderer. Here is a man whose death will lighten your heart.""
â€“ Excerpt from a manual issued to Japanese troops in Southeast Asia.9
With ruthless determination, the Japanese then moved swiftly to capture Bukit Timah's petrol, oil, and supply depots from the Allies on 11 February 1942. The Ford Factory was turned into the headquarters of the commander of the Japanese 25th Army in Southeast Asia, General Tomoyuki Yamashita.10
Opium Hill â€“ Singapore's last line of defence
With Bukit Timah taken, allied troops were ordered to withdraw to the defensive perimeter along the city area, stretching from Pasir Panjang to Kallang. Among them were Lieutenant Adnan Saidi and the men of the â€œCâ€ Company, 1st Malay Brigade, who put up the fierce fight in what became known as the Battle of Opium Hill.11
â€œBiar putih tulang, jangang putih mata.â€ (Death before dishonour)
â€“Lt Adnan Saidi, 1st Malay Brigade, Battle of Opium Hill12
The Malay Regiment, led by Lieutenant Adnan Saidi, fought one of the fiercest battles against the Japanese in Singapore. (c.1941. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Forced to retreat to Bukit Chandu from Pasir Panjang Ridge with a platoon of only 42 soldiers,13 Lt Adnan and his men were heavily outnumbered. At one point during the battle, they  foiled an infiltration attempt by the Japanese, who were wearing captured British Army uniforms, by recognising that they were marching in a line of four columns, not the usual three columns typical of British troops. As the fighting dragged on and with ammunition ran running out, the men of ""C"" company engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. They were eventually overwhelmed but refused to surrender. Their commitment enraged the Japanese, who reportedly hung Lt Adnan upside down on a tree and stabbed him to death.14
After taking Bukit Chandu,15 the Japanese troops moved further inland, eventually reaching the British Military Hospital (now Alexandra Hospital). Despite being offered peaceful intent by a British officer, the Japanese soldiers rounded up about 260 staff and patients, and massacred them the next morning.16 After a discussion with his commanders at the Fort Canning Bunker (Battle Box), Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, the commanding officer of the British Commonwealth Forces in Malaya, officially surrendered Singapore to the Japanese at the Ford Factory. The date was 15 February 1942, just one week after the first Japanese troops landed in Singapore,17

Syonanâ€To â€” Light of the South18
In contrast to the name given to Singapore by the Japanese occupation, it was a dark three years and seven months19 for many on the island. The Sook Ching Massacre saw people suspected of being anti-Japanese executed along the beaches of Punggol, Changi, Katong, Tanah Merah and Blakang Mati (now Sentosa Island). Massacres were said to have also occured at Hougang, Thomson Road, Changi Road, Siglap, Bedok and East Coast. Due to a lack of written records, the exact number of people killed in the operation is unknown. The official figure given by the Japanese is 5,000, although the actual number is believed to much higher.20

Aside from the constant fear of persecution by the Kempeitai (Japanese military police),21 many living in Singapore during the occupation had to survive on limited food rations. The Japanese issued a new local currency, informally known as â€˜banana money', but hyperinflation caused its value to drop drastically, so that eventually almost nothing could be purchased with it.22 
Prisoners-of-war (POWs) were forced into hard labour and being imprisoned in cramped cells ridden with disease. They were also made to sign a pledge of non-escape, after four prisoners attempted to flee from Selarang camp. This was a violation of the Geneva Convention, which gave POWs the right to escape.23

Back to the Union Jack
As World War Two dragged on, the Japanese began to suffer numerous defeats in other parts of the world.24 Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Soviet Union's declaration of war in August, Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945, in Tokyo Bay on the American battleship USS Missouri, bringing an end to the war and their occupation of Singapore.25

Two days later in Singapore, General Seishiro Itagaki signed the instrument of surrender on board the British cruiser HMS Sussex in Keppel Harbour. On 12 September 1945, General Itagaki, accompanied by four other generals and two admirals26, signed 11 copies of the surrender documents at the Municipal Building (now known as the Former City Hall)27 to officially return Singapore to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the British Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia.28 12 September was celebrated as â€œVictory Dayâ€ for the rest of the colonial era in Singapore,29 closing the chapter on one of the darkest periods in Singapore's history.

I was commissioned by the National Heritage Board to create a photo essay of World War II (WWII) survivors to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore.
My pitch to them was to shine a light on the wrinkled faces of these amazing people through tight portraits on a red background. The red was meant to symbolise self-sacrifice and also serve as a metaphor for Singapore. I wanted pensive, stark and strong portraits to do the talking. My pre-conceived narrative had a more sombre tone, where the survivors reflected on their experiences during the war. It was not until I met the first subject for the photo shoot, did I realise that my direction was totally wrong.
When you find yourself in a situation way beyond your control, all you can do is to follow the instinct to survive. Perhaps after a horrible ordeal, do you then realise how precious life is, and you try to live the rest of your life in the most fruitful and meaningful way.
When we arrived for the photoshoot and video interview with Mr Joseph Conceicao, 92, a former Singapore ambassador and Member of Parliament, at his apartment in Marine Parade, he sternly asked one of the crew, ""Tell me young man, why is your hair golden?"" Everyone froze awkwardly for about two seconds before Mr Conceicao broke into a hearty laugh and said, â€œIt's okay young man. It looks good!â€ Age was evident, but the fire in his heart was still burning bright.
We were then invited into his apartment, which had a hearty collection of antiques and photographs collected from around the world, all displayed and labelled meticulously on his glass shelves. Without a doubt, he had travelled extensively throughout his life after the war.
""Call me Joe, young man,"" he said to me.
Mr Joseph Conceicao, 92, a former Singapore ambassador and Member of Parliament was about 17 in 1941 when the Japan bombings started in Singapore.
Mr Conceicao was a young man of around 17 years old in 1941 when the Japanese started bombing Singapore. His memory was still as sharp as ever as he recounted an incident with his cousin after the Japanese heavily bombed the Orchard and Newton areas to cut off communications:
""My cousin and I were curious and wanted to see the aftermath, so we walked across a field near our house towards a junction in the Newton Circus area. Suddenly I heard him gasping and I turned around to see what had happened. We saw hands, heads maybe, legs, and parts of the human body lying about. That affected him throughout the course of the war and his life.""
When Mr Conceicao's family eventually concluded that their home was too dangerous to continue living in due to the proximity of the bombings, they relocated to the basement of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC) building on Battery Road.
""While walking there with our belongings, we saw British soldiers who were taking off their military uniforms. Fleeing. To our shock, when we arrived at the Hong Kong Bank, there were more British soldiers sprawled across the place when they should be out there fighting. This gave us a terrible impression of them. Sir Shenton Thomas (then Governor of Singapore) said that Singapore must not fall, it shall not fall, but the next day it fell.""
Singapore fell on February 15, 1942.
Ms Mary Magdeline Pereira, 75, was born that year inside the Tiong Bahru air raid shelter â€“ tragically one day after her father was called for duty and perished.
""My father was activated for duty on January 21, 1942, and he told my mother, ""I don't know if I'll return."" True to his words, that was the day that Singapore had the worst casualty from the Japanese bombing. Many people died. I heard my father was carrying the injured when shrapnel hit him on his chest and on his face. That was how the war began for me - with the loss of my father just a day before I was born.
That very night, an air raid occurred and her family had to seek refuge inside the shelter located at Block 78, Guan Chuan Street. Inside, Ms Pereira's mother went into labour under the care of Professor J. S. English, Singapore's first professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, who was in charge of the medical unit in the shelter. With help from him and his wife, Mrs Pereira delivered her daughter just after midnight on January 22, 1942.
Ms Mary Magdeline Pereira, 75, was born the year Singapore fell, January 22, 1942, inside the Tiong Bahru air raid shelter. This was just one day after her father was called for duty and perished.
As I photographed her at the entrance of the very shelter she was born in, she told me, ""I think the war was a period where I grew up carefree and wild. I had so much independence and that is what gives me so much resilience to overcome all odds. I went through quite a tough time but I viewed it as an obstacle to overcome. When I could not get my teaching post in Singapore, I went to the United Kingdom to be a barrister at the age of 55. So don't tell me there isn't a time to learn.
""WWII has brought out one class of people, a generation that has resilience and has been able to overcome all odds. That was actually the good part of the war,"" added Ms Pereira.
It is a cold hard fact to confront but within the next two decades, there will be very few survivors of the Japanese Occupation around to tell the incredible personal stories that can seem straight out of a movie.
My first impression of Mrs Helen Joseph, 88, was that she is a very sweet lady who constantly has a smile on her face. Her demeanour reminded me of Betty White of the 1980s American sitcom, Golden Girls. Her home has a grand clock that rings a soothing chime every 15 minutes - a chime that sticks with me even till today. I thought, ""How could someone as nice as her go through something as terrible as the war?""
Mrs Helen Joseph, 88, was just 12 when the Japanese Occupation began. During this period, Helen stayed with her uncle and relatives in the Government Quarters along Rowell Road in Little India.
Mrs Joseph was just around 12 when the Japanese Occupation began.
""They took Chinese people by the lorries including my neighbour's husband,"" Mrs Joseph recalled. ""We then heard rumours that the Japanese had dug a hole in the Padang, laid out the Chinese men and shot them with machine guns. One by one, the men fell into the hole. One pretended that he was dead and waited till it was all quiet and then he ran away to tell everybody of the massacre. My neighbour never saw her husband again.""
It was known that the Japanese military committed numerous atrocities against civilians, especially the Chinese. During the Japanese Occupation, they introduced the system of ""Sook Ching"", which means ""purge through purification"" to get rid of civilians deemed to be anti-Japanese. The massacre is believed to have claimed the lives of around 20,000 ethnic Chinese in Singapore.
Mrs Joseph stayed with her uncle and relatives in Government Quarters along Rowell Road in Little India. Yet even during times of hardship, Mrs Joseph remembers the true communal spirit with many of her neighbours.
""It didn't matter if you were Chinese, Indian, Malay or Eurasian like me, everyone helped one another because we needed to. We had to queue up for food rations at 3am in the morning. Even so, when it came to our turn, the food would have run out and the person in charge would tell us to go away. Thankfully neighbours who had queued earlier would also share what they had with us.""
Feisty and seemingly fearless, Mrs Joseph also harboured secrets of the Japanese Occupation.
""The [prisoner of war] camps were near our place and we could see inside. The British soldiers were so skinny, all ribs. My sister and I would secretly pack some bread given by the Japanese into a bundle and leave them near the barbed wire fences and shout ""Johnny, Johnny!"" The next day the bundles would be gone.""
""Who is Johnny?"" I asked.
""We didn't know their names so we called them all Johnny!"" laughed Mrs Joseph.
I arrived earlier than the rest of the crew at Mr William Gwee's place in Lothian Terrace near Siglap and saw him reversing his car into the front porch of his house. Yes! At the age of 82, Mr Gwee is still actively driving, though he murmured to me that young drivers nowadays are reckless. The gate of the house has a beautiful flower structure that grows above it, making it look like a Tim Burton film set.
Students and researchers of Peranakan and Straits Chinese studies will no doubt be familiar with Mr Gwee, a fifth-generation Singapore Baba. Mr Gwee and his son, Andy, are prolific collectors and this was evident as soon as I stepped into the house. Mr Gwee probably has the largest collection of Baba Malay books in the world, and also collects memorabilia and artifacts pertaining to WWII, medicine and porcelain.
Mr William Gwee, 82, then eight years old, was about to start Primary 2 at his school when the war started.
Mr Gwee showed me into his study, which was indeed a treasure trove of the past, including hundreds of folders of newspaper cuttings, documents and letters, all purposefully organised by themes and topics.
When war reached Southeast Asia, Mr Gwee, then eight years old, was about to start Primary 2 at his school.
""I must say that the experiences I went through growing up during the three and a half years of the Japanese Occupation helped provide me with an accelerated maturity.""
The day Singapore became Syonan-To, the name given to the island by the Japanese during the Occupation, is still vivid to Mr Gwee.
""During the bombing days, before the surrender, my family took shelter at 97 Devonshire Road at my grand-aunt's house where we could see the Cathay Cinema. It was the tallest high-rise building in Singapore back then. Every day I saw the Union Jack of the British flag, fluttering high up on a pole on top of the building.""
""On that day, during the fall of Singapore, I was probably the first to realise that Singapore was about to change because when I looked out of the window at the building, I saw a different flag. It was a white flag with a red circle in the centre. So I shouted excitedly to the rest about the strange-looking flag above Cathay Cinema and my father came out and exclaimed, ""Sudah habis!"" The two words literally translate to,""We are finished.""
Three or four days after the surrender, the Japanese chased Mr Gwee and his family out of the house and they took shelter near his father's friend's home near the Sultan Mosque after much wandering around. ""When we walked on the streets we found out that thousands of people were also on the streets without a home. All of them were carrying bundles of food, clothing, bags and suitcases as if they were travelling. I was given small bundles to carry but after a long walk the bundles became quite heavy.""
After a long refuge at Mr Gwee's father's friend's house after the fall of Singapore, the streets were watched by Japanese soldiers.
""We wanted to return home but there was a Japanese sentry post on the road who arrested all the men that went past. Against the advice of his good friend, my father brought us to a table at the post and shouted some Japanese words and showed some pictures of him and his former bosses."" Mr Gwee's father had been under the employment of a Japanese company before the war started.
""This aroused the curiosity of the Japanese officers and soldiers, which I supposed save our lives because after that, the Japanese soldiers stamped something on each of our arms and shouted at us to move on.""
As Mr Gwee and his family walked home to Devonshire Road, he noticed that there were only women on the road, and he wondered why his father - a man - was allowed to roam the streets with his family unscathed. Many women they encountered along the way asked Mr Gwee's father what had happened to their loved ones. He could not answer. It was only after the war did everybody learn that most of the young men in Singapore were massacred and never came back.
Mr Gwee reminisced, ""75 years later, whenever I meet people who have been through the war, I ask them whether they had lost anybody during that period now known as 'Sook Ching'. I have not come across anybody who said no. Every one of them had lost somebody.""
""After Japan surrendered, the actual handing over of Singapore from the Japanese to the British took place in mid-September 1945. It was a big affair for the Singaporeans because of the sufferings they had to endure for three and a half years. It was time to see an end to their ordeal. So they came in the thousands and waited at the Padang opposite the City Hall building. When the Japanese came to surrender and marched up the steps of City Hall led by General Seishiro Itagaki, the people booed at the Japanese knowing that this time they could get away with it,"" added Mr Gwee.
""It was not until a few days later that Singaporeans had another interesting sight. They (the British) made the Japanese soldiers dig up the ground in front of City Hall to fill up other holes in front of the building. A huge crowd was watching the Japanese having to work for us for the first time. You saw nothing but smiling faces. Excitement. Sparkles in their eyes. Knowing that the worst was over.""
Perhaps everything does happen for a reason. These were ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances - caught in a dreadful war that led to the eventual independence of Singapore, a home to many of us now. Fate must have played a part, but let us not forget that our nation was also built upon a generation of people who endured a time we cannot imagine today. We therefore honour them by remembering their stories.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/roosters-of-the-national-collection/story,"Whether it's a pair of delicate traditional slippers or a vessel from the 15th Century, the National Collection has many special artefacts that feature this year's zodiac animal - the Rooster. Let's take a closer look at some of these pieces.
Red Junglefowl from the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings
Gift of Mr. G. K. Goh.
This plate shows a regal-looking pair of red junglefowl, which in its feral form has now become the most numerous bird in the world. The short, distinctive call of the wild rooster (the bird shown on the left of the drawing) can still be heard from the forest at dawn in some remote parts of Malaysia.
The Malay name, ayam hutan, means ""forest chicken"", and this species is, in fact, the ancestor of the domesticated chicken. You can still find the original form of the red junglefowl in forests in Malaysia and Pulau Ubin, Singapore, although frequent crossbreeding with domestic stock is weakening the wild species.
Embroidered Spectacle Case
This embroidered spectacle case from the Asian Civilisations Museum is made from velvet. The colourful floral motifs and that of a rooster are created from coloured silk thread using the raised satin stitch. This is a technique where flat stitches are used to cover an area of the fabric. Metallic thread couching is used to create a border of decorative patterns along the edges of this piece. These â€˜duan nipah' cases were flattened pouches with double layered cases. They consist of a slightly larger outer case which serves as the cover, made to slip snugly over the inner case or container.
A pair of Kasut Manek featuring Rooster Motifs
This pair of â€œKasut Manekâ€ or ""beaded shoes"" comes from the collection of The Peranakan Museum. The slipper face is covered with bead embroidery or threading. This is a technique where coloured seed beads are stitched onto a base fabric using needle and thread. More specifically, the technique of embroidery used is the petit point beadwork, in which the needle worker uses coloured beads to stitch out patterns drawn onto square paper. Such bead embroidery was usually done on velvet or plain weave cotton and required the use of a frame or â€˜pidangan'. The main motif on this piece is a rooster against an a green background with floral motifs. These slippers were traditionally worn with the â€œsarong kebayaâ€ (blouse and skirt cloth) or the â€œbaju panjangâ€ (long tunic).
Woodblock print, Chinese New Year (Rooster)
This woodblock print from the Asian Civilisations Museum belongs to a set of five made by woodblock water colour printing process. The motifs in these prints include baby boys, bird, phoenix and flowers. This one shows an image of a rooster. They are all popular themes that convey good wishes, and are generally decorated on the front doors of ordinary Chinese homes, to usher in the New Year in an auspicious way.
Chicken-shaped kendi
This kendi from the Asian Civilisations Museum originated from northern Vietnam between the 15th and 16th Centuries. A kendi is a special type of vessel that was found in many parts of Asia. They were often made in different shapes and forms.
Here, the chicken-shaped kendi was probably moulded in two parts before the vase was attached to the back of the bird separately, to provide as a mouthpiece. The details of the rooster, such as its tail plumes and facial features, were painted in blue before the piece was fired.
Every artefact in the National Collection has a story to tell, and these five offer just a small glimpse into the depth of artistry and history on display. Now, isn't that something to crow about?

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 2 - 2017
Encountering the sheer number of people at Tampines today can sometimes leave one overwhelmed. From its multiple shopping malls and offices to Our Tampines Hub, the estate's newest community and lifestyle destination, Tampines is often crowded with throngs of people going about their daily routines. According to a 2016 survey by the Department of Statistics, Singapore, Tampines was home to around 250,000 residents and was the third most populous residential town in Singapore after Bedok and Jurong West at the time. It is evident from the loads of passengers constantly spilling out from Tampines Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Station that Tampines is a town bustling with activity.
Yet, long-time residents who have lived in Tampines since the town was built in the 1980s recall a different picture of the area. Anwar Bin Haji Mawardee, who first moved into Tampines in 1985, remembers it as a desolate and empty new town: â€œAt that time there weren't as many flats [as there are today]. It wasn't as crowded as it is now... When we met our friends from other parts of the island, they would say, â€˜Wah you live in Tampines, you ulu type ah.'â€
Clarice Teoh, another resident who moved into the town in the early 1980s, echoes similar sentiments: â€œWhen we selected a at here, we were a bit hesitant. It was a bit like an â€˜end of the earth' feeling. Bedok was popular, and it was already built up, and most people didn't think beyond Bedok in the east.â€
Before the MRT line extended into Tampines, residents had to alight at Tanah Merah to take a feeder bus. There was also no proper bus interchange, save for a makeshift interchange along Tampines Avenue 5.
Tampines resident, Wendy Oh, recalls that the streets were barely lit at night: â€œWhen we moved here during the early 1980s, it was very remote and really dark at night. You wouldn't dare to go out at night as there were no street lights, and many of the HDB blocks were still under construction. I recalled asking myself then, why did I move to such an ulu area with no amenities?â€

These experiences of living in Tampines Town in its nascent years seem to mirror that of village life in the district before the 1980s. Ulu, which means â€œremoteâ€ in Malay, was a term often used to de ne Tampines even before the residential town was built. Due to the fact that until the 1970s, old Tampines Road was the only thoroughfare that traversed across north-eastern Singapore towards Changi, the district was relatively isolated from other parts of the island.

Tampines Road began in 1847 as a bridle path accommodating horses and pedestrians. The road spanned from the 6th milestone of Serangoon Road to Changi Road near the eastern tip of Singapore. Many early kampong (village) dwellers settled along this road, and some of the villages here included Kampong Teban, Teck Hock Village, Hun Yeang Village and Kampong Tampines.

Travelling into and out of the district was often a challenge for the villagers living in Tampines. Back then, bus services from town terminated at the 6th milestone of Serangoon Road (known as Kovan today), and commuters had to continue their journey into Tampines on pirate taxis and privately-owned buses.

Yvonne Siow, a former teacher at Tampines Primary School in the 1960s, recalls: â€œ[The drivers] would wait to get as many people into their taxis as possible and not all the pirate taxis would... travel deep into the kampong, as they would have trouble finding a customer on the way back. So some people resorted to hitching a ride from cars or lorries going in.â€
The area was so withdrawn that even in the late 1970s, when other parts of Singapore were being modernised, smaller streets located further down from Tampines Road remained unknown and difficult to locate. Jimmy Ong, who formerly lived in a Tampines kampong, shares: â€œWe could give visitors our address, but there was no way to tell them exactly where we stayed. What usually happened was that we would go out to the [nearby] school to wait for them and bring them in.â€
From the 1960s to the 1980s, Tampines was also associated with the sand quarrying and waste disposal industry, which not only damaged the surrounding environment, but also made living there an unpleasant experience. Sand from Tampines was used for the building of Housing & Development Board (HDB) towns in the 1960s, and demand for the material was so high that at its peak, there were 26 sand quarries operating in Tampines.

Quarrying left gaping holes in the ground, and runoff from the quarries often resulted in floods and choked drains. In addition, the nearby Lorong Halus landfill, sometimes referred to as the â€œTampines dumping groundâ€, emitted foul stenches that could reach as far as MacPherson on the occasions when its garbage mounds â€“ as tall as 10 storeys â€“ caught fire.

Nevertheless, despite these inconveniences, former kampong dwellers also fondly reminisce about the close-knit relationships fostered with their neighbours and friends, as well as the community-centric spirit that was part of daily life.
Florence Neo, who grew up near Hun Yeang Village, elaborates: â€œTo me, kampong spirit means that whenever there is a need, everybody chips in to help. When my mum gave birth to me and my siblings, her neighbours came over and taught her what to cook and advised her what to eat.â€
Villagers also bonded over simple entertainment such as catching insects or watching wayang (â€œstreet operaâ€ in Malay) shows that were organised by the Chinese temples in the vicinity. Albert Peh, who lived in Kampong Teban, remembers the large crowds of villagers who would gather at the Tua Pek Kong temple during a wayang show. He shares: â€œFor us kids, we were most excited by the pushcarts that came with food, sweets and flavoured ice balls. There were also tikam tikam (â€œgames of chanceâ€ in Malay) stalls, some with roulette wheels, [where] you could win toys or money.â€

These images described by former kampong villagers and early residents of Tampines Town are a stark contrast to the modern and bustling residential town we see today. It was highly unlikely that anyone living here in the 1980s could imagine that Tampines would receive the World Habitat Award from the Building and Social Housing Foundation and UN-Habitat just a decade later in 1991, even beating out contending entries from Vancouver, Canada and Boston, USA. Overnight, Tampines Town became recognised as an exemplar of â€œhigh-quality, high-density and affordable housingâ€, and was touted as a model that cities around the world could replicate.

The award was a historic moment for Singapore as the achievements of the country's public housing were finally being recognised on an international level. By the time HDB started designing Tampines Town in the 1970s, Singapore's post-war housing shortage had been largely resolved, allowing the Board to channel its resources into improving its town planning models.
The award was an affirmation of the many town planning innovations that the HDB pioneered in Tampines, which sought to foster community bonds and encourage neighbourly interaction. The innovations included the introduction of integrated green corridors â€“ a precursor to today's ubiquitous park connectors, as well as the precinct concept, which brought amenities closer to residents and encouraged greater social interaction between residents from different socio-economic backgrounds.
The HDB also sought to capture the unique identity and heritage of Tampines in its architecture. HDB architect Lee-Loy Kwee Wah wanted to reflect the fruit farms of rural Tampines in her designs of the town's public playgrounds. After briefly experimenting with different fruit designs (including a durian playground that was later deemed too risky due to the fruit's spikes), she produced three playgrounds that were installed in Tampines: the watermelon, mangosteen and pineapple playgrounds. The former two playgrounds can still be found in Tampines Central Park, and have become iconic symbols of Tampines.

Other town planning innovations included blocks of varied designs and heights, open spaces for communal activities, and a well-integrated transport network system consisting of the MRT and Pan- Island Expressway.
In 1991, the town entered yet another phase of its development when it was designated Singapore's first Regional Centre, a concept spearheaded by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to grow commercial centres in suburban areas. Major corporations soon established themselves in Tampines, including the former Pavilion Cineplex and DBS Tampines Centre, which housed Japanese retailer Sogo.

The concept also paved the way for the construction of large shopping malls in Tampines, starting with Century Square in 1995 and Tampines Mall the following year.

For the generation that grew up in Tampines in the 1990s, these malls were the setting for many outings with friends and families.
Former Tampines resident Bryne Leong shares: â€œ[I remember going to] Pavilion and watching Disney movies and Titanic. There was a Burger King downstairs where a schoolmate and I would share a meal and fight over French fries.â€
Although Pavilion and Tampines Centre have since been demolished, Tampines Mall, Century Square and the town's latest shopping mall, Tampines One, have taken over as popular hangouts for Tampines residents.
As the town gradually matured, stories of ulu kampongs and a dark, desolate town also began to fade into history. Nevertheless, aspects of Tampines' heritage can still be found at some sites today, especially in its religious institutions.
For example, hidden inside the grand Tampines Chinese Temple at Tampines Street 21 is a temple plaque that dates to 1851. The plaque belongs to the Soon Hin Ancient Temple, a Taoist village temple that was first set up in an attap hut at Jalan Ang Siang Kong at the 11th milestone of Tampines Road. Similarly, Masjid Darul Ghufran at Tampines Avenue 5, had its origins in the multiple surau (â€œprayer housesâ€ in Malay) which served Muslim villagers in the east. These surau raised funds for the building of the mosque, which was completed in 1990.

Finally, while almost all of Tampines' former quarries have been filled in, two quarry pits still remain â€“ one has been converted into Bedok Reservoir, while another lies abandoned and hidden behind a row of trees along Tampines Avenue 10.
TAMPINES HERITAGE TRAIL
Many of the heritage sites in Tampines can be explored through the Tampines Heritage Trail that was launched in September 2017. It chronicles the history of Tampines from the 19th century to the present day, piecing a layered narrative of the town through archival records, social memories, photographs and maps.
Trail goers can embark on any of the three specially curated thematic short trails that explore different aspects of Tampines' heritage. The Tampines Town Trail explores some of the town planning innovations and sites of everyday heritage in the town; the Religious Institutions Trail explores the diverse houses of faith found in the area and highlights its unique architecture and practices; and the Green Spaces Trail is NHB's first cycling trail, taking cyclists to heritage and scenic locales in Tampines, including former kampong locations, and a former landfill turned wetland.
The launch of Tampines Heritage Trail follows the August 2017 opening of Our Tampines Gallery, a gallery that showcases the heritage of Tampines with a focus on community-contributed stories and collections. Our Tampines Gallery is located within the Tampines Regional Library at Our Tampines Hub, the first integrated community and lifestyle hub in Singapore. Presented by NHB, the gallery is developed together with the community, and aims to make heritage more accessible and inclusive for everyone. Its inaugural exhibition is titled Tampines: A History, and presents an overview of the history of Tampines through maps, photographs and objects.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/kopi-talk-with-our-clans-and-associations/story,"Ever wondered what clans and associations in Singapore do? Well, we sure did, and here are some insights into our afternoon chats over kopi with these champions of Chinese heritage and culture.
Residing in the colourful shophouses along Chinatown, many are aware of the existence of clans and associations, but our understanding of them is often less clear.
A common one would be that they have ties to secret societies, according to Jack Tan, the 56-year-old Vice Secretary of the Chin Woo Athletic Association. However, he clarifies, the association conducts a careful screening of their members for links with secret society gangs as well as criminal activity, so that's one myth debunked.
Another is the belief that members of clans and associations comprise the elderly, and all they do is gather to chat and drink tea. Well, you may actually see members chatting over tea, but it is certainly not all they do.
While their day-to-day operations may not be the most glamorous, these clans and associations are culturally significant. Each representing a different cultural aspect of the Chinese community in Singapore, they play an integral role in preserving an important piece of our history.
Preserving Nanyin
Founded in 1941, Siong Leng Musical Association aims to promote and preserve traditional Nanyin music and Liyuan opera in Singapore. But what exactly is Nanyin music? Loosely translated, it means ""music from the South"", where the province of Fujian is in China.
Project Manager of Siong Leng, Seow Ming Xian, 23, explains, ""Nanyin music originates from Fujian. The masters write books, articles, research papers and songs about Nanyin, but there are no documents in English that we can show to the English speaking community.""
Seow Ming Xian, Project Manager of Siong Leng (left), with fellow members.
Hence, to bring its art to the uninitiated, Siong Leng performs annually at various places such as Thian Hock Keng and Kusu Island. The association also stages major productions locally and participates in music festivals overseas, gaining international recognition for its art forms.
Besides its yearly heritage performances and artistic productions, perhaps Siong Leng's most important work resides in the translating and digitally archiving of Nanyin documents from the masters in the Fujian province of China. These documents mostly exist as physical copies, and the association is working on a cloud archival system to make these resources more accessible and available to everyone.
Are You a Li?
A traditional surname clan, Kwong Wai Siew Li Si She Shut takes in only members of the Li clan and family, as opposed to cultural clans and associations where membership is open to anyone.
While Kwong Wai Siew Li Si She Shut was initially set up 140 years ago to help the Li immigrants from China find jobs, housing, and to provide them with a place of shelter, that role has obviously ceased over time.
Lee Wai Ching (bottom right) with other clan members
The clan now serves as a generational legacy that seeks to preserve the spirit of community within the Li clan and family. During Chinese festivals such as the Lunar New Year, Mid-Autumn festival and Dragon Boat festival, the clan will organise a huge celebration and invite members and their families to participate. Through these cultural festivals, the clan members try to teach the younger generations the meanings behind the festivals, to nurture their appreciation of Chinese heritage.
Values through Sports
Serving as a sports school in the olden days, where there were no public gyms or sports facilities, Chin Woo Athletic Association offered members training for a variety of sports when it was founded in 1921.
Over the years, the association has built up a reputation for its impressive lion dance and martial arts performances, and its members often perform at various festivals and events. In addition to performing, Chin Woo also teaches its motto to members as a way of passing down its culture and heritage. Translated to English, it reads, â€œLove one's country, cultivate one's character, righteousness, and helping others.â€
Jack Tan, the 56-year-old Vice Secretary of Chin Woo Athletic Association, adds, â€œWe teach them the Chin Woo motto so that they understand how to be loyal to our country, and be self-disciplined and kind to people. These are all part of Chinese values.â€

What most may not know, though, is that Chin Woo's history has strong ties with Singapore's history, and one that the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew played a part in. According to the General Secretary of Chin Woo, Kwong Yuen Hung, Mr Lee used to watch their practice sessions as a boy at their training grounds, now known as Duxton Plain Park.
Kwong, 80, reveals that the values of Chin Woo resonated so strongly with Mr Lee that in 1965, he made a speech to the members of the association about enlisting in the army.
The Challenges Ahead
Though their cultural and historical significance is acknowledged, all three organisations admit that they face difficulties in keeping up with the times, especially when it comes to recruiting younger members.
While it is challenging, efforts have been made to reach out to the younger folk, and capture their interest. Siong Leng fuses its traditional Nanyin music with current genres like jazz; Kwong Wai Siew is planning to create an online presence; while Chin Woo tailors its performances to make them fun and enjoyable for the young, and organises overseas trips and performances. In the face of progress and modernisation, the associations will continue to work hard to capture the hearts and commitment of the next generation.

THE FIVE-DOLLAR TREE
  A majestic icon stands, tucked away within the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG). At 30 metres tall, its commanding presence dominates its surrounding landscape. It is a tree - a tembusu - believed to be at least 150 years old as of 2016 and which probably existed before the Gardens was set up in 1859. Perhaps, its most striking feature is a curled and low-lying branch, which makes it stand out from the other trees in the Gardens. This tree holds great significance in the nation's heritage: Affectionately known as the ""Five-Dollar Tree"", it is the iconic tree found on the Singapore five-dollar note, drawn by local artist Eng Siak Loy.
TEMBUSU TREES
The tembusu, also known as the Fagraea fragrans, is commonly found in Southeast Asia. The trees are plentiful in Singapore, with many old ones still present at the Tanglin area where flora has survived the course of Singapore's development. The tembusu bark often has deep fissures; it flowers twice a year in May and October with white and yellow blooms, and is often pollinated by nocturnal moths that feed on its round berries. Its wood is durable, tough and frequently used to make chopping boards. The tree has been likened metaphorically to a ""lover's hard heart"" by Singaporean poets.
While conical in shape when young, tembusu tees tend to become very tall and irregularly-shaped upon maturity. These older trees usually grow a few horizontal and short branches, which in turn bear many tall and vertical branchlets. The tembusu is regarded as a slow-growing tree that is robust and resistant to many pests and diseases.
HISTORY OF THE ""FIVE-DOLLAR TREE""
The widely-recognized tembusu is featured on Singapore's current five-dollar notes as of 2016. While the actual age and origins of the tree are unknown, it had probably grown naturally on the leftover wasteland of gambier planting days before the SBG was set up. Its earliest documentation was in the 1880s, by a British named Walter Fox. At that time, Fox was the Assistant Superintendent of the SBG, a position he held from 1879 to 1903. Fox had recorded the existence of the tembusu tree in his horticultural guide of the gardens that was published in 1889, and also produced in the guide the earliest known photograph of the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" to date, taken in the 1880s. Given that the tree was already mature when Fox wrote his horticultural guide, it is evident as of 2016 that the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" is now well beyond 150 years old!
ONE OF A KIND
Unmistakably, the most defining feature of this venerable tembusu tree is the thick, low-lying and twirled horizontal branch that stems from its main trunk. It is unclear exactly why this tree sports a unique branch, but common consensus agrees that when lower tembusu branches are left unpruned, they sag towards the ground and then ""turn up"" as they continue growing. Moreover, since this tree existed before the Gardens was set up, it likely grew amidst lower canopies and secondary rainforest growth that existed then, resulting in the low-growing branch. It is this iconic branch that gave Singaporean artist Eng Siak Loy his inspiration for the five-dollar bill design.
ON THE FIVE-DOLLAR NOTE
Besides the five-dollar note, Eng has also designed for the other currency denominations. His drawings were selected after he won a design competition organized by the Monetary Association of Singapore, from which winning designs were selected for the 1999 Singapore Currency Portrait Series. Eng has a distinct impression of the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" since his youth, especially when he worked for the National Parks Board as a graphic designer at the SBG.
""The theme for the five-dollar note was 'Garden City', so I wanted to select a tree native to Singapore. I settled on this particular tembusu because it is a distinct landmark that locals and tourists recognize at the Botanic Gardens,"" said Eng. ""The main thing I want to capture was the unique branch. There are many tembusu trees around, but none of them look like this one, and you can easily identify this tree just by looking at the branch!"" Eng has also incorporated the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" into his designs for a ""Heritage Trees Stamp"" series, which went on to win many international awards.
CONSERVING THE FIVE-DOLLAR TREE'S HERITAGE
Since the tree is extremely old, measures have been taken to conserve its structural integrity. After many decades of growing without support, the SBG installed a wooden prop beneath the low-lying branch in 1992. Then, in 2003, this prop was replaced with two others for additional support. Without these props, the iconic branch would possibly have broken off under its own weight and compromised the structural integrity of the entire tree. Still, a long-term solution was required because those props were static, unable to adapt to organic changes of a tree and restrictive to a tree's growth patterns.
Eventually, a team of engineers from Singapore Technologies Kinetic developed a dynamic support system in 2014. It had a suspension mechanism to brace the branch a three points without obstructing its growth. A decision was also made to fence the tree up to prevent visitors from stepping on its roots and perching on the horizontal branch. According to the National Parks Board, high visitation had caused soil compaction that had hindered root growth. It was hoped that over time, the leaf litter around the trunk will decompose and enrich the soil together with soil organisms, thereby allowing the tembusu's roots to thrive once again.
Having a photo taken while posing on the iconic horizontal branch used to be a popular trend, but it seems unlikely that visitors today will get a chance to do so again.
OTHER TEMBUSU TREES IN SINGAPORE
The ""Five-Dollar Tree"" is not the only tembusu Heritage Tree in Singapore - twelve others across the country also have the Heritage Tree status - with a couple on St. John's Island and Sentosa Island.
That said, perhaps no other tembusu tree besides the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" will ever achieve similar historical status. With a combination of factors - the unique low-lying branch, the majesty of its physical stature, its presence throughout Singapore's modern history, and its significance on the five-dollar bill - the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" will definitely continue to be a celebrated part of Singapore's heritage at the SBG.
Singapore Botanic Gardens was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 4 July 2015. As of 2016, the Gardens is the first and only tropical botanic garden on the UNESCO's World Heritage List. The Tembusu Tree is one of the Heritage Trees in the Gardens.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 3 - Jan 2017
A pair of beautiful vases was recently acquired by the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and now sits on display in its Trade Gallery. The vases connect many different cultures over the centuries, having travelled the world, from China where it was made in the 18th century, to France, Britain, the United States and today, Singapore. Interestingly, the vases share a connection with the hit British TV drama series, Downton Abbey.
A pair of mounted blue jars. Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum.
The plot of Downton Abbey in which an American heiress provides much-needed cash to a struggling British aristocratic estate was based on the story of a real-life American heiress named Consuelo Vanderbilt, who lived from 1877 to 1964. She was a famed beauty and socialite, and the daughter of William K. Vanderbilt, one of the richest Americans of the late-19th century, who at one point owned this pair of vases.

Consuelo's wealth and charm attracted the attention of many European suitors. In 1895, she met the Duke of Marlborough at a prominent social event. The duke, who was to later receive a US$2.5 million dowry, owned Blenheim Palace - one of the grandest country houses in England.
The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough inspired one of the most grandiose yet insipid portraits of the time. It was painted by John S. Sargent and still hangs at Blenheim Palace today. The puffy drapery and shallow expressions captured in the panting seemed to reflect their loveless marriage, which ended in 1906.

In 1921, Consuelo re-married Jacques Balsan, a dashing French pilot and heir to a textile fortune. In 1937, a book on their French home in the countryside north of Paris was published. In one of the pictures, you can see sitting on a sumptuous mid-18th century mantle, the ACM's blue vases.
The vases feature a deep glaze, characteristic of porcelains produced in China during the reign of Emperor Qianlong from 1736 to 1745. They were likely to have been exported to Europe soon after they were made because the mounts consisting of dragons cast in bronze and then gilded were added in Parish shortly after. This combination of Chinese and European art was clearly adored by Consuelo Vanderbilt, who represented the taste of aristocracy during the modernist age of gossipy and opulent excess.

Community champion Thamizhavel Govindasamy Sarangapany (20 April 1903-16 March 1974) played an important role in the formation of the Tamil Murasu newspaper. The Tamil Murasu was established in 1935 to educate Tamil immigrants and foster a sense of rootedness to their new land.
Community champion Thamizhavel Govindasamy Sarangapany (20 April 1903-16 March 1974) played an important role in the formation of the Tamil Murasu newspaper. The Tamil Murasu was established in 1935  to educate Tamil immigrants and foster a sense of rootedness to their new land.1
Tamil Murasu was founded by The Management Committee headed by A C Suppiah at the Tamil Reform Association.2 Sarangapany was heavily involved when Tamil Murasu had been set up, playing the role as its editor. The paper aimed to propagate TRA's reformist causes and as such the Tamil Murasu produced its first issue on 6th July 1935 outlining its intention to initiate social reforms.
The paper's ownership was later transferred to Sarangapany around 1936.3 Sarangapany had bought the paper despite the financial difficulties involved in running it, as he was keen in enforcing social reforms amongst the Tamil community in Singapore.4 He also advocated for Tamil to feature as one of Singapore's four official languages.
Settling in Singapore
Thamizhavel Govindasamy Sarangapany moved to Singapore at 21 from Thiruvarur in Tamil Nadu, India.5 He was well-educated and thus able to secure a respectable job as an accountant at an import-export firm in Market Street.
His arrival in 1924 coincided with a large wave of Indian migration to Malaya. In 1911, the Indian population in Singapore stood at about 28,500. By 1931, this number had grown to about 50,900 Indians.
The late Thamizhavel Govindasamy Sarangapany was often spotted in his trademark outfit of a white dhoti (a long wrap worn around the hips and thighs), a white juppa (a loose, long-sleeved shirt), and leather sandals. Â©National Heritage Board
Community advocate
Sarangapany, driven by a progressive mindset and a fervent desire to improve the circumstances of the impoverished and illiterate Tamil population in Malaya, spearheaded several initiatives. In 1930, he set up the Tamil Reform Association to uproot dated beliefs, overhaul attitudes towards the caste system, and put an end to vices and social problems such as addiction to toddy, a cheap alcoholic substance.6

He practised what he preached. Breaking away from social norms with regards to caste, he married a Chinese Peranakan woman- Madam Lim Boon Neo, in 1937.  He also officiated Hindu weddings for couples from different castes.7

In 1935, he was heavily involved in the efforts carried out by TRA to start a newspaper called Tamil Murasu to educate and unify the diverse Indian community.8  (The newspaper's name translates to Tamil drum, in reference to an old practice where drums used to be sounded for community announcements.) He sold it for a cent.9 In the 1950s, the Tamil Murasu served as a platform to encourage immigrants to acquire Singapore citizenship.10 

To encourage the development of Tamil literary arts, Sarangapany rolled out a weekly student supplement in the paper to motivate youth to write and submit poems, essays, and short stories. Manavar Murasu, which still runs today, helped nurture and cultivate a pool of successful writers such as the award-winning poet Kavignareru Amallathasan.

Separately, Sarangapany also set up the Tamil Education Society to improve the curriculum and recruitment of well-trained teachers for Tamil schools in Singapore Tamil schools.11

As part of efforts to raise the profile of the Tamil language, Sarangapany lobbied tirelessly for its inclusion as an official language in Singapore. His wish was fulfilled after Singapore gained independence.

Sarangapany's contributions towards shaping and building a united Singapore have not gone unnoticed. In 1996, the association of Singapore Tamil writers started the Thamizhavel award for Tamil writers in his honour.12 Later in 2004, the G. Sarangapany education trust fund was established to help students.13 The G. Sarangapany education trust fund continues to contribute via endowments and donations to organisations such as the Singapore Indian Education Trust.14

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/naraina-pillai/story,"TL;DR
Naraina Pillai was the first Tamil to set foot in Singapore, arriving in style in 1819 in the same vessel as Stamford Raffles who was on his second visit to the island.1 Formerly a government clerk in Penang,2 Pillai found himself having to restart his career in Singapore. He was quick to find his footing and did well enough to construct Singapore's oldest Hindu temple, the Sri Mariamman Temple,3 in 1827.
Naraina Pillai was one of the first Indians to set foot in Singapore. He came onboard The Indiana4 along with Stamford Raffles.
Giving Singapore a try
While working as a government clerk for the British in Penang,5 Naraina Pillai was enticed by Stamford Raffles' effusive praise for the strategically located and freshly established colony of Singapore.6 Deciding to seek out new prospects, Pillai packed his bags and accompanied Raffles on his second visit to Singapore via The Indiana. They arrived in May 1819. The move earned him the title of the first recorded Indian immigrant to step foot in Singapore.
Brick by brick
However, upon arrival, Pillai learnt that he had to rebuild his career from scratch. His first job, a temporary role to help weed out counterfeit money in the colonial treasury, did not amount to much.
Instead of being disheartened, Pillai sought to restart his career. Seeing that the burgeoning city of Singapore lacked housing infrastructure, he decided to set up a brickworks. Pillai wrote to his contacts abroad, seeking bricklayers, carpenters and artisans from Penang and South India to join him.7 His foresight earned him yet another entry in the record books which credit him for starting Singapore's first brick company. Pillai's kiln was located at Mount Erskine (Tanjong Pagar today).8
Pillai found even more commercial success in the form of a textile shop which he established at Cross Street. Owing to an arrangement he had with British merchants who allowed him to retain bundles of cloth and cotton products on credit, his shop became famous for its wide variety. This venture, however, was disrupted when a fire destroyed his shop. Not taking the setback lying down, Pillai approached Raffles â€” the reason he was in Singapore in the first place â€” for help. Raffles obliged, providing him with a piece of prime land at Commercial Square (Raffles Place today) which Pillai put to good use.9
An outstanding community leader
Now a rather prominent member of society, Pillai was often approached by other Indian settlers for help and counsel. Just three years after his arrival, the British made Pillai leader of the Indian community.10
Pillai made it his mission to build Singapore's first Hindu shrine, writing to the authorities for a plot of land.11 His wish was granted in 1823 after he was allocated a suitable site at South Bridge Road. The shrine was completed in 1827.
Over the decades, the temple underwent various refurbishments. Two updates in particular were significant. The first involved Indian convicts and craftsmen from Madras (Chennai today) who helped build a brick version of the temple in 1843. Subsequently, in the early 1860s, skilled artisans from the Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts of Tamil Nadu in South India were hired to build a more permanent structure â€” the basis for the very building which stands in Chinatown today.12

  Remembering Pillai
The Sri Mariamman Temple has been an integral part of the community from the get-go. In its early years, it was the only site in the city where priests could solemnise Hindu marriages.13 Today, it continues to serve as sacred grounds for a variety of everyday rituals and festivities. To commemorate the temple's storied past, cultural contributions and founder's legacy, it was gazetted as a national monument in 1973.
The Sri Mariamman Temple which was gazetted as a national monument in 1973, serves hundreds of devotees and tourists daily.
Pillai's legacy was also recognised in 1957 when the authorities named a road in Serangoon after him.14
More recently in 2019, a statue honouring his contributions to Singapore was installed along the Singapore River as part of the nation's bicentennial celebrations.15
Pillai's story is also commemorated at the Indian Heritage Centre.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-snake-in-the-banyan-tree/story,"Have you heard the beating of the kompang? The flat round drum is often used in Malay weddings and makes a very interesting thumping sound. Even more interesting is the story of how the drum came about.
Long ago, in the northwest of Singapore, there stood at the very entrance of a village an enormous banyan tree. The villagers wanted to cut the tree down not only because it blocked their way, but also because every night a haunting melody would float out of the foliage and send everyone into a deep slumber.
When the villagers awoke in the morning, they would always find the bones of their missing chickens and goats at the foot of the banyan tree.
The people were baffled. â€œWe don't know what's living inside that tree,â€ said Hussein, scratching his head in dismay. â€œWe have to destroy that tree! It is cursed,â€ exclaimed Ishyak nervously. His home was located closest to the tree and he was always the first to fall asleep.
â€œI have lost all of my chickens. I can't afford to lose any more goats!â€ lamented Daud, looking down at his five hungry children. The village chief decided it was time to do something about that tree. Grabbing his spear, he ordered the men to surround the tree with flaming torches.
When they threw their torches at the tree, the same chilling music resonated from within. It cast a spell on those nearby, causing them to fall asleep immediately. Ali, who was deaf and unaffected by the magical music, was shocked to see a gigantic snake with red patchy skin slithering out of the crackling, charred branches.
â€œWake up, wake up!â€ he cried to his friends as the snake hissed angrily at him. Then an idea struck him. From a nearby well, he quickly drew a bucket of cold water and splashed it on the men to rouse them.
â€œWhâ€¦what happened?â€ muttered Hussein. But before anyone could answer, the snake sprang at them. All the men struck the reptile's body repeatedly with their weapons but its chunky trunk-like body was as hard as a rock. Terrified and exhausted, the men dropped their weapons and fled home.
A vision came to the villagers as they lay in bed that night. They dreamt that the snake could only be destroyed by special fire stones, which would burn when water was added to them. However, they had to wait till the next month when the wicked serpent would drift into a deep sleep.
Days slipped by. Then weeks. At the appointed time, the villagers eagerly gathered again at the banyan tree. Soon, they began hurling fire stones at the tree and flinging water at them. The tree shook violently as it burst into flames and a part of the snake rolled out.
A slew of arrows hit the snake in the head but it continued to mesmerise the men with its music. â€œStuff your ears with cloth!â€ suggested Ishyak.
Unable to put his attackers to sleep, the snake was powerless. After countless blows, it squirmed and quivered and collapsed to the ground like a dead log.
The villagers punished the snake by skinning it. They stretched its skin on a bowl and began beating it. As each person struck the skin, it made a surprisingly interesting sound. Played out together, the music was rather delightful.
And thus the kompang was born. So whenever you see or hear a kompang, you will recall the trouble it brought as well as the beauty it created.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/haji-hashim-haji-abdullah/story,"Bridging the gap between education and knowledge and the Malay/Muslim community, Haji Hashim Bin Haji Abdullah was more than a bookstore owner â€“ he wrote a chapter of the history of Singapore Malays with the longevity of his humble bookstore.
Haji Hashim Haji Abdullah at his desk. Image Credit: Pioneers of Early Singapore
BACKGROUND
Born in 1900 in Singapore, Hj Hashim Bin Abdullah (1900 â€“ 1968) came from a Semarang family of merchants who were involved with the trading of the literary field â€“ poets, authors, writers, publishers, and scribes.
Eventually, the newer generation would pick up the pen, and this was the beginning of the first bookstore by his father, Haji Abdullah Bin Muhammad Said.
His uncle, Muhammad Bin Muhammad Said, was the author of several well-known Malay fables that have transcended through time. He was also the Head Principal of a local madrasah in Bussorah Street, which served as a platform for him to disseminate his writings.
His other uncle, Mujtahid Bin Muhammad Said, was the publisher of those said books.
Being in a family of authors and publishers naturally motivated Haji Hashim to open his own bookstore; he eventually fulfilled that dream.
CAREER AND ACHIEVEMENTS
At 20, Haji Hashim married Esamah Binte Abdul Rahim. In 1922, with the money gifted by his father, the couple opened a bookstore at 134 Arab Street.
He was mainly selling books written and published from both of his uncles, his father, and some of his other relatives who were in the same industry.
However, the bookstore initially ran into financial troubles. Business slowed down during World War II, and books were seen as a novelty in those curfew-laden evenings.
Adding on to those problems was the Arab owner who insisted on selling his share of the shop space to Haji Hashim because of the unrests. In order to buy over that space, Haji Hashim's wife pawned off her gold. His eldest three children helped to sell traditional food such as nasi lemak, samosas, and nasi jenganan along the streets of Kampong Glam for months.
Even when Haji Hashim's home got bombed on during World War II, business went on at the bookstore. Despite everything, Haji Hashim was determined to keep the bookstore running, as it was his main source of income to feed his growing family of nine children.
Unsuspectingly, what propelled the business forward was the arrival of the Malayan army that was preparing to join forces with Singapore against the oncoming Japanese troops. While some visited the store to buy books or simply browsed, they all left with a homemade Hari Raya greeting card in hand. At that time, the bookstore profited from the sales of those homemade cards.
After the Japanese Occupation, business began to flourish. This was due to the government's increased emphasis on education and literature. New schools were opened, but students did not have textbooks. They used only pieces of papers or information to study. Haji Hashim compiled these into complete books to be used by his children. Soon, he started supplying proper school textbooks to Malay schools and madrasahs. The store later also became a well-known book distributor in Singapore and around the region â€”particularly in Malaya and Indonesia.
LEGACY
Haji Hashim passed away in 1968, leaving behind his whole family to continue writing the chapters of his bookstore.
Almost a century since it opened, Haji Hashim Bookstore has managed to stand the test of time, withstanding a recent trend of many bookstores that have had to shutter for good due to changing reading habits.
Haji Hashim Bookstore, which is now located at Joo Chiat Complex, is sustained by his grandchildren under Haji Hashim Enterprise. Despite its newly refurbished interior, this bookstore has been through turbulent chapters, mirroring Singapore's own past, to become what it is today.
Today, it is one of the first local Malay bookstores that is still running, having managed to survive the war and unrests of pre-independence. Its legacy as a haven of knowledge for the Malay and Muslim community lives on.

Self-made millionaire Lim Kim San (30 November 1916 â€“ 20 July 2006) was handpicked to serve as the Housing and Development Board's (HDB) first chairman. He was tasked to help make good on the People's Action Party's promise of providing public housing for the masses. Working quickly and without pay, he rolled out a series of measures to overhaul building practices, leading the HDB to complete more than 31,000 flats in the span of four years â€“ far more than its predecessor, the Singapore Improvement Trust built in three decades.

The township of Toa Payoh was developed by the Housing Development Board in the latter half of the 1960s as part of its efforts to address Singapore's housing shortage.1 (c.1960s. Image from the National Collection)
Millionaire by 34
The oldest of six children, the Singapore-born Lim studied at Anglo-Chinese School and graduated from Raffles College with a diploma in economics. From a young age he was exposed to his family's business which dealt with rubber, salt, sago and gasoline.
After the war, the business-savvy Lim worked at a sago plant where he devised a cost-effective method to produce sago pearls, an ingredient commonly used in Asian cuisine. This innovation helped him make his first million.
In the 1950s, Lim served as director of two banks.2
No nonsense approach to public housing
In 1959, Lim was approached by Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee â€” â€” members of the People's Action Party (PAP) â€” to serve in the Public Service Commission. Later, Goh, the finance minister, asked Lim to chair the newly-formed Housing Development Board (HDB) which was established to rehome hundreds of thousands living in squalor. Lim, who took up the role, did not draw a salary for four years.
Plunging himself into the role, Lim implemented sweeping changes to standardise the building and construction sector. Dedicated to his mission of providing affordable housing to the masses, he cut red tape, ended dodgy and corrupt practices, and assembled a team of powerhouses to work alongside him.3
Known for being hands-on, he visited worksites often and at times picked up on major construction errors. For instance, he noticed that a block of flats at Margaret Drive in Queenstown was crooked and its contractor was made to rebuild it.
The resultant speed in which high quality flats rose across the island is said to have contributed to the PAP's landslide victory in the 1963 elections. For solving Singapore's public housing dilemma, Lim was awarded the Order of Temasek, the state's most prestigious honour.4 He was the first such person to receive it.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Sri-Warisan-Shaping-a-Singapore-Malay-dance-identity/Sri-Warisan-Shaping-a-Singapore-Malay-dance-identity,"Established in 1997, Sri Warisan Som Said Performing Arts is Singapore's first professional Malay dance company. Since the 1950s, its founder and pioneer dancer/choreographer Madam Som Said has been building on centuries of tradition while also innovating through cross-cultural collaborations.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Sri Warisan

  The Malay dance scene in Singapore had long absorbed influences, forms and techniques from regional royal courts, grassroots and popular movements, as well as styles from further afield including Indian, Portuguese and Arabic dances. In the 1960s, Indonesian choreographers helped fashion the course of modern Malay dance through their collaborations with multidisciplinary arts group Sriwana, and Nanyang University.
Madam Som, an alumnus of Sriwana before establishing Sri Warisan Som Said Performing Arts in 1997, was already accomplished in the regional dance styles. However, she was determined to create a dance identity that would reflect the lifestyles, values and heritage of Malays in Singapore. Hence, Madam Som drew from both the foundations of regional dance forms and the interactions of a multicultural society.
â€œMy initial works were based on Malay customs, guided by the Islamic teachings and rich cultural values, with the use of symbolic props and gestures to portray Malay aesthetic valuesâ€, the Cultural Medallion winner added. After a training stint at the Padepokan Seni Bagong academy, under Indonesian dance master Bagong Kusudiarjo, she added contemporary techniques that further evolved Malay dance here.
Today, the productions of Sri Warisan continue to be inspired by the heritage and traditions of Southeast Asia, such as the heroic Tun Fatimah of Malacca, and Radin Mas, the Javanese princess that gave her name to the area in Telok Blangah.
Innovating and safeguarding heritage
Sri Warisan's productions in the 21st century have included Onak Samudera - The Untold Dance Journey (2014), Bendahara - A Betrayal (2012) and Towkay Wayang - A Musical (2009). The group has also grown into a multidisciplinary collective, helping sustain the performing traditions of dance, bangsawan (opera), angklung (a Javanese music form) and wayang kulit (shadow puppet plays).
â€œWe preserve (performing traditions) through teaching, conducting classes and workshops, and we promote them by performing, and we create (new works). When we create, we embrace the roots, but we create with platforms where we allow the youths to hold on to their traditions (while interpreting them) in their own way. This allows us to move forward (while) safeguarding our heritageâ€, says Madam Som.

Her son Adel Ahmad, Sri Warisan's managing director and second generation practitioner, adds: â€œWe want to make sure that (through) Malay dance, bangsawan, wayang kulit, dikir barat, angklung, (we can) reach out to everybodyâ€¦(and that audiences) will be touched by and relate to these performing arts.â€
The changing tastes and perspectives of audiences have also led to necessary reinvention. Acknowledging that some may view traditional art forms like wayang kulit as staid and irrelevant to the current milieu, Adel and the Sri Warisan artists have introduced modern elements including digital graphics and animation to their productions.
Reaching out to the next generation
After taking over the management of the company in 2000, Adel set the goal of having Sri Warisan tour 100 cities over the next two decades. That intent was fulfilled four years ahead of schedule, in 2016. Of Sri Warisan's international scope, he says: â€œOur dancers learn something at every festival and use that knowledge to train others.â€ He also focused on developing more dance teachers and trainers, ensuring that the company could expand its programmes to more schools and institutions.
Each year, Sri Warisan performs at more than 200 local and international events and festivals, while also conducting more than 3,000 courses and workshops. Their dance courses, tailored for different levels, encompass traditional Malay forms while also taking in dances from the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Thailand. The company also offers other lessons in other performing arts including wayang kulit, and their music workshops span forms such as angklung, kompang, dikir barat and Asian drumming techniques.
Since 1993, the group has also worked closely with schools and other performing companies through the National Arts Council Arts Education programme. Melding dance with cultural education, Sri Warisan's programmes in this area deepen the understanding of various aspects of our heritage, including cultural festivals, kampung life, Southeast Asian legends and epics, as well as place histories.
Continuing in the vital currents of collaboration and cultural intersections that characterised Singapore's post-independence dance scene, Sri Warisan has collaborated with other groups including Bhaskar Arts Academy, the Chinese Opera Institute, Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society (SIFAS) and the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. In 2002, Sri Warisan's dancers collaborated with SIFAS, Hua Yan Buddhist Society and the Chinese Opera Institute in The Fifth Lotus and travelled to India to perform the Ramayana with Apsaras Arts in 2009.
Madam Som says: â€œI hope that the future generation, while busy with promoting their own ethnic dance and moving towards contemporary [dance], will still find time to continue this legacy to work together as one across races.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/zubir-said/story,"TL;DR
Singapore's National Anthem would have sounded completely different had its composer Zubir Said (22 July 1907-16 November 1987) adhered to family traditions. From a conservative Sumatran household which believed music was haram, Zubir picked up music secretly and made his own instruments. He eventually left for Singapore and embarked on a prolific career, composing more than 1,500 songs for film, radio and the national stage. His repertoire includes the masterpiece, Majulah Singapura. His timeless and evocative melodies continue to attract a new generation of fans online, with some proclaiming that his music â€œneeds to be on Spotifyâ€.
Watch: The Golden Era - Zubir Said
  Marching to the beat of his own drum
His father considered music haram but that did not stop Zubir Said from pursuing his interest in music.1
In primary school, the Sumatra-born Zubir carved his own flute out of bamboo and participated in a band with other young flautists.2 In middle school, he picked up the guitar and drums.3
With pressing financial needs, a career in music was a pipe dream for Zubir. He thus took on work as a brickmaker and copy typist until an encounter with a Dutch district officer inspired him to pursue his passion. To this end, he became the leader of a roving keroncong (an Indonesian style of music) band which moved from village to village in Sumatra. They played at functions such as weddings and fun fairs.
His father, however, was very eager to have him take over as village chief, or enter into a career in the Dutch army or administration. At 21, Zubir had enough. He left for Singapore in a cargo vessel.4 The metropolis was his port of choice, having been sold on the idea by a sailor friend who told him about the colony's glittering lights, and the availability of kopi susu (coffee with milk) and butter.
Malay film and music pioneer
Zubir's started his music career in Singapore with a bangsawan (a form of Malay operatic theatre) troupe, performing with them at the Happy Valley amusement park in Tanjong Pagar. There, he picked up new skills and instruments such as the piano while gradually rising through the ranks and eventually becoming the troupe's leader.
In 1936, he was recruited by the British-owned record label His Master's Voice, or HMV, as a recording supervisor. By this time, Zubir was fairly well-known. The war, however, did a number on his career and he returned to his hometown with his two wives and children. In 1947, after the war, Zubir returned to Singapore where he found work as a part-time photographer at Malay language newspaper Utusan Melayu.
His big break coincided with the golden age of the Malay film industry. In 1949, he began work at Shaw Brothers' Malay Film Production division. There, he composed songs for Malay films5 and box office hits such as Chinta (Love), a romantic drama about a village girl and a shipwrecked stranger who turns out to be a king.
However, Zubir felt unfulfilled in this role so he left the company for Cathay-Keris' Malay film arm where he was given the opportunity to set the tone for entire movies by creating custom background mood music and orchestral arrangements.6 This was a major shift from the industry's reliance on European tracks and was thus a role he cherished.7 Zubir also wrote songs for musical greats such as P. Ramlee, R. Ismail and Nona Asiah; and produced Malay classics such as Sayang Di Sayang, Pulang Merantau and Cempaka Biru.
Zubir was involved in a number of acclaimed films such as Jula Juli Bintang Tiga and Dang Anom which picked up awards at the Asian Film Festival in 1959 and 1962. Critics noted his ability to move audiences to tears with his soothing, melancholic pieces. Zubir eventually retired from Cathay-Keris in 1964.

The genesis of Majulah Singapura
Zubir's undisputable talent and his one-of-a-kind sound which helped define an era, caught the attention of Singapore's City Council in 1958. It invited him to write an official song based on the motto Majulah Singapura (onward Singapore in Malay).10
Zubir's composition was performed for the first time on 6 September 1958 at a concert to mark Victoria Theatre's reopening,11 and at other mass events such as a Youth Rally at the Padang the following February. His contributions towards Singapore's nationalistic efforts was well-received, moving audiences with its powerful expression of the progressive spirit of Singapore and the aspirations of its people.
A version of Majulah Singapura was subsequently introduced to the public as the national anthem on 3 December 1959, the same year Singapore attained self-government.12 It was a momentous occasion where the first Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara (head of state in Malay), Yusof bin Ishak, had also been inaugurated. Zubir's father, now 101 in age, travelled from Indonesia to witness the occasion following decades of estrangement.
Zubir was said to have been incredibly honoured by the opportunity to contribute to the nationalist efforts of the period. He understood the power that music had in rousing patriotic feelings13 and fostering a sense of connection between people during an era marked by instability and change.

Musical legacy
Over the course of his life, Zubir wrote 1,500 songs, a number of which were dedicated to the community. Orang Singapura, for instance, was about being a kind and graceful person of Singapore.14 He also wrote a song for birthday celebrations which he called Selamat. Semoga Bahagia is yet another stirring composition of his. In it, he reminds the youth of Singapore to pursue their dreams and happiness, as he had.15
Recognising his contributions to the nation, the government of Singapore embarked on an effort to track down Zubir's scores and lyrics in the 1980s.16 Later, in the 2000s, as part of an effort to further Zubir's legacy, his family signed an agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group which manages his repertoire, to allow his work to be available for download, and to be recorded by other artistes.
His daughter, Rohana Zubir, also worked on a project to document her father's life and prolific career. Her book, Zubir Said: The Composer of Majulah Singapura, was published in 2012.
In 2009, a road was named after him in Dhoby Ghaut.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Michael-Ker-Making-heritage-food-that-stands-the-test-of-time/story,"Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Popiah has been based in Joo Chiat for more than eight decades, having been started by third-generation owner Michael Ker's grandfather as a pushcart hawker business. His grandfather, an immigrant from Anxi in China's Fujian province, married a Peranakan woman from Malacca and turned out popiah in the Nyonya style, with its characteristic filing including stewed turnips (bangkwang), prawns and chilli.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Michael Ker

Heritage food establishments like Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Popiah that have stood the test of time are often asked about their secret recipes. Given that these venerable formulas bestowed through the generations are often the key to drawing and retaining a loyal clientele, heirloom recipes and methods are not shared on a whim.
Ker, however, will tell you his family's recipe without skipping a beat. â€œThe secret recipe is experience â€“ when your hand touches the dough, you will instinctively know whether you need to add more water, salt or oilâ€, he says.
Perfecting the craft of hand-made popiah skins
Popiah skins have been hand-made at Kway Guan Huat since 1938, and it is this dedication to traditional methods that have taken the shop through decades of changing tastes and pressures for more efficient production via automation.
Kway Guan Huat's emphasis on the hand-made process renders the popiah skins more chewy, springy and translucent than machine-made ones, and hand-made skins are favoured by customers despite lasting only a day due to their lack of preservative agents.
The experience that Ker speaks of is an integral element in producing hand-made popiah skins. At Kway Guan Huat, this process involves the dough recipe, a pair of cast-iron hotplates forged in the Jalan Sultan area more than 50 years ago, and the techniques of hand-working the dough. Only by putting in the thousands of hours into mixing, twisting and swirling the dough can one gain the necessary experience to work the deceptively simple mixture of flour, water, salt, and oil â€“ one which Ker has kept alive as a third-generation practitioner and owner.
The dough is then left to ferment for a couple of hours, before being beaten with a wooden paddle. Once air bubbles form, the dough is ready for cooking. Flipping a 400g handful of dough onto the hotplates, Ker is heedless of the 150-degree Celsius heat from the plates.
The technique of flipping the dough onto the hotplates was learnt through countless episodes of getting burnt as he studied at the hands of his father and uncles since the age of 13. During festive occasions, when demand for popiah skins is high, everyone at Kway Guan Huat would make skins for more than 12 hours straight.
Keeping traditional food heritage alive
Ker says of the popiah-making process: â€œI wake up early in the morning and I do the popiah skins, making hundreds to thousands of pieces every day. This is like practising yoga or tai chi every day; if I don't do it, I feel a bit uneasy.â€ It is mastery of a food culture born of dedicated practice; Ker took several years to truly become an expert in handling the skins.
This commitment to a life of craft was not what Ker's father intended for him. â€œWhen I was a young boy, my father never wanted me to take over the family business. He was always pushing me to study hard, get a job outside in an air-conditioned roomâ€, he says. Instead, Ker kept polishing his techniques, eventually left a career as a pharmacist, and took over the business in 2013.
â€œI decided to carry on our family tradition of making popiah because it goes back three generations. It would been a pity if I didn't do it and the heritage of this food vanished. From an air-conditioned office, I moved to a hot, sweaty environment with long hours. It's tiring, it's hard work, but it's something I feel is preciousâ€, he adds.
Even as Kway Guan Huat is known for its traditional methods and traditional tastes, Ker has innovated to sustain the business, including introducing pandan-flavoured popiah skins and roast duck fillings. Recalling the communal and family-centric nature of popiah meals in years past, the shop offers packages for convenient group dining, and has also established an online presence.
Keeping popiah culture alive is another focus for Ker. He has been conducting education workshops and demonstrations for tourists, local groups, and students, which delve into the cultural history of popiah and are paired with tastings. The shop will also be installing a heritage gallery, where Ker can â€œexplain the origins of this heritage food, the culture, the techniques and the craft of making [popiah]â€, he says.

In this vein, Ker collaborated with the Singapore Tourism Board and other corporations to showcase the popiah craft at food festivals worldwide, including in New York, Copenhagen and Dubai.
Ker continues to transmit the popiah craft by passing on time-honoured techniques to younger members of the family. â€œI hope I can spur the younger generations to take the unconventional pathâ€, he says, adding: â€œBut it must come from them, you can't force it. It's not an easy thing to do.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Nam-Hwa-Opera-Tradition-professionalism-and-cultural-transmission/story,"For millennia, the performing arts have been a medium for people to express, examine and redefine their culture and heritage. Since Nam Hwa Opera's earliest days as a group of amateurs brought together by a love of Teochew opera, this spirit of cultural exploration and critical inquiry has been evident.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Nam Hwa
  Ahead of their debut public performance in 1963, the amateur opera enthusiasts had few resources to lean on. Inventively, the performers sought out screenings of the 1962 Teochew opera movie Chen San and Wu Niang, diligently studying the expressions and interactions of characters, including the eponymous lovelorn couple.
Today, after decades of advancing its operatic craft and building itself as an institution, Nam Hwa has established itself as one of Singapore's premier performing arts companies, with a prolific opera troupe, a Teochew music ensemble, a talent development programme and a cultural research centre under its umbrella.
From its amateur roots to its current roles, what lay behind this consistent attention to detail, this drive to master the fundamentals of chang (singing), nian (reciting) and zuo (acting)? What motivated the performers over the years to absorb the unspoken but myriad range of emotions expressed by the movements of the shui xiu (water sleeves) and other aesthetic elements?
The elements of Teochew opera, from plots to characterisations and performance language, from lyrics and dialogue to set design, speak volumes of the values of generations past. These values include filial piety, loyalty, justice, and the responsibilities and bonds individuals have and maintain within society.
â€œRoots are important for building up a person's character by inculcating values, and if you want to keep these values, then the preservation of art forms is keyâ€, says Nam Hwa's president Toh Lim Mok.
Mastering the art of Singaporean Teochew opera
Dedication to the craft and cultural transmission of Teochew opera has been a vital strand in Nam Hwa's DNA over the past half-century. For decades, the company moved to professionalise its craft and operations by regularly engaging with directors, performers and trainers from foreign troupes. The expertise of and exchange with foreign practitioners, as well as Nam Hwa's travels to perform in China, South Korea and Cambodia among other countries, means that the company has absorbed and reflected a wide range of operatic styles.
Along with other local groups, Nam Hwa was also part of the evolution of a Singaporean style of Teochew opera, which has made it different from its Chao Shan origins. While sustaining traditional Chinese values and customs, the practice of Teochew opera here has also organically assimilated influences from the island's multicultural society.
Determined to engage audiences of different generations and cultural perspectives, Nam Hwa has set traditional stories in modern environments, such as Jin Hua Sending Her Husband Off, a classic tale given a twist with contemporary outfits and familiar accessories such as passports and handbags.
Stories with local narratives, themes and settings, including Match-making at the Five-foot Way and Voyage to Nanyang, have also delighted audiences. Other innovations such as collaborations with Chinese orchestras and experiments with zhe zi xi (excerpt operas) are all closely tied to the company's philosophy of keeping Teochew opera and culture alive by remaining connected and relevant to the community.
From the opera stage to the Teochew world
Nam Hwa's well-regarded talent development programme, helmed by opera professionals, also provides different performing pathways and platforms for student performers. Young talents are introduced to the art form through engagements with schools, nurtured through acting, singing and music classes, and given opportunities to shine on the Nam Hwa Blazes platform, a series of free public performances.
One such talent, 17-year-old Tan Wei Tian, says: â€œI love Teochew opera because it's a very magical, and fascinating art form. There are many messages and stories to tell from the performancesâ€¦and I think that our future generations should be able to get to know Teochew opera to have a deeper understanding of their roots and embrace their traditions.â€

Tan's passion for the art form has taken her in front of audiences in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia and China, including at a TEDxSingapore event, and led to her being named as an ambassador for a Singapore Tourism Board campaign.
Nam Hwa's programmes and workshops extend to the community and amateur circles. Nam Hwa also offers introductory classes for children and adults in acting, dance and vocal fundamentals, stage makeup, the Teochew language, musical performance. To encourage intergenerational learning and exchange, drama courses designed for parents and children to participate in together are also offered.
Beyond training performers and musicians, and giving them platforms to showcase their virtuosity, the company has also established the Yeo Khee Lim Teochew Culture Research Centre. The centre explores the manifold aspects of Teochew opera and the broader cultural heritage it draws upon through a collection of publications, Teochew opera songs digitised from vinyl records, and works produced by Teochew artists.
Established to promote deeper and wider understanding of the Teochew culture among the public, the centre also collaborates with academia and supports further research and documentation through publishing, academic forums, exhibitions and research scholarships.

Into the 21st century, Thow Kwang Pottery Jungle stands as one of two remaining dragon kilns on the island, and the only one still in operation.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Thow Kwang
  A tradition and technology brought to Singapore by Chinese migrants, dragon kilns initially produced mass use pottery such as cups, jars and vats, as well as the latex collectors used in rubber plantations.
Established in the 1940s before being bought by Tan Kim Seh in the 1960s, the Tan family has maintained the continuity of the wood-fired tradition through numerous economic and cultural shifts over the decades. Today, Thow Kwang has shifted from mass to artisanal production, and the Pottery Jungle also hosts workshops, classes, heritage tours and an artists' group.
While the nature of production has changed, the expertise and knowledge required to work the dragon kiln has been sustained by the Tan family. Tried and tested by earlier generations, the techniques that have been passed down include the judicious arrangement of some 3,000 ceramic pieces inside the kiln, and the kindling of the flame within the firebox, or â€˜head' of the dragon kiln. With the kiln temperature gradually brought to more than 1,200 degrees Celsius, the firing temperature in each chamber is continually monitored and stoked.
â€œFiring a dragon kiln is (about) teamwork, and (the people of) Thow Kwang Clay Artists have been with us for many years and are experienced in the firing processâ€, says Yulianti Tan, who is married to Tan Teck Yoke, the son of Thow Kwang's founder Tan Kim Seh. â€œWe share (knowledge and expertise) with the potters, interest groups, and also open up to the public to let them have first-hand experience of the dragon kiln firing.â€ On the two to three occasions a year the dragon kiln is fired, artisanal potters and volunteers work in shifts across two to three days, keeping its flame and the traditions of wood-fired pottery alive. Thow Kwang allows potters to fire their own works in the dragon kiln, asking only that they work together to tend the flame.
Artistry and tradition in wood-fired pottery
Resource-heavy and labour-intensive, dragon kilns demand watchful supervision and sustained stoking over several days to produce their ceramic bounty, in contrast to gas and electric kilns, which are easier to handle. However, the unique beauty of wood-fired pottery is tangible. Pieces that emerge from the engulfing flames of dragon kilns bear the glassy, variable imprimatur of ash glazes, possible only with wood-fired pottery and the interaction of fire, clay and fly ash. When you hold a wood-fired ceramic cup or shard in your hand, you hold a thread of tradition that connects generations and across diverse communities.
Growing up in a pottery factory, Teck Yoke and his siblings were exposed to the artistry and tradition of wood-fired pottery since young. As pottery wares were in high demand up to the 1980s, Teck Yoke often spent much of his time at the factory to help out with the production, even when he was a student. Inspired by the hard work of his parents and their dedication to keep the pottery factory going, he continued the family legacy of the dragon kiln as a second-generation practitioner.
For Teck Yoke, the continued operation of the dragon kiln today â€œrecords the generations this art has been passed on to, even as Singapore, a young country, has developedâ€. â€œI think this experience of the dragon kiln and its firing (would help) our younger generation to learn from our forefathers' resilience, fortitude and characterâ€, his wife Yulianti adds.
Keeping the flame alive
Thow Kwang's shift from commercial production has also seen it nurture pottery groups through a range of activities, establish a social media presence, and run programmes for youth, as well as experiment with pottery as rehabilitation therapy for the elderly.
Engaging existing and potential new pottery connoisseurs through social media, as well as running an online store, comes under the purview of Stella Tan, Thow Kwang's studio director and a third-generation practitioner within the family. She has also ventured into new avenues of business by participating in craft markets, providing customised ceramics for cafes, restaurants and hotels as well as keeping Thow Kwang attuned to contemporary preferences in pottery styles.
Thow Kwang also continues to run ceramics workshops, started by Stella's aunt Yulianti in 2000, as well as the Thow Kwang Clay Artists group, which provides a platform for potters to practise their skills and sustain their passion.

â€œWe conduct interesting workshops like hand-building (clay) and (working) pottery wheels. These workshops bring (people) closer to the dragon kiln and show them the beauty of the pottery fired in the dragon kilnâ€, says Stella. Beyond the fundamentals of pottery techniques, design and glazing, Thow Kwang's workshops also spread knowledge of the history and heritage of dragon kilns in Singapore as well as their firing traditions.â€
She added
â€œ It's important to carry on the legacy passed down to me from my grandfather, and to share the knowledge and skills of the dragon kiln and wood-fired pottery to (future) generationsâ€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/baharuddin-ariff/story,"Although his name is potentially lost in the pages of Singapore's history, there is no denying that Baharuddin Mohd Ariff was an integral piece to our nation's story.
Early Years
Baharuddin bin Mohd Ariff (1933 â€“ 1961) was born in Kuala Lumpur. After completing his education at Kuala Lumpur's Victoria Institute, he began his career as a journalist.
In 1951, he joined Utusan Melayu, the first Malay-language landmark publication at that time to be wholly owned by Malays. At that time, he saw the challenges that the British reoccupation brought to war-torn Singapore, a nation still unsure of its next step. There were no real solidified laws during that era; instead, there were constant strikes by unsatisfied workers and discontent students.
As a journalist, he often challenged the status quo. He covered the labour worker demonstrations and wrote many articles that were focused on their union movements. From there, he built his credibility as a news gatherer through his thorough investigations, and eventually, his influence on his readers.
On his own time, he also served in several mosque communities and took an active interest in political and trade union work. He was Hon. Secretary of the Singapore Printing Employees' Union from 1956 to 1957.
Career & Achievements
His incisive articles on the various issues that plagued the nation during those difficult pre-independence years caught the attention of the local political parties. The fact that he was a reporter too, made a stronger case for him to be involved in politics.
Baharuddin saw this as an opportunity to change the dire situations that he had previously just been an observer to. Thus began his political career.
In December 1957, he successfully contested the City Council elections as the People's Action Party (PAP) candidate for Crawford. Two years later, in 1959, he was elected Assemblyman for Anson, which precipitated a self-government for Singapore.
In between these couple of years, he also served as a committee member of the National Union of Journalists (1957-1959).
Knowing the public gave him an edge â€“ he was aware of the real struggles of his countrymen. Within the PAP, Baharuddin was a star on the rise. Among his plans was to restructure and nationalise the education system. Sadly, time was not on his side. He succumbed to a sudden illness at the young age of 28.
The assemblyman in the PAP unfortunately never saw the country he loved and fought for, in her most pivotal moment. He died in April 1961, four years before Singapore gained her independence.
Legacy
Still, his name lived on through the younger generations who had been schooled at the Former Baharuddin Vocational Institute, along Queensway.
It was Singapore's first vocational tertiary school that was dedicated to manual and applied arts. Officially opened by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, on 20 June 1965, the vocational institute nurtured skilled local designers and craftsmen in advertising, fashion, and printing trades.
Baharuddin believed in the need for â€˜softer skills' besides the country's focus on technical workmanship, sciences, engineering and the ilk, the latter being instrumental to the turning point of Singapore's economy. Courses conducted at Baharuddin Vocational Institute included commercial art, dressmaking, furniture design, pottery, and shell crafts.
The school marked a radical change in Singapore's education policy. It readied students for skilled jobs in the industrialised city-state. There was also a shift in emphasis of simply gaining basic knowledge. The school invited the workforce to think about upgrading their existing skills.
The Institute relocated to a new site at Stirling Road in 1969.
For the next two decades, Baharuddin Vocational Institute was the main institute that nurtured graphic designers, apprentices, and craftsmen in Singapore.
In 1990, the entire applied arts department from Baharuddin Vocational Institute moved to Temasek Polytechnic to start the School of Design. This led to the closure of the Institute.
Although the name nor the institute is no longer around, the nationalistic values that Baharuddin Mohd Ariff had instilled in the youth will always live on in the dreams of a better Singapore.
To see where the Baharuddin Vocational Institute used to be, and discover other heritage sites within the area, embark on the Queenstown Heritage Trail.

In today's fast-paced Singapore, it is hard to imagine ancient art forms like Nanyin (å—éŸ³) and Liyuan (æ¢¨ åœ’) opera taking root and finding a following among youths. Yet a Singaporean group in their 20s faithfully immerse themselves in this world of centuries-old musical instruments such as the dongxiao and sanxian, and slow, melodious singing in Southern Min dialect.
â€œNanyin is soothing and calming... and not something youngsters in Singapore would chance upon easily,â€ highlighted Joel Chia, one of the seven principal musicians in the Siong Leng Musical Association.
Siong Leng Musical Association innovates with contemporary stage and musical arrangements of Nanyin, featuring traditional instruments with cross-cultural elements. Soul Journey â€“ Cicada Zen (è‰ã€‚æ¯) performed at Esplanade Theatre Studio, July 2012.
The original tone of instruments, tunes, lyrics and vocalisation are carefully preserved through scores and scripts, via a teacher- apprentice system. Watching a Nanyin performance today is similar to watching it in ancient China. Nanyin is often nicknamed the living fossil of ancient Chinese music and was listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2009.

Nanyin and Liyuan Opera
Nanyin (â€œsouthern musicâ€ in Chinese) is a music genre which originated as court music during the Han Dynasty in China, more than two thousand years ago. As civil unrest over the years uprooted nobles and musicians from the Central Plains, Nanyin took root in the southern coastal area of Quanzhou in Fujian province.
In recent centuries, Nanyin followed the Chinese diaspora and spread to other shores. It reached Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, where large groups of people of southern Chinese origin reside.
Nanyin remains close to its most traditional form, with music, lyrics and instrumental performance methods originating from Song and Tang Dynasty periods. Traditionally, Nanyin is performed by five musicians, with the vocalist seated in the middle and holding a clapper to set the beat. On the left, two musicians would play the dongxiao, a bamboo flute, and the erxian, a two-stringed fiddle. On the right of the vocalist, two other musicians would play the pipa, a Chinese lute, and the sanxian, whose sound is one octave lower than the pipa.
An ancient instrument that survived the times is the sibao, a percussion instrument consisting four pieces of bamboo that is unique to Nanyin,
Illustration from Music of the South, 2004.
What makes Nanyin unique is its close preservation of the art form. The dongxiao has retained its length of one foot eight inches in Nanyin, and while the modern-day pipa is constructed with a straight neck and held upright, Nanyin musicians use a crooked-necked pipa and hold it horizontally, like a guitar.
A natural extension of Nanyin music, Liyuan opera's origins can be traced to Quanzhou in Fujian, China. Unlike Teochew, Hokkien or Cantonese operas, Liyuan opera is a lesser-known variety of Chinese opera. It is commonly regarded as dramatised Nanyin. Preserving elements and essence of Tang and Song dynasties' Nan opera, Liyuan opera is one of the most ancient surviving forms of Chinese opera.
Keeping Traditional Art Alive
Siong Leng Musical Association was founded in 1941. Today its mission is to preserve, develop and promote Nanyin and Liyuan Opera. What sets it apart from other traditional performing troupes is that most of the members in the Nanyin section are relatively young, in their 20s, providing an interesting contrast to this ancient art form.
The charm of the old, traditional music is precisely what draws its members together. However, being traditional is a double-edged sword for Nanyin and Liyuan Opera. While its quiet, old-world charm attracts some, others find it hard to endear themselves to these niche art forms.
Lin Shao Ling, Artistic Director of the association in 2016, recognises this challenge. Bold, new directions have been taken to bring Nanyin closer to the local audience. He has experimented with the use of musical instruments such as the Indian tabla and Malay kompang to create fusion performances. During the 2016 Huayi Festival at the Singapore Esplanade, he blended Nanyin and Xinyao songs.

â€œWe want to create a multi-sensorial experience for our audience where they are enveloped in a whole artistic and cultural experience,â€ Lin shared. â€œThat is why before our performances at the Esplanade, our audiences participate in a ritual of cleansing their hands with flowered water, listening to music and sipping tea amidst the scent of incense. These allow audience members to quieten their hearts and minds and be more ready to experience the soothing Zen-like ambience of Nanyin.â€

To reach a bigger audience and stay in touch with older Nanyin appreciators, Siong Leng keeps up an annual tradition of staging three open performances at the Thian Hock Keng Temple and a performance at Kusu Island. The team has also conducted workshops and demonstrations at public libraries, and continues to hold special workshops at its Bukit Pasoh premises.
The passion to keep the art form alive keeps Lin and his team going. This is a spirit they inherited from the late Teng Mah Seng, a Cultural Medallion recipient and former chairman of Siong Leng, who was a prolific Nanyin artist himself, composing more than a hundred Nanyin songs.
In 1983, Teng brought Siong Leng's artists to compete overseas, walking away with a third prize in the Folk Solo category at the 37th Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. It was the first time Nanyin had shone on the world stage. The feat was repeated in 2010 when Siong Leng took part in the same contest and clinched first prize.
Celestina Wang, Executive Director of Siong Leng, was a protÃ©gÃ© of the late Teng. She was tasked to run the association after his passing, and still looks to Teng's legacy of foresight for guidance. â€œMr Teng's undying spirit in promoting Nanyin and Liyuan Opera continues to spur us to greater heights,â€ Wang said.
Cultivating the Next Generation of Artists
For Wang, her key challenge is to keep this cultural endeavour going. ""In five to ten years, we need a new generation of musicians and instructors to take the association further,"" she said.
The current hand-picked team of seven young local musicians, including Wang's two sons, were selected to join the association during their teenage years. Since 1999, they have been journeying to China for intensive training with Nanyin masters. Back at Siong Leng, they are also taking up roles in administration and marketing even as they prepare for performances throughout the year.
Siong Leng's seven - a new generation of young principal musicians being groomed to lead the association, 2013.
Over the years, the seven have grown to become a close-knit group. â€œAn intimate bond and a level of chemistry have built up between the seven of us after playing Nanyin together for so many years and training together,â€ said Cassandra Wang, principal musician and teacher of pipa and sanxian at Siong Leng.
Looking Ahead
Lin strives to produce quality contemporary Nanyin presentations that Singaporeans will come to know and appreciate. He shared: â€œIt is also my hope that Siong Leng can take Nanyin and Liyuan opera into the international scene. Even more pressing is the transmission of culture, which must happen together with the passing of the art to the next generation.â€
It is this dedication to heritage and culture that makes Siong Leng Musical Association a treasured organisation in Singapore.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/themeparks-in-singapore/story,"Before the advent of television and the glittering thoroughfares of Orchard, many looked to other avenues of amusement to entertain themselves. From the 1920s to the early 1990s, Singapore's nightlife was filled with the sights and sounds of revellers enjoying themselves at its amusement parks. An era of variety shows, risquÃ© cabaret dances, Hokkien and Malay troupe performances, rickety rides, and wrestling matches, these parks captivated both adults and children alike. Today's glitzy amusement parks court relatively tamer acts, but the amusement parks of yesteryear defined and set the tone for them.
New World Amusement Park

Singapore's earliest amusement park was set up by Straits Chinese brothers and businessmen, Ong Boon Tat and Ong Peng Hock in 1923. Riding on the coattails of the previously successful Malaya-Borneo exhibition that had attracted 300,000 visitors with its Ferris wheel and carousel, international trade fair, cinemas, football matches and cultural performances, the brothers established New World amusement park along the area bounded by Jalan Besar , Kitchener Road, Serangoon Road and Petain Road.
Within a decade, the park acquired a reputation for its boxing contests, opera performances and cabaret shows . In the 1930s, the park was completely bought over by the Shaw Brothers who had an initial stake in the park. The end of the war revived the park when it introduced striptease as part of its attractions.

By the 1960s, however, New World could no longer compete with the arrival of shopping malls and television, and slowly faded from Singapore's entertainment scene. It finally closed in 1987 when the Shaw Organisation sold the land for commercial development. Today, City Square mall, a condominium and a park sit on the amusement park's old grounds. Only New World's original entrance gate remains standing today.
Great World Amusement Park

The second â€œworldâ€ to open was Great World amusement park in 1931 â€“ its owner, Lim Choon Yung â€“ a relative of philanthropist Lee Kong Chian. Sitting on the crossroads of Kim Seng, River Valley and Zion Road , the park boasted live shows, travelling circuses, Shanghainese and Cantonese operas, Malay Bangsawan theatre , boxing matches, as well as a zoo and a coloured water fountain.
Despite its patronage of society's upper classes and British servicemen, business soon became lacklustre, impelling Lee Choon Yung to sell his land and park to the Shaw Brothers in 1941. Soon after, World War II descended on the region and the Japanese Occupation saw the transformation of the park into a prison for Australian POWs, and later, a gambling den.

The end of the Occupation allowed Great World to return to its former glory in a bigger way: with carnival rides like carousels and Ferris wheels, the installing of fountains, and revue shows. During its heyday, the park was said to enjoy attendances of up to 50,000 a night . Also facing rival entertainment, Great World saw declining visitors till its closure in 1964. The Shaw Foundation sold the park to a property developer who eventually constructed the present Great World City Shopping Centre.
Gay World Amusement Park (Happy World)
Initially christened Happy World in 1936, but later renamed in 1964, Gay World was the third and last of the â€œWorldâ€ parks troika to open in 1937. Owned by George Lee Geok Eng â€“ a businessman â€“ it occupied a 10 acre plot of land at the junction of Geylang Road and Mountbatten Road. Similar to the two other parks, Gay World also had the conventional food stalls, open air cinemas, game booths, and performances that catered to families with children. 
View of Happy World amusement park located between Geylang Road and Mountbatten Road | c.1940s | Lim Kheng Chye Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore
But what set the park apart was the sheer immensity of its premises to accommodate a covered stadium of 7000-capacity that could play host to boxing matches and sports competitions ; an oval-shaped cabaret hall; theatres for Chinese, Malay and Tamil shows; and an open-air cinema that could seat 300. New World's trajectory, however, also headed in the same direction as its other two counterparts: after its post war recovery as a gambling den, patrons continued to throng the park until new entertainment options cropped up, stealing away customers.
Within a span of nearly three decades, Gay World was also ravaged by fire nearly seven times, maiming several of its main attractions. In 2000, the premises' tenants were given notice to vacate. The Gay World indoor stadium, renamed Geylang Indoor Stadium and managed by the Singapore Sports Council, continued to operate at the site until its 2001 demolition  alongside the park.
Wonderland Amusement Park
As the popularity of the â€˜three worlds' waned, Wonderland Amusement Park blossomed. Opening in 1969 at Kallang, it was built on reclaimed land that shared boundaries with the old Kallang Airport. Along with being an entertainment venue for children and adults, the park also played host to plenty of festival and corporate events such as â€˜Family Day'. 
Wonderland was known for its popular cup-and-saucer carousel that let carnival-goers sit in giant spinning cups for a dizzy ride. Emblazoned with Ovaltine advertisements about cocoa-flavoured beverage , the cups allowed thrill-seekers to spin faster by twisting a wheel in the centre of the cup.
With its colourful umbrellas , kiddie train rides and rollercoasters, Wonderland was a place for children of the 70s to spend many of their halcyon childhood days. By 1988 however, due to a frequent unavailability of amusement rides, the park ceased its operations. The land the park sat on was developed into the present day open air car park serving Kallang Indoor Stadium.
Big Splash Theme Park

Big Splash, the legendary waterpark at East Coast Park, was well known for its towering rainbow coloured slides. Opened in 1977, it featured an 85-metre long water slide that claimed to be the highest and longest in the world at that time. The largest pool was reported to be able to accommodate 1,380 people and all the other pools in the complex were filled with sea water and had sandy bottoms to simulate the impression of a beach. Other than its slide attraction, Big Splash also featured other facilities like an open-air theatre, a restaurant, food kiosks, and an arcade.  Despite its initial success, the park's popularity began to decline at the turn of the century.

In 2002, the park closed for a four-month facelift, later reopening with new facilities such as a bicycle kiosk and a dive school. In 2006, it closed for further development, reopening two years later in 2008 with the water slides dismantled and the rest of the compound refurbished into a dining and lifestyle destination. At present, the park now known as Playground at Big Splash, is home to a smorgasbord of dining options instead â€“ from fast food outlets and casual cafes, to posh restaurants and bars, alongside an inline skating school, mini-golf course and gym.

The troupe was led by two voluntary instructors Mr Lim Hiang Ghee (æž—é¦™ä»ª) and Mr Chan Yew Hamï¼ˆé™ˆè€€é’¦ï¼‰who were veteran professional circus acrobatic cycling performers during the 1930s-1940s.
From the 1950s to 1980s, the troupe trained more than a hundred acrobatic cyclists, and on average the troupe had eight to ten performances every year. It was during the 1980s, that the troupe enjoyed its peak and was invited to perform in national events such as the National Day Parade, Chingay procession, charity shows as well as many other school and community events.
The Kong Chow Clan Acrobatic Cycling Troupe was formed in 1957 and was well known for their acrobatic cycling stunts and performances.

The troupe had an impressive repertoire of up to 20 acrobatic cycling stunts involving unicycles and bicycles. These stunts included â€œA Single Dragonâ€ (ä¸€æ¡é¾™), â€ Crossing Three Obstaclesâ€ (è¿‡ä¸‰å…³) and â€œCycling around in Bagua Diagramâ€ ( èµ°å…«å¦).

However, the troupe's most challenging and most popular stunt was the â€œPile-Up Artsâ€ (å ç½—æ±‰) which involved 9 members â€œstacking-upâ€ from a single rider on the bicycle. As a result of its success, the troupe and its acrobatic cycling routines became the Kong Chow Clan's pride and icon as it was a troupe that was unique to the clan.

During the early 1980s, as a result of the global success of the movie â€œE.T. The Extra-Terrestrialâ€ and its bike riding scenes, many youths in Singapore were inspired to take up acrobatic cycling. As a result, by 1984, there were up to 50 acrobatic cycling troupes or teams all across Singapore and professional acrobatic cyclists from Kong Chow Clan started teaching and sharing their skills with these troupes or teams.
However, the acrobatic cycling trend did not last as Singaporean youths started gravitating towards new trends such as break-dancing and by the 1990s, the acrobatic cycling troupe in Kong Chow Clan was disbanded.
Mr. Chia Kum Loke (è°¢é”¦ä¹), age 74, is one of the pioneer members of the acrobatic cycling troupe. He was only 15 years old when he joined Kong Chow Clan and started practicing Chinese martial arts and lion dance at the clan. As a result of his youth, fitness and bravery, he was always selected to be the person to climb to the top during the â€œPile-up Artsâ€ routine. Since then, Mr. Chia learned all of the acrobatic cycling routines and imparted the routines to new members of the troupe.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2016
At the heart of the Singapore River sits the myth of the Singapore Stone and strongman Badang, a mysterious legend from Singapore's past found in the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), a chronicle of the Malay courts of Singapore and Melaka from the 14th and 16th centuries.
Fragment of the Singapore Stone currently on display at the National Museum of Singapore, 10th to 14th century. Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
Most Singaporeans are probably unfamiliar with the story of the Singapore Stone, and I myself was no exception. With the popularisation of Western stories such as fairy tales from the Grimm Brothers, Singapore's rich cultural reservoir of folklore and legends might seem to pale in comparison. They are, however, worthy of holding their own. Many other notable folk stories are also found in the Sejarah Melayu, such as the legend of Bukit Merah, as well as the founding of Singapura by Sang Nila Utama.
Manuscript version of the Sejarah Melayu, 1896; the earliest known version was written in 1612. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Folklore is not only a great source of entertainment, but also provides insight into the culture, traditions, values and even language of the kingdom that called this land home before us. To me, it is fascinating that a physical piece of this nearly five hundred-year-old legend still survives, yet its stories are not already common knowledge to us. They story of the Singapore Stone holds important clues to what life was like in Singapura before Raffles, and allows us to extend our knowledge and appreciation of the very long journey that our island has traversed. The possibility of Singapore having its own local ancient tales worth retelling spurred me to find out more about the myths surrounding this mysterious stone and Badang.
The Strongman Badang
The earliest record of the story of strongman Badang can be found in the Sejarah Melayu, which is still considered a fundamental text of Malay history today.
According to one version of the folklore, Badang was a slave who worked to clear the forest for his owner. One day, Badang caught a genie in his fishing net at the Singapore River and the genie agreed to grant Badang one wish in exchange for his release. Thinking it would help him in his work, Badang asked to be the strongest man in the land. The genie told Badang that he had to eat his vomit if he wanted strength, so Badang ate the genie's vomit and became very strong. He was even able to uproot trees effortlessly.

Badang's immense strength caught the attention of King Seri Rana Wikrama and he was eventually summoned to court and appointed the commander-in-chief of the army. His strength also drew the attention of other regional leaders such as one of the kings in India, who sent his country's own champion, Nadi Bijaya Pikrama, to the Malay Archipelago to compete with Badang. The winner of the duel would be the one who could lift a large rock in front of the palace. Nadi managed to lift the stone up before dropping it. Badang lifted up the stone and flung it towards the Singapore River, where it lay for a very long time and became known as the Singapore Stone.

THE SINGAPORE STONE
The Singapore Stone once stood at the mouth of the Singapore River. The huge sandstone was believed to span three metres in both height and width. One the face of the slab were 50 lines of inscription measuring 1.5 metres in height and 2.1 metres in width. The inscription, which could hold secrets to Singapore's history, is in Kawi script and contains some Sanskrit words, but has not been fully deciphered. The Stone has been dated from the 10th to the 14th century, and is believed to be the oldest record of writing found in Singapore.
Drawings of three fragments from the Singapore Stone, from Laidlay's 1848 article in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal. The last fragment (labelled Fig 3) is now on display at the National Museum of Singapore.
In 1843, the British blew up the Stone to build Fort Fullerton and colonial living quarters. Only one of the three fragments of the stone remains, measuring about 74cm in width. This is currently on display at the National Museum of Singapore and will be featured in this year's National Day Parade.
Preserving Our Heritage
The legend of the Singapore Stone serves as a reminder that economic development and modernity does not have to come at the expense of our history. As Singapore steps into the next 50 years of her independence, we write new chapters where heritage and advancement co-exist and complement each other. While the Singapore Stone and the story of Badang still has a fragment that stands testimony to their legacy, we may not be as fortunate regarding other local folklore and traditions. Hence, it is up to us, the people of Singapore, to preserve and pass down these Singapore stories to future generations to better appreciate our history and heritage.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 â€“ Apr to Jun 2016
Radio, when it first arrived, produced a unique acoustic space and created a new aural experience. Like other colonial technologies such as the gramophone and cinema, it created a new and distinct form of entertainment in Singapore. Besides broadening people's imagination, radio also created a vast community â€“ one that crossed the boundaries of age, ethnicity, gender and nationality.
In 2016, the National Museum of Singapore's exhibition Celebrating Radio: Sounds from the Past thematically charted some of the significant phases of Singapore's broadcasting history, from 1930s to 1980s. The audience was treated to a rich soundscape comprising live commentaries, folk theatre, jingles, music, slogans, stories and speeches, which complemented the narrative.
Listening to the radio was a common pastime for children from the 1950s to 1970s. Children's programmes included educational storytelling, song dedications, radio plays and live performances by young artists. In a specially designed interactive space within the exhibition, children entered the immersive environment of a broadcasting room. Engaging through imagination and drama, children could role-play a radio broadcaster, read stories aloud and make song dedications. Outside the broadcasting room, parents and children could design their own vinyl records or make vintage radio boxes for a donation of $2. They could also try their hand at creating sound effects.
Amateur Experiments (1930s to 1940s)
Radio broadcasting in Malaya began as an amateur, experimental and private endeavour. In Singapore, there were the Amateur Wireless Society of Malaya (1924 to 1928) and Radio Service Company of Malaya's ZHI (1933 to 1936). Besides news bulletins and talks, the ZHI broadcasted both gramophone and live music from local dance halls.
Invented in 1877, the phonograph or gramophone is a device that allows both the recording and reproduction of sound. Pictured here is a phonograph produced by the Aeolian Company. These Aeolian phonographs usually came with a patented feature â€“ the graduola, a cable that allowed the volume to be controlled from a distance.

With the government's decision to issue broadcasting licenses, radio services became more structured and regulated. The British Malaya Broadcasting Corporation (BMBC), a private company based in Singapore, started medium wave transmission in 1937. However, the onset of World War II created another set of challenges.
Medium of Control (1940 to 1946)
Both the British and Japanese governments understood radio's ability to reach large audiences. A new department to publicise Britain's war efforts and dispel enemy claims was created in 1939. The government purchased BMBC in 1940, renamed it Malayan Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), and enhanced radio facilities.
The BMBC studios were located within the Cathay Building on Handy Road, which was designed by Frank Brewer. The building also housed a cinema, hotel and restaurant, and was Singapore's tallest building in the 1940s. Its history intersects with that of radio, as news about the advancing Japanese was announced from the BMBC studios. During the war, the Japanese took over the building and used it for its Broadcasting, Propaganda and Military Information departments.

During the Japanese Occupation (1942 to 1945), the function of radio changed. More than a source of power, it was also a medium to control the population. Radio became the chief means to spread the Japanese language, through which listeners were persuaded to accept the larger cultural superiority of Japan.

Radio for Developing Society (1946 to1959)
The nature of broadcasting in Singapore changed after British rule was restored. To fight threats from various insurgents, radio was used to spread political awareness, as well as inform and educate the wider population. Farther out, villages, estates and tin-mining areas began to experience radio. In 1946, the government formed the Pan-Malayan Department of Broadcasting, known on air as Radio Malaya. The Singapore-based station provided programmes for the entire Malay Peninsula. On January 1, 1959, the Singapore station was renamed Radio Singapura, while the Federation's services continued to be known as Radio Malaya.
Radio and Nation Building (1959 to 1965)
Radio in postcolonial Singapore served as a stage for political theatre and facilitated nation building. The persuasive power and reach of the media was utilised by the edgling government under the People's Action Party. As early as 1957, one of the Party's founders, S. Rajaratnam, wrote a six-part radio play titled A Nation in the Making. This dialogue-based play was aired on Radio Malaya and articulated Rajaratnam's views on Malayan identity.
n 1961, Singapore's then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew wrote and delivered a series of 12 weekly talks on the topic of merger, which was broadcasted in English, Malay and Mandarin.

Radio was instrumental in educating listeners about Malay, the national language. Malay was meant to foster a common identity among Singaporeans. The Ministry of Culture published a multilingual booklet containing 16 lessons that were broadcast from April 11 to June 1, 1960.

After Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, broadcasting services were reorganised. Radio Malaysia was created, with its headquarters based in Kuala Lumpur, while Radio Singapura remained here. In that same year, Television Singapura was launched as Singapore's first television station. After independence in 1965, Radio Singapura and Television Singapura merged to form Radio Television Singapura (RTS) as a department under the Ministry of Culture.
Voice of the Nation (1960s to1980s)
Radio played a major role in shaping postcolonial Singapore. The multilingual nature of radio programming in Singapore strengthened vernacular traditions, particularly in drama and music. Programmes often highlighted local experiences and attempted to articulate the Singapore identity. Traditions such as storytelling were also facilitated by radio. Several well-known Rediffusion storytellers turned the dramatisation of written text into a fine art. Rediffusion (Singapore) Pte Ltd started its services in 1949, broadcasting entertainment materials in Malay, English, Mandarin and Chinese dialects.

In order to generate finances for broadcasting, commercial advertising was introduced in 1960. In 1980, RTS was renamed Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC). As a statutory board, SBC was tasked with providing information, education and entertainment. Radio services were augmented to include FM stereo services, a new Radio Programmes Division and programming adapted to nine channels in English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.
Transistor Radios
Transistor radios altered the way radios were used. While large radios encouraged families to gather and listen to programmes together, portable transistors were sources of personalised leisure. As mass produced items, they were affordable. Compact radios with simple controls and attractive casings became favoured consumer items. This was until portable cassette and CD players that offered better sound quality emerged in the 1980s.

Radio and Popular Music
Broadcasting both local and international music, radio in Singapore inspired many to make music. Their songs were in turn popularised on the radio, producing several local celebrities. One of the most successful local shows was Radio Malaya's Talentime. First aired in 1949 and hosted by Kingsley Morrando, the show became a popular platform for local talent. In the 1950s, the popularity of radio and the invention of the electric guitar in America introduced listeners in Singapore to jazz, rhythm and blues, swing, and rock and roll. Listening to these musical styles encouraged young people to create local bands and produce original content.

Singapore's Healthcare System in the 1800s
From the 1800s to the first half of the 1900s, traditional medical practices as well as home remedies were the primary means of healthcare for non-European communities in Singapore. During this period, the Chinese sought medical treatment from sinsehs (traditional Chinese physicians), the Malays from bomohs or dukans (shamans) while the Indians relied on Ayurvedic medicine.
Western medical practices arrived in Singapore in 1819 when Thomas Prendergast, a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, landed on the island with Sir Stamford Raffles. Joined later by William Montgomerie, an Assistant Surgeon, the two men attended to the medical needs of the European community and their troops. The appointment of the first rural health officer in the late 1830s marked the beginning of organised public health services in Singapore.
In October 1830, Thomas Oxley was appointed Assistant Surgeon in Singapore, and was head of the medical department from 1844 to 1857. The Municipal Health Department was subsequently established in 1887 to manage the increased need for health services within the city area, and the Rural and Urban Health Authorities was established in 1896 to oversee sanitation and the administration of health laws. In 1890, the Straits Medical Association was established by Sir Dr David James Galloway for local medical practitioners to discuss and conduct research on local diseases.
The first steps toward the prevention and control of infectious diseases were adopted by the British government in the 1860s through the introduction of laws on vaccination, quarantine and registration of births and deaths. In 1868, the Vaccination Ordinance was enacted and smallpox vaccination was made compulsory with effect from 1 May 1869. Yet, public health measures were still inadequate at the turn of the century and the rate of mortality in Singapore remained high.

This is a portrait of Dr W R C Middleton who served as Singapore's Municipal Health Officer (1893 to 1920). He did much to improve the living conditions then and curtail the spreading of serious diseases as cholera.


Early Hospitals in Singapore
The Singapore General Hospital (then known as the General Hospital) (SGH) is the first hospital built on the island and started as a humble wooden shed in a British military camp in the vicinity of Bras Basah Road and Stamford Road. Through the years, the hospital relocated to several sites and underwent several name changes before finally settling at its present location at Outram Road during the 1880s.
Known as See Pai Poh (æ–½æŽ’åŸ”) amongst the Chinese community, it was rebuilt twice on the same site during the 1900s. Officially opened on 29 March 1926 by Sir Lawrence Nunns Gullemard, then Governor of the Straits Settlement, SGH was the only hospital back then that had ""Singapore"" in its name which affirmed its status as the country's premier hospital.
In addition to SGH, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) is another of Singapore's oldest hospitals and was initially known as the Chinese Pauper Hospital. The foundation stone for the first TTSH building was laid on Pearl's Hill on 25 May 1844 after Tan Tock Seng, a wealthy businessman, contributed 5,000 dollars to fund its construction cost. TTSH shifted locations thrice before moving to its current site at Jalan Tan Tock Seng.
Kandang Kerbau (KK) Woman's and Children's Hospital (KKH) started in 1858 with the establishment of the fifth General Hospital in Kandang Kerbau. For more than six decades, KKH served different purposes and underwent several name changes before it finally became a maternity hospital in 1924. From the 1950s to the 1970s, KKH was the world's busiest maternity hospital and achieved a historical high of 39,835 deliveries in 1966.

The hospital started off in 1819 as a shed in the cantonment near Bras Basah Road and Stamford Road to provide medical attention to the early inhabitants of Singapore.





Other Healthcare Institutions in the 1800s
Singapore's first maternity hospital opened on 1 January 1888 at the junction of Victoria Street and Stamford Canal with a capacity of eight beds. It was replaced by the new Maternity Block at the General Hospital which commenced operations in 1908, and subsequently re-opened as the Free Maternity Hospital in 1914. The hospital closed down on 1 October 1924 on the day KKH opened its doors.
Built in 1841, the Insane Hospital was the first psychiatric facility in Singapore and it started with 30 beds. Located at the junction of Bras Basah Road and Bencoolen Street, the hospital grew to accommodate 130 males and 1 female by 1860. In 1861, the hospital moved to a site near the fifth General Hospital in Kandang Kerbau and was renamed Lunatic Asylum. The asylum relocated to a 300 bed facility at Sepoy Lines in 1887 following a cholera outbreak at the previous asylum and the new asylum was renamed New Lunatic Asylum.
In addition to public healthcare institutions, there were other private non-profit healthcare institutions such as Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution (formerly known as Thong Chai Yee Say). Established in 1867 by a group of Chinese immigrants to provide free medical treatment for the needy, the institution is the oldest Chinese medical institution in Singapore. It originally operated out of rented shophouse at 31 Upper Pickering Street before relocating to 50 Eu Tong Sen Street in 1892 and subsequently to a new 10 storey building at Chin Swee Road in 1976.

Home to the first free traditional Chinese medical clinic for the poor in Singapore, the Former Thong Chai Medical Institution testifies to the Chinese pioneers' spirit of mutual assistance and their generosity towards the poor and needy.




Singapore's Healthcare System from 1900 to pre-1965
The colonial government introduced a series of healthcare services in the early 1900s and these included the Maternal and Child Health Service in 1907, the School Health Service in 1921 and Singapore's first public dental clinic in 1929. However, traditional medicine and medical practices remained the primary means of healthcare for the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities during the first half of the 1900s.
During the 1940s, the development of Singapore's healthcare system was disrupted by the World War II and the Japanese Occupation. In the early post-war years, malnourishment was rife, infant mortality rate was high and infectious diseases continued to be widespread. The colonial government, however, acted expediently to restore the public health system and the health of the general population gradually returned to pre-war levels by the late 1940s.
The colonial government also approved a 10-year Medical Plan formulated by Dr W J Vickers (then Director of Medical Services) in 1948. The priorities outlined in the aforementioned plan included the establishment of more maternity and child clinics; the expansion and modernisation of hospitals; the development of school clinics; and mass immunisation against infectious diseases. In 1950, a notable advancement in health measures on the islands off Singapore was made with the launch of a floating dispensary.
Following the attainment of self-governance in 1959, all medical and health services in Singapore were reorganised and unified under the administration of the Ministry of Health in 1961. In 1962, the government introduced mandatory immunisation against diphtheria and other nationwide immunisation exercises included the anti-tuberculosis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination for newborns in 1957.

Healthcare Institutions and Associations in Early Singapore
The 1900s witnessed the establishment of several military hospitals in Singapore and they included Alexandra Hospital (formerly known as British or Alexandra Military Hospital) (1940); Sembawang Hospital (formerly known as Naval Base Hospital) (late 1920s to early 1930s); and Changi Hospital (formerly known as Royal Air Force Hospital) (1935). It is worthwhile to note that at the time Alexandra Hospital was established, it was the largest and best-equipped hospital in the British Far East Command.
In addition to military hospitals, a number of public and private hospitals were established during this period. Examples of public hospitals established then included Toa Payoh Hospital (formerly known as Thomson Road Hospital) in 1959 and Middle Road Hospital in 1945 while examples of private hospitals included Gleneagles Hospital (1959) and Parkway East Hospital (1930s).
Located at Yio Chu Kang, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) (formerly known as the Mental Hospital) was established in 1928 and replaced the New Lunatic Asylum. In 1951, the hospital was renamed as Woodbridge Hospital in an attempt to remove the stigma associated with mentally ill patients. In 1993, the hospital moved to Buangkok View and it was renamed as IMH to reflect its emphasis on research, training and mental health education.
It was also during the 1900s that a number of non-profit healthcare institutions were established, and examples included St Andrew's Mission Hospital (1923) which started as a dispensary for women and children; Mount Alvernia Hospital (1961) which was founded by a group of nuns from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood; and the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (1910) which was founded by a group of Cantonese merchants to provide free medical care to Cantonese immigrants.

In 1938, the British built the former British Military Hospital to serve as a principal hospital for the British in Asia.






Singapore's Healthcare System post-1965
After Singapore attained independence in 1965, the government continued to step up its efforts to improve the quality of healthcare on the island. It was during this period that Western medicine and medical practices gradually overtook traditional medicine and medical practices as the primary means of healthcare and the majority of the population.
In addition, many nationwide health campaigns were introduced to address the country's health issues, and these campaigns included the Family Planning Campaign and the Dental Health Campaign launched during the 1960s, National Heart Week in the 1970s and the National Smoking Control Programme in the 1980s.
The Family Planning Campaign was a three-month campaign launched to raise awareness of the need for family planning and the disadvantages of large unplanned families. Its slogan of ""Two is Enough"" is well remembered by Singaporeans born in the 1970s (or earlier) and it was so effective that fertility rate in Singapore fell from over four children per female in 1965 to less than two in the 1980s.
The Dental Health Campaign was launched in 1969 and as part of the campaign, students were supplied with a toothbrush and a plastic mug (for 25 cents) and compulsory brushing of teeth was introduced in all primary schools (usually after recess and conducted along drains) to inculcate in students the habit of brushing teeth daily using proper techniques.
During this period, a number of public and private hospitals were also established. The former included the National University Hospital (1985) which continues to serve as the principal teaching hospital for the National University of Singapore's medical and dental faculties while the latter included Mount Elizabeth Hospital (1979), one of the largest private hospitals in Singapore, and the former Thomson Medical Centre (1979) (now known as Thomson Medical Pte Ltd).
Singapore's first comprehensive National Health Plan which outlined a preventive approach towards health management was introduced in 1983. At the heart of the plan was Medisave, the first of its kind in the world, which was implemented in 1984. The scheme is a compulsory national savings scheme that requires each Singaporean working adult to set aside a part of his/her income to meet future medical expenses.
The government also started the journey of restructuring all public hospitals in Singapore during the 1980s to grant hospitals greater autonomy in delivering improved services to patients in an efficient manner.

Singapore's Healthcare System: 1990s and Beyond
During the 1990s, the White Paper titled ""Affordable Health Care"" was introduced to address the issue of escalating healthcare costs and to serve as a blueprint for developing Singapore's healthcare system for the 21st century.
The 1900s and 2000s also saw the introduction of MediSave (1984), MediShield (1990) and MediShield Plus (1994) which are key components of the national medical insurance scheme. Medifund (1993) and Medifund Silver (2007), both endowment funds targeted to help Singaporeans who do not have enough money to pay for their medical expenses, were also launched as part of the government's public assistance schemes.
Unveiled in 2012, the Healthcare 2020 Master Plan encompasses a set of strategies to transform Singapore's healthcare system so as to enhance the accessibility and quality of healthcare for all Singaporeans. These strategies include the reorganisation of the healthcare system into Regional Health Systems to provide integrated care and the introduction of outpatient team-based care for patients.
Major steps have also been taken since 2012 to keep healthcare affordable. These include the expansion of the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) to offer subsidised outpatient care at private General Practitioners (GPs) and dental clinics to middle and low-income Singaporeans aged 40 and above; and the introduction of the Pioneer Generation Package which offers healthcare benefits for Singapore's pioneers.

Public Hospitals and Specialist Centres
Changi General Hospital (CGH) was opened in 1998 and became Singapore's first purpose-built general hospital to serve communities in the east and northeast regions. It replaced the Changi Hospital and Toa Payoh Hospital, both of which ceased operations in early 1997. During the mid-2000s, CGH became the first regional general hospital which had a community hospital, St Andrew Community Hospital, located next to it.
Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, opened in 2010, is another regional general hospital ""twinned"" with the Yishun Community Hospital and focuses on serving the northern region of Singapore. Likewise, the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital is be the regional hospital for the Jurong area and it is ""twinned"" with the Jurong Community Hospital.
As part of the Healthcare 2020 Master Plan announced in 2012, a number of new hospitals will be established over time to meet the projected long-term demand for healthcare services and these new hospitals include both Sengkang General Hospital and Sengkang Community Hospital as well as an integrated hospital hub with the Yishun Community Hospital, Admiralty Medical Centre and Woodlands Integrated Healthcare Campus (to be opened in phases from 2022).
In addition, to address the growing need for specialised treatments, a number of specialist centres were established and they included the Singapore National Eye Centre (1990), the Singapore Heart Centre (1994), the National Dental Centre (1997), the National Neuroscience Institute (1999) and the National Cancer Centre Singapore (2000).

""It's a bright and early morning at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and I am going about my usual fieldwork when I hear a ruckus going on at a nearby tree. Walking over, I see a flurry of activity: long-tailed macaques are hopping from branch to branch, plantain squirrls are scurrying about, and a variety of birds are flocking to a great big tree that is covered with thousands of small, red, juicy fruit. It's a feeding frenzy, and the host?""
- A Fabulous Fig Tree

Figs (or Ficus as this group of trees are known in Latin to botanists) are often touted as ""keystone species"", which means that these trees play a disproportionately large role in the lives of many creatures in an ecosystem. One key reason for this significance is that fig trees provide food for a great number of other animals in the forest. One research study has found that over 1,270 species of mammals and birds, as well as a number of reptiles and fish, feed on figs to varying degrees (Shanahan et al. 2001). In addition, many other tropical rainforest trees are seasonal, producing fruit only in certain months or even certain years, whereas figs bear fruit all-year round, thus providing reliable and nutritious source of food for forest-dwelling birds and other beasts.
A fruit with a long history
Wild figs have existed for millions of years but their use in agriculture by our ancestors appears to have originated as far back as 11,400 years ago in the Near East. This was established in 2006 by archaeologists from Israel and the United States who found the remnants of dried figs at an archaeological site in the Jordan Valley (Kislev et al. 2006). Their discovery, which was published in the journal Science, suggests that figs were being used in agriculture even before olives and grapes, making them the oldest cultivated fruits to date
Most figs that are cultivated by mankind are varieties of a single species, Ficus carica, also known as the Common Fig. The name carica comes from Caria, a region in Asia Minor that is now part of Turkey. Turkey is the world's large producer of figs, accounting for approximately 27% of the total production of figs, followed by Egypt, then the USA. In Asia, figs are cultivated in Japan and China, but these are mostly retained for the domestic market. The cultivation of figs and the recognition of their nutritious quality have helped spread the fig far and wide. Today, figs are found wherever the weather permits and are cultivated in regions outside their native range like France and California

Trees that depend on tiny wasps
Despite their widespread cultivation and popularity as culinary treats, few people are aware that aside from Ficus carica, there are more than 700 species of figs worldwide. Approximately 500 species can be found in Australasia, making this region the most diverse for figs. Some of the most well-known local trees are figs; readers are surely familiar with Banyans or Strangler Figs (Ficus benjamina or Ficus microcarpa), which begin life as tiny seeds deposited on the branch of another, already mature, tree by a passing bird. The fig sapling then sprouts and sends down roots towards the ground. These aerial roots, which confer a rather spooky atmosphere to these figs, later thicken and â€˜strangle' the host tree, which dies off. The Banyan that remains forms a thick canopy with a dense latticework of roots, which provide ample habitat for other plants and animals. In the ruins of the Angkor Wat complex in Cambodia, large strangler figs have taken over some temple compounds, their roots enveloping the ancient stone walls and gopurams with a layer of living wood.
Another little-known fact about figs is that these magnificent, life-giving trees are completely dependent on tiny wasps measuring just a few millimetres in length, which are the only insects able to successfully pollinate their flowers. These fig wasps are very different from the hornets and other social wasps that visit flowers in parks and gardens and nest in elaborate hives; fig wasps do not feed as adults, lack stings and are totally harmless to humans; in fact, without fig wasps, we would have no figs at all.
Figs and fig wasps share what is known to ecologists as a reciprocal obligate mutualism. This means that both partners cannot reproduce without the other. The relationship is made more complex by the fact that approximately two-thirds of all fig species have a one-to-one relationship whereby each species of fig tree can only be pollinated by a single species of fig wasp. Thus, the extinction of the pollinator would mean the extinction of its associated fig tree as well.
The Chinese refer to figs as â€˜Wu hua guo' or â€˜flowerless fruit', a name which aptly describes the distinctive reproductive features of figs. Instead of showy flowers that bloom in the open from the tips of branches, figs produce an enclosed receptacle that is full of hundreds of tiny individual florets. This receptacle, called the syconium, is often thought to be the fruit, but it is not a fruit until pollination has taken place.
At the bottom of this receptacle, keen observers will see a tiny entrance called the ostiole. This hole serves to allow the female fig wasp to enter the syconium. She then proceeds to simultaneously pollinate the fig and lay her eggs. Her offspring, when they finally emerge as adults, will then mate with each other within the syconium. The male wasps die after mating, but the mated female will exit the syconium via the ostiole, carrying pollen on her body as she flies off to find other figs of the same species. When she reaches and enters a new syconium, the pollen on her body fertilises the fig and the life-cycles of both tree and wasp are repeated. In the meantime, the pollinated florets in the syconium will ripen and turn the receptacle into a delectable fruit enjoyed by humans and frugivorous animals. In short, the fig tree provides a nest for the offspring of the fig wasp, and in return the fig wasp pollinates the flowers of the fig. It is a mutualism that has lasted over 60 millions years and ensured the survival of both groups of organisms.
Cut into half, the Golden Hairy Fig (Ficus aurata) shows a fig wasp making its way around the florets in the syconium. As the fig wasp wanders inside the fig, she picks up pollen which will pollinate other figs she visits. Photo by author.

In Singapore, figs are the second large genus of woody plants with 48 recorded native species, of which 32 (66%) are considered critically endangered or nationally extinct (Chong et al. 2009). This is largely the result of deforestation, which has replaced nearly all of the island's original vegetation with urban spaces that support only a handful of hardy fig species such as Banyans. Another, more pervasive, threat to the survival of all species of figs is the possibility that their tiny pollinators will go extinct. A study carried out by my colleagues and myself using four species of fig wasps found in Singapore suggests that climate warming may not bode well for the short-lived tiny pollinators, as the projected increases in temperature expected for the tropics may shorten the lifespan of fig wasps by 33-60%. (Jevanandam et al. 2013). For an insect that already has a brief adult lifespan of just 1-2 days, this means a drastic reduction in the time it has to mate, locate a suitable fig, lay eggs and pollinate the florets. Over time, the reduction or absence of pollination services would lead to fewer ripe figs, and in turn both urban and wild animals may be adversely affected as they would lose a valuable source of food.
Figs in culture and cultivation
Unlike animals in the wild, people are luckier since most of the appetising figs that end up in our stores and on our plates are parthenocarpic, which means that the fig ripens on its own without pollination. Most of the figs commercially cultivated in California are of this type, while those in the Middle East are a combination of wasp-pollinated and parthenocarpic cultivars.
Due to their sweetness, nutritious value and abundant crops, figs play an important role as a food resource in many cultures around the world. Dried figs are an excellent source of minerals, vitamins and anti-oxidants. In fact, dried fruits are concentrated sources of energy, with each 100 grams of dried figs providing approximately 249 calories. Fresh figs, on the other hand, contain antioxidants such as vitamins A, E, and K. Both dried and fresh figs have a high calcium content and rank second after oranges in terms of calcium content in fruits.
Even today, figs continue to play an important role in food and nutrition. This is most evident during the month of Ramadan when Muslims from around the world including Singapore break their daily fast with a combination of figs, honey, dates, olives and bread.
In traditional Chinese medicine, dried figs are used as an ingredient in tonics to help strengthen the lungs and relieve coughs. In Western cuisine, dried figs are popular as healthy, energy-rich snacks like the fig newton, which is a widely consumed pastry roll filled with fig paste. Figs are also made into jams, preserves, biscuits and confections such as Turkish baklava. The dried leaves of one native fig, Ficus auriculata, can be used to make a medicinal tea
The fig's significance does not just end with it being an easy-to-consume, nutritious food. These trees also have a strong religious significance in the East. It is said that Buddha found enlightenment while meditating under a Bodhi Tree, which is believed to be Ficus religiosa, a fig native to India but which has been introduced to Singapore. And so throughout countries where Buddhism prevails, like India, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Singapore, figs are revered and often planted as a religious symbol and worshiped in the absence of proper temples. When I was travelling in Thailand, a number of restaurants I dined at had a pressed leaf of Ficus religiosa on the first page of their menus, an indication of the deep-seated religious significance the fig tree holds in Thai culture.

But the bold, ubiquitous fig doesn't hold back and has ventured beyond Islam and Buddhism into Christianity. It has been argued by some scholars that the forbidden fruit, which Adam and Eve consumed in the Garden of Eden, was the fig and not the apple. And that the leaves of the fig were used to cover Adam and Eve when they realised that they were naked. The most famous depiction of the fig as the forbidden fruit was painted by the Italian artist Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) in his masterpiece fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.
Figs in various forms
Not all figs grow to become massive trees like the Banyan or Bodhi. Figs exhibit different growth forms that include climbers, shrubs, average-sized trees and large trees which reach well above the canopy. Many of these forms are found in Singapore. One large native fig tree is the Common Red Stem Fig (Ficus variegata), which can grow up to 40 metres high and is found mainly in parks and nature reserves. There is one specimen in the Botanic Gardens growing near the visitor centre, which can be recognised by the bright red figs growing in clusters from the trunk. Another native fig species, Ficus punctata, is a woody climber that can be found extensively along Holland Road on the side of Botanic Gardens. This species is easy to spot when it is figging as the figs look like oranges. A very common roadside shrub is the White-leaved Fig (Ficus grossu-larioides) which often attracts bulbuls, green pigeons, black-naped orioles and Asian koels among other birds. These species and more dot our urban landscape and provide sustenance for our urban fauna. As a result, the possible loss or reduced abundance of figs from the landscape should be of major conservation concern. Their value in our concrete jungle is perhaps most appreciated by local bird watchers and photographers who often flock to figging trees in anticipation of the huge variety of birds that visit these trees to feed.

Some of the figs found in Singapore are 120 to 160 years old as of 2013. Fortunately, the National Parks Board's Heritage Tree Scheme, which began in 2001, identifies and conserves mature trees that are rare and have historical significance. There were 199 trees on the list in 2013, of which 34 were figs consisting of eight species. In particular, a 120-year old heritage fig tree at Sentosa Island was made a star when it received much media attention after being featured in a 2001 film, The Tree, starring popular local actress Zoe Tay.
And so it is, food, faith and controversy define the fig's story, making it a â€˜keystone' in more ways than one. Like the roots of its own great Banyans, the magnificent Ficus in all its forms and habits has firmly intertwined itself into the lives of both people and wildlife. Given that more than half our 48 native species are endangered or extinct, no effort should be spared in conserving them. The next time you walk past a fig, take a moment to stop, observe the many birds, monkeys and squirrels that feast on its fruit, and appreciate how this natural bounty is the result of a complex yet fragile relationship with a tiny wasp that not many people have heard of and few have seen.
The Fabulous Figs of Singapore, which inspired this article's title, is an excellent pocket book written by local fig enthusiasts. It provides a list of fig species found in Singapore with pictures, helpful descriptions and locations of notable trees. Available at good book stores, this is an informative little book I used when I first started out on my journey into the world of figs.

Before the extensive land reclamation project that began in the 1960s, the seashore was right outside many of the houses still seen today, including the popular Hua Yu Wee restaurant, which retains its original steps that used to lead to the beach.

The East Coast of the first half of the twentieth century was what we now know as Bedok and its surrounding areas. Singapore Memory Project contributor Bernard Han shares: â€œBefore Marine Parade was reclaimed, the beach used to be along Marine Parade Road, just behind the courtyard of the Grand Hotel â€“ a place where children could really grow up by the sea.â€
Bedok was one of the earliest documented places in Singapore, as seen from a 1604 map referring to Sungei Bedok (Bedok River) as Sunebodo.

 As to how the name came about, one view is that it derives from the Malay word bedoh, a wooden drum formerly used to issue the Islamic call to prayer. Another links Bedok to the word biduk, a riverine fishing boat.

Bedok grew around the river and the coast as a series of villages. Each village had its own unique story. Chai Chee's name refers in Hokkien to a vegetable market, which is what it first began as. Heritage blogger Yeo Hong Eng remembers: â€œAs soon as we moved there, acquaintances were forged. There was the fishmonger, Mr Lee Tng, from Chai Chee market... His well constantly supplied the neighbours with cool refreshing water. He invited us to use his well water which we did until we got portable pipe water.â€
Kampong Bedok was situated at the crossroads of Bedok Road and Upper East Coast Road and is an area still affectionately known as Bedok Corner. Ronald Ho, who was born there, shares his memories: â€œIt was the best days of my life living in Bedok Village... we owned nothing of luxury but we led a most colourful childhood. From climbing trees searching for fruits to attempting to swim in the sand mines at Koh Sek Lim Road, our afternoons were never lonely or dull.â€

Bedok of the past included Siglap, which also comes from the Malay word si-gelap (â€œdark oneâ€), likely refering to either an eclipse at the time of its founding or the thick canopy of coconut trees in the area. The village's founder was Tok Lasam, believed to be an Indonesian royal fleeing from the Dutch. Today his tombstone is located in Siglap. Mrs Rita Fernando speaks of her experiences living in the village: â€œFor us, I would say there really was no difference in race. We did not even think of ourselves as Singaporeans then, because we were just emerging from colonial rule. We just lived as kampong people and neighbours and we shared whatever we had.â€
Tanah Merah, also part of the larger Bedok in the past, literally means â€œred cliffsâ€ in Malay, referring to the seaside cliffs of reddish clay-like soil that characterised the area. Heritage blogger Jerome Lim reflects: â€œMarked by a landscape that would seem out of place in the Singapore of today with its terrain that undulated with cliffs that overlooked the sea, the area was decorated with gorgeous seaside villas and attap-roofed wooden huts of coastal villages that provided a laidback feel to the surroundings...â€ In stark contrast, the Tanah Merah area was also fortified with artillery guns and pillboxes from which soldiers could shoot enemies approaching from the sea.

Surviving fragments of old seawalls tell of the evolution of the east's character and physical landscape. Two of these seawalls can be found behind Elliot Walk and along Nallur Road today, indicating the former coastline. As Bedok was close to the sea, it was not surprising that many made their living from this water- side advantage. Fishermen would haul their catch of local fish such as scad, wolf herring and mackerel from the shore to Siglap Market for sale. Others toiled the land, farming tapioca, vegetables, and collecting coconut and nipah palms. Harvests were then transported via old Changi Road to nearby Chai Chee for sale.

Along these low-lying areas, floods however were a frequent occurrence. Former Siglap resident Felicia Goh shares: â€œWhenever there were heavy showers, we would have to watch out for floods and bring our furniture to the second floor. It was fun for us kids as we could play water officially!â€

Fire, too, did not spare these areas. In a 1962 blaze, 500 Siglap residents saw their kampong ravaged by flames on Chinese New Year's day â€“ the result of firecrackers landing on flammable attap roofs. Long-time resident Goh Chiang Siang shared that affected families had to be resettled to temporary housing nearby. Former bank officer Aloysius Leo De Conceicao also recalled how the neighbouring kampongs united to put out the fire: â€œI remember everybody from the neighbourhood came out to help the fire brigade and firemen because they had a bit of difficulty getting the water. It was sad because it was during the festive season.â€

Seaside and water activities were part of the area's recreational highlights. Bedok Beach (the coastal stretch from Upper East Coast Road to Bedok Corner) was the site of holiday accommodations and restaurants. This lifestyle was enjoyed by residents and visitors from across the island and even overseas, who visited the beach for picnics, recreational fishing, swimming and kolek (small wooden boat of regional origin) racing. Dance parties by the beach were said to have been organised for all to enjoy. Writing in The Straits Times in 1978, T. F. Hwang shares: â€œI remember the early 1950s where the annual Bedok-Siglap boat races were major pesta [â€œcarnivalâ€ in Malay] events, culminating at the end of the day in Bedok with community joget [a dance of Malaccan origin], dancing under coconut trees by the sandy beach.â€

In the 1960s, land scarcity prompted the government to embark on major land reclamation exercises. The extensive East Coast Reclamation Scheme, which commenced in 1966, was undertaken by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) as its largest venture at that time. Hills at Siglap, Bedok and Tampines were levelled using fully mechanised bucket wheel excavators and an automated conveyer belt transported the sand to the reclamation site. This project eventually added 1,525 hectares of land stretching from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu. It aimed to combine high density housing development with commercial and industrial interests in one area.

By the 1970s, kampongs began to make way for modern flats and industrial parks, and villagers were offered new flats in surrounding areas. At the time, Chai Chee was the only urban residential estate in the otherwise still rural, eastern region of Singapore. Mah Eng Siong, one of Chai Chee's first residents, recalls: â€œBy then, our family house (in the kampong) was very crowded. There were a lot of problems with so many people living so close together. It felt good to move to my own house.â€
By the early 1970s, flats like these were built in Chai Chee. Courtesy of Chai Chee Citizens' Consultative Committee.
Completed in the early 1980s, Bedok New Town was one of the new generation HDB towns that was planned as a total living environment. Residents, largely former farmers and fishermen, were also able to find new employment with big industrial companies like Matsushita, Hitachi and Fuji, whose factories were located in the area. Bedok's connectivity with the rest of Singapore increased with the completion of the 36-kilometre Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) in 1980 linking both ends of the island.
Bedok resident Keith Tan remembers moving into a high-rise at in Bedok South: â€œWhen we first moved, I was excited â€“ you get to see such a nice view over the east coast.â€ Resident Mahat Bin Ariffin, also appreciated the comforts of the new flats: â€œIt's a most convenient town, particularly for me because I work at the airport... You can really get a good night's sleep here. There are no mosquitoes!â€
While older residents recall the kampong days, the younger generation has fond memories of the stretch of East Coast created through land reclamation. Singapore Memory Project contributor Cassandra Lee recounts: â€œTo me, my neighbourhood constitutes of ECP (East Coast Park) because the route towards it holds a very special place in my heart. I will always remember my cycling trips with my dad... On those weekly Sunday trips, I would cycle behind my dad, taking in all the sights and sounds from our house to ECP. Sometimes, we would cycle as far as we could, until we were exhausted. It was fun and a great adventure for a kid.â€

Development of the area continues, with HDB's Remaking Our Heartlands (ROH) project that has once again transformed the Bedok town centre through an integrated complex, redeveloped hawker centre, sporting facilities, and a town plaza that includes a heritage corner supported by the National Heritage Board.

A child can never really run out of outdoor play options in sunny Singapore. Over a century, the island nation has gone from no designated play areas for children whatsoever to having one of the highest densities of playgrounds in the world.1

All work and no play makesâ€¦
Given the mercantile priorities of the colony, designing the city for children was low on the list for the British. So how and where did children play? In the congested city centre, they carved out their own nooks and play spaces in open drains and five-foot ways.2 In the outer belt,3 they ventured outdoors spinning tops, throwing marbles, fighting fish and flying kites.4
Over time, the colony's demographics evolved and its denizens made it clear that there was a need to better serve Singapore's younger populace. This desire was partly influenced by the international playground movement that started in 19th century America5 which posited that dedicated playsites could serve as gathering points for neighbours and build cohesive communities in crowded cities.6
Members of the Singapore public began writing to the press suggesting playgrounds be built and open fields set aside for general well-being. Businesses and businessmen such as Huat Hin Oil Company, the Singapore Traction Company, the Siong Lim Sawmill Company, Aw Boon Haw and David J. Elias responded by financing the first few playgrounds in Singapore. Import and export merchant Elias, for instance, donated swings, a see-saw and a slide to Katong Park.
The colonial government officially swung into action in 1951. It set up a Playing Fields Committee which found that just 250 acres or so of space had been set aside for the sports and recreation needs of its 700,000 occupants. It thus recommended the addition of more recreational spaces. In 1953, the British-run Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) added play equipment to Queenstown, Singapore's first satellite town. The playgrounds of 1950s and 1960s Singapore were basic and functional in nature, comprising simple slides, swings and see-saws.
Dragons, doves and pelicans â€” the iconic playgrounds of Singapore
When the Housing Development Board (HDB) took over from the SIT in 1960, it decided to design playgrounds that drew on local heritage and culture to help create stronger communal bonds.
The board's playgrounds typically comprised simple, geometric or animal-shaped concrete structures in sand pits.8 Its first playground designer, trained architect Khor Ean Ghee, was largely responsible for this. He designed more than 30 playground prototypes which HDB architects could take their pick from. Many of these models also featured terrazzo tile work as well as swings fashioned out of tyre and rope.
The dragon playground is the most famous of these early HDB playgrounds. Children can totter up the dragon's tail, walk along its long body and slide down its head.

Themed playgrounds of the 1980s
The next wave of playgrounds was designed by Chew Chek Peng. Her designs took on storytelling elements grounded in themes of identity and culture.
Take Tampines' fruit-based playgrounds. There, larger-than-life watermelon slices and mangosteens take centre stage, paying homage to the estate's fruit farm days.9 The colourful additions command attention, drawing children into a world where fruits are king.
No longer child's play
The 1990s gave rise to a new playground building industry as private companies rose to take on the responsibility previously held by the HDB. They had to meet national safety standards rolled out in 1999 by Spring Singapore, which spelled out specifications such as allowable materials. Playgrounds thus began looking modular.
These days, playgrounds are incorporated with fitness corners to encourage multigenerational bonding. On average, one playground serves about 600 to 800 flats.10
There are about 10 playground builders today. Apart from HDB playgrounds, they also develop play areas for malls, entertainment venues and parks, some of which cost several million dollars to build.11 Singapore has indeed come a long way from the $2,000 playgrounds of the 1920s.

A raging inferno at Bukit Ho Swee swallowed the homes of 16,000 kampung dwellers and took four lives on 25 May 1961.1 It was one of the biggest fires to ever tear through Singapore â€“ newspaper images depict plumes of black smoke blanketing the sky and obscuring the sun. In all, 40 hectares of densely-packed squatter land, the approximate size of 56 football fields, was scorched. The devastating fire cemented the necessity for safe, modern homes and marked a turning point in Singapore's public housing programme.
The Bukit Ho Swee fire displaced 16,000 kampung dwellers from their homes and killed four villagers in its wake. (Image from the National Archives of Singapore)
A razed village
Kampong Bukit Ho Swee was an unplanned township of 20,000 residents living in haphazardly-erected huts made primarily of materials such as wood and zinc. It experienced a population surge after World War II.2
On 25 May 1961, a small fire started innocuously enough in a makeshift squatter hut lying on its fringe â€“ a hillside at Kampong Tiong Bahru Road. However, powerful winds that day caused it to escalate into a roaring blaze, carving a sweeping path of destruction. Ferocious flames, furtherxf fuelled by oil and petrol from the area's godowns, leapt rather easily across the road to Kampong Bukit Ho Swee.3 The blaze ended up engulfing the kampong's warren of homes, searing through its flimsy roofs and walls.
Eyewitnesses' accounts as well as news reports document kampung residents scrambling for their lives with key belongings in hand and children in tow.
The low water pressure of nearby hydrants and the haphazard lay of Kampong Bukit Ho Swee impeded firefighters' valiant attempts to put out the blaze. (Image from the National Archives of Singapore
Since it was Hari Raya Haji, a public holiday, firefighters and police personnel had to be recalled from leave. They were pinged via repeated radio broadcasts. In all, 22 fire engines, 180 firemen, 20 police officers and nearly 1,000 army personnel were activated to battle the fire and help victims. Despite the strong show of force, luck was not on their side. Poorly pressured water hydrants, the kampung's irregular, twisting alleys, and chaotic crowds clogging up entry points, made it near impossible to put out the fire.
The conflagration was only stopped in its tracks by an open space along Ganges Avenue. This prevented the fire from swallowing up flats across the road.5 The last of the flames were extinguished later that night at Delta Circus.
Rendering aid in the aftermath
With the fire put to bed, the authorities could now assess the damage. The blaze, they found, had taken with it shops, factories and a school in an area spanning approximately 40 hectares. According to official tallies, four lives were lost that day, 85 villagers were injured, and 16,000 people had lost their homes.6 The cause of the fire could not be determined.
To cater to the displaced, schools along Kim Seng Road were converted into temporary shelters. Government agencies, the military and volunteer organisations also banded together to offer much-needed support by providing essentials such as mattresses, water, gas, and electrical supplies.7

Meanwhile, at Kampong Bukit Ho Swee itself, 1,500 policemen had been deployed to patrol its charred grounds and protect occupants' remnant belongings from looters.8 The authorities also worked to bury the carcasses of villagers' perished livestock. Estimates placed villagers' collective loss at approximately $2 million.9
Two days after the devastating incident, the Bukit Ho Swee Fire National Relief Fund Committee was set up by then Minister for Labour and Law K.M. Byrne. The committee eventually raised about $1.6 million to help victims get back on their feet.10
A safer way to live
Following emergency sessions with his cabinet as well as the Housing Development Board, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew assured victims a day after the blaze that they would be moved into new flats in areas such as Queenstown, Tiong Bahru, and even Bukit Ho Swee itself.11

Among other things, the government worked to acquire the affected Bukit Ho Swee site for low-cost housing. It also amended the Land Acquisition Ordinance to facilitate this.12 There were several phases to this operation and by 1970, Bukit Ho Swee had successfully transformed into a new residential area boasting 12,500 flats for more than 45,000 residents â€“ the majority of whom were residents of the former kampung settlement.13
The incident paved the way for newly-independent Singapore to kickstart a nationwide drive to relocate its kampung-dwelling population to safer, modern high-rise homes.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/edmund-william-barker/story,"Pioneer leader and top sportsman, Edmund William Barker (1 December 1920-12 April 2001) was a strong advocate for sports. Among other things, he worked to ensure the National Stadium, an important stage for local athletes and a defining landmark for Singapore's sports scene, was completed in time for the 1973 Southeast Asian Games.1
His other notable contributions include drafting the documents for Singapore's separation from Malaysia in 1965, and serving as the principal actor in the last round of talks with the Malaysians. 2

An all-rounder
Barker was charismatic and athletic, serving as head prefect and football team captain at Raffles Institution. There, he befriended individuals such as Lee Kuan Yew.
At Raffles College, he represented the school in a broad range of sports such as badminton, cricket, soccer, rugby and hockey, playing with future leaders of Malaysia like Tun Abdul Razak along the way.4
Barker later won the highly sought-after Queen's Scholarship which he used to pursue law at Cambridge University. He graduated in 1951.
Raffles Institution was established in 1823. It was originally sited at Bras Basah Road, where Raffles City Shopping Centre stands today. (c.1920)
Career & accomplishments
In 1963, Lee invited Barker, who had been practising law,5 to enter politics. He agreed out of a feeling of attachment and loyalty to Singapore.6 Barker won a seat in Tanglin during the general election the same year. He went on to serve unopposed in the constituency until his retirement from politics in 1988.7

Barker played an important role in Singapore's separation from Malaysia in 1965. Tasked to draw up the legal documents, he spent 10 days on the drafts. He also travelled to Kuala Lumpur with Minister of Finance Goh Keng Swee to finalise the deal with the Malaysians.8
Records credit Barker for his friendships with Deputy Prime Minister Tun Razak and Attorney-General Kadir Yusof as having helped mitigate some of the friction.9
Although Barker was the first on the Singapore side to sign the agreement just some time after midnight on 7 August 1965, he left space for his senior colleagues to add their names to the top of the treaty.10

While he never held a sports-related position in cabinet â€” having handled portfolios in Law, Home Affairs, National Development, Science and Technology, and Environment â€”11 Barker's contributions to Singapore sports were significant nonetheless. For instance, he persuaded the government to allocate land and money12 for the construction of the National Stadium,13 and as President of the Singapore National Olympic Council from 1970 to 1990, was part of the main organising committee which secured Singapore's role as host for two editions of the Southeast Asian Games.

Over the course of his 25-year career in politics, Barker was responsible for putting an end to the jury system; spearheading the Preservation of Monuments Act; and kickstarting the Golden Mile endeavour where a stretch running from Beach Road to Kallang was developed for city living.
Accolades Aplenty
For his contributions, Barker was noticed by global bodies such as the International Olympic Committee, which awarded him the Olympic Order (Silver) in 1985 for advancing Olympic values.14
In 1990, he was honoured by the Singapore government with the Order of Nila Utama (First Class).
Numerous sports-related scholarships and programmes at institutions such as Nanyang Technological University have been named after him. In 2011, his alma mater, Raffles Institution, set up the E. W. Barker Institute of Sports to support career athletes.15
E.W. Barker was very much instrumental in the construction of the National Stadium that would go on to not only host key sporting events like the 7th Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games in September 1973, but also the site of many memorable National Day Parades. (c. 1970s-1980s)

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/into-the-west-jurong-heritage-trail/story,"Text by Stefanie Tham
MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
A friendly debate comparing the western side of Singapore with the east went viral among netizens in early 2015, after a local Tumblr page was set up to poke fun at the west, which includes Jurong, Boon Lay, Pioneer, and Tuas. Commonly posted woes lamented the long time it takes to travel to and from the west, its lack of attractive amenities, and the dimal number of good food places found there.
Indeed, mention Jurong to most Singaporeans and most stereotypical descriptions tend to emerge, perhaps unjustly so. The west is often characterised by its industrial landscape, and thought to be barren, boring, and even bizarre. After all, those who do not live in Boon Lay may not regard smelling burnt cocoa at the MRT station as an ordinary, everyday experience.
However, Jurong is not as desolate as most people believe it to be. Empty grass fields in Jurong East have now given way to new shopping malls and beautiful landscaping, injecting life into the formerly quiet town. More changes can be expected as plans to develop the Jurong Lake District will commence in the years after 2015. Jurong is on the cusp of another stage of its transformation, perhaps one that will dispel old stereotypes.
A study of Jurong's past also reveals an intriguing and layered history, of a time when Jurong was home to a number of prawn ponds and well-known for its brickworks. Its successful transformation into a modern industrial estate also tells a tale of unwavering determination and foresight during the period when our nation was only just learning how to stand independently.
The Jurong Heritage Trail, which was launched in April 2015 by the National Heritage Board (NHB), highlights this rich heritage gathered through in-depth research and interviews with residents and workers who once called Jurong their home. The trail shares a colourful history that challenges the notion that the west is without character or heritage. Some sites of heritage still exist today and this article presents a number of locations featured in the trail that people can visit. No passport required.
Imagined Borders and Early Trades
The historical boundary of Jurong as seen on official maps does not quite correspond with the memories of its long-time residents. According to a 1911 map, Jurong was a small parcel of land sandwiched between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah, and was located where Bukit Batok is today. Today's Jurong East would have been a district called Pandan, whereas Boon Lay was formally called Peng Kang.

However, residents like Ng Lee Kar remembered a different Jurong, one whose boundary stretched from the 7 1â„2 Milestone at Bukit Timah Road to Tuas at the 18th Milestone. This was a large area that spanned the entire length of Jurong Road, once the only road leading to the southwest of Singapore. As many kampongs were only accessible through it, villagers identified their location by the road's milestones, and hence associated Jurong with the road.
Then, Jurong Road was not like the arterial roads Singaporeans are familiar with today. Consisting of only two lanes, a major accident would have rendered the road completely inaccessible. Former resident Francis Mane summed up this scenario as being â€œreally jialatâ€ (Hokkien term that connotes a difficult situation). His words could certainly be used to describe the day when Nanyang University opened in 1956 near the 14 1â„2 Milestone. Nanyang University, a national monument, is the first Chinese language university in Southeast Asia and was formed with the help of donations from the local Chinese community. A major traffic jam occurred along Jurong Road on the day of its opening, rendering the motorway impassable, and took the record for the biggest traffic jam Singapore experienced then.
Like many other parts of Singapore, Jurong was covered with plantations, mainly gambier and rubber. But it was the prawn ponds that still evoke fond memories among residents, some whom used to make a living from it. Jurong contained nearly half of the 1,000 acres of prawn ponds in Singapore in 1955. The area where Pandan Reservoir is today used to be covered with mangroves and was a prawn pond reserve. Chua Kim Shua remembered selling these prawns for 40 to 50 cents per kilogram at the market. â€œI was able to earn about a few hundred dollars a month just selling prawns,â€ he recalled. â€œWe scooped up the prawns using a pail, and there were many of them then.â€

Another notable trade in Jurong was its brickworks industry, a prelude to Jurong's industrialisation. Jurong was well-known for its brickworks since the 1920s, and once produced as many as three million bricks a month to meet demand in the construction sector in the 1970s. Also, the soil found in Jurong proved to be highly suitable for pottery making; Jurong had an abundance of the sticky mud known as nian tu, which was essential in pottery. This resulted in a burgeoning industry of brick and pottery making.
Today, people can still travel along a remaining stretch of the old Jurong Road entering from Bukit Batok Road or Jurong West Avenue 2. Although the Pandan Reservoir is no longer a prawn reserve, a slice of mangroves at the mouth of Sungei Pandan can still be seen. The reservoir is now an arena for water sports. A legacy of Jurong's former brickworks industry remains in the form of the Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln and the Guan Huat Dragon Kiln (today's Jalan Bahar Clay Studio), both located at Lorong Tawas where visitors can also pick up some ornamental pottery.
The Industrial Story
Most Singaporeans would not find the story of Jurong Industrial Estate unfamiliar. Often weaved into the Singapore Story as an example of how the country adapted to remain economically resilient, Jurong's industrialisation shaped the lives of many individuals who found work in its factories and a new home to live in.
The vast amount of land and its deep coastal harbour made Jurong the ideal location to become Singapore's primary industrial centre. The first bulldozer entered Jurong in September 1961, and its landscape has been altered permanently since. In spite of the government's high expectations, only around 24 factories were set up by 1963 â€” Singapore was far from solving her problems of growing unemployment and declining entrepot trade. It was only through supplying tax incentives, establishing good labour relations, and creating a sense of security for investors did factories finally sprout. By 1970, Jurong boasted 264 factories with 32,000 workers.
Formerly under the purview of the Economic Development Board (EDB), the management of Jurong Industrial Estate was handed over to a new statutory board, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), in 1968. A new headquarters was built for JTC: Jurong Town Hall. The five-storey building cuts an impressive presence, reflecting a Brutalist style of architecture that emphasises the imposing bulkiness of the concrete structure. The building's design was from a winning entry of an architectural design competition by a local firm, Architects Team 3, and it was most recently gazetted a national monument for its significance as a symbol of Singapore's economic progress.

The memories of those who worked in Jurong reveal the unique challenges of working in the estate in its early years. Distance was a big issue for those who did not live in Jurong, particularly because of limited public transport services in the area. Woo Lee Tuan remembered the difficulty of getting to work: â€œBack then, there [was] still no road leading to the estate, and we had to go via Pasir Panjang Road or Jalan Jurong Kechil.â€ This resulted in many workers sharing rides on pirate taxis, which Woo used to get to work. â€œThe vehicles were actually meant for transporting vegetables and other produce. It was quite an uncomfortable ride.â€
Others whose companies provided free transport regarded themselves lucky. As Haji Saleh bin Abdul Wahab recalled, â€œThe company provided private buses from the 7th Milestone. [They] provided transport for you even if you lived very far away like in Geylang.â€ Food centres were also scarce. Lim Sak Lan, who worked in JTC in the late 1960s shared: â€œWhen we were at worksites, we made do with site canteens. There were places away from the sites, but they were shabby little coffee shops and restaurants.â€
Despite such discomforts, many of them nevertheless took pride in their work and over time, formed close friendships with their colleagues. Karen Lee, who worked in a spinning mill, reminisced fondly: â€œWhen we worked the night shift we would go to the hawker centre to buy food we liked and bring it [back] to the factories for our working colleagues. When we stayed in the company hostel, we were very close... I can [still] remember these people now, even those who came from Malaysia.â€
In the present day, Jurong Town Hall still stands along Jurong Town Hall Road. In 2000, JTC moved across the road into a larger building, and the Town Hall is now a space for start-up companies. You can also take a stroll in the Garden of Fame next to the building, which commemorates the visits of many dignitaries to Jurong's Industrial Estate over the years.
Green Lungs
In the process of conceiving the industrial estate, urban planners wanted to ensure that green spaces were integrated to preserve the beauty of Jurong's natural landscape. Jurong was meant to be a self-contained garden industrial estate, and thus 12 percent of the land was set aside for public parks, gardens, and open spaces.
The Jurong Lake area is one such green lung planned to separate the industrial from the residential. The lake was formed after the Jurong River was dammed in 1971, creating the 81-hectare freshwater reservoir. Three islands were shaped, housing the Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, and the golf course of the Jurong Country Club. When it first opened, the Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden attracted immense attention, the former receiving half a million visitors within eight months of its opening in April 1975.

Jurong Hill is another point of attraction. Formerly called Bukit Peropok, the hill is the tallest peak in Jurong today. It was converted into a park in 1968, and a Lookout Tower was constructed at the top of the hill. Residents might remember dining at the Japanese teppanyaki restaurant when it opened in 1970, or spending a leisurely day with the family exploring the hill's Garden of Fame. The tower offers visitors a sweeping view of the industrial estate, and was a stop point for many visiting heads of states.

Today, the Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden are open for public visits. Jurong Hill is also accessible, although the restaurant has since closed.

Horses for Courses explored the history and development of horses, from the wild early years to the highly selective breeding of the present day. This exhibition celebrated the partnership between man and horse, in both work and play, within numerous cultures around the world.
Picture of the exhibition hall
A range of philatelic materials highlights the horse's role in agriculture, postal delivery, war, racing, and other areas. Horses have long been a reliable form of transportation and recreation for man. From myths and legends to art and hobby, Horses for Courses took visitors on a journey that revealed the strength, speed and loyalty of this noble creature.
Wall display at the exhibition
Way Back Then
The horse species Equus caballus, is from the Equidae family. It is a mammal that can be traced back some 50 million years.
The early ancestors were the size of small dogs and lived in Europe and North America. Over millions of years, the horse became taller with longer legs. It evolved to have one main toe (hoof); its neck lengthened with a light arch, and its teeth adapted to graze on grass, instead of chomping on leaves from plants.
During the Stone Age, horses were hunted for meat. In some parts of Europe, early depictions of horses were from cave paintings from this period. It's believed that wild horses roamed the plains of Asia and Europe about 30,000 years ago. But as the world changed, and as man began to encroach on their land, the number of wild horses started to dwindle. The only remaining wild horses today are the endangered Przewalski's horses, with only about 250 roaming wild in their native home in Mongolia.
Progress and Civilisation
About 4,500 years ago, man started to domesticate horses for transportation and to move heavy loads. Engravings, sculptures, and writings show that horses were used to draw chariots â€“ especially for burials â€“ in early civilisations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India.
The Egyptians were renowned for their skill in crafting swift chariots to carry archers for warfare, for example. The terracotta steeds buried alongside the soldiers in Xi'an, China, are also a testament to their importance in Chinese warfare.
The Umayyads, circa 650 AD, used well-trained Arabian horses for numerous successful raids and battles that created a vast empire stretching from the Middle East to France. And around the 13th century, Mongols led by Genghis Khan conquered a great expanse of land across continental Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe. The secret to the Mongols' success, it is said, was in using three to four horses in their battles and travels. As soon as one horse tired, another would take its place. In this manner, the Mongols' journeys and cavalry attacks were continuous.
Horses in the Americas disappeared with climatic changes but the Spaniards brought them back to North America during their conquests. Native Americans discovered the horses' usefulness and soon mastered the skill of horse riding for herding and warfare. Wild horses in North America are not considered truly wild; they are feral. A long time ago, these horses were domesticated by man but they were either returned to the wild, or escaped to wander free.
Riding into History
Ideas, language, culture, knowledge, and religion developed more efficiently in societies that harnessed horsepower. In Central Asia, for instance, horses enabled the transmission of discoveries such as paper, iron, printing and gunpowder across great distances.
In medieval times, armoured knights often formed the main thrust of attack but this eventually gave way to an artillery offensive. Seafaring European nations spread their influence and power across different continents - aided by horses for inland conquests.
Mail Delivery
Man relied on horsepower before the advent of motorised transportation. Letters and parcels were delivered by men on horses or in carriages. In the United States, the Pony Express (1860) was a relay system which spanned the distance from Missouri to California, over the Ro y Mountains. It took horseback riders about 10 days to cover a distance of over 3,000 km.
Stamps featuring mail delivery by horse
Accessories
Saddle
In early times, man rode on horses bareback, or with a piece of cloth or blanket. From around the 3rd century BC, leather saddles were introduced. With the use of stirrups, riders - especially warriors - were better able to keep their balance on a horse.
There are two main types of modern saddles. The Western has a high pommel in the front, which is useful for hanging a lariat â€“ a rope in the form of a lasso. At the back is a large cantle for better seat support. These features provide the rider with more comfort, especially when herding cattle. The English saddle is less padded and generally lighter.
Horseshoes
Horseshoes are usually U-shaped and they are nailed to the horse's hooves to protect them from the hard ground. Most horses are checked by a farrier or horse shoe fitter every six to eight weeks to tidy the hooves.
History & Culture
Horses often connote honour, intelligence, bravery, and many artists have depicted these qualities in art. Here are some philatelic examples showing man and horse through history, art and culture.
Austria: Lipizzaner
Stamp of Lipizzaner
The Lipizzan is closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna in Austria. The horses are trained in the school to perform the elegant movements and jumps of classical dressage, including what is also known as â€œhaute ecoleâ€, or â€œhigh schoolâ€ jumps. The â€˜dancing' Lipizzaner, a Spanish-Andalusian breed, can be traced back to the 7th century when Barb horses were brought into Spain by the Moors and crossed with native Spanish horses.
China: Qi Jiguang
Stamp of Qi Jiguang
Qi Jiguang was a Chinese military general and national hero during the Ming Dynasty of the 16th century. He was noted for his courage and leadership in the fight again Japanese pirates along the east coast of China, as well as his work on the Great Wall of China. Here, he is depicted riding his horse ready for battle.
China: Chinese Opera
Stamp of Chinese Opera
The use of symbolic representation is a primary feature in Chinese opera. In this picture, for example, the use of a fringed cane is to signify riding a horse.
Hungary: Arrival of the Hungarians
Stamp of Arrival of the Hungarians
The painting by ÃrpÃ¡d Feszty and other artists depicts the Arrival of the Hungarians (on horses) to the Carpathian Basin in 895. It was completed in 1894 to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the event. This cyclorama â€“ a panoramic painting framed in a cylindrical platform - measures 115 metres by 15 metres and is housed in the National Historical Memorial Park in Ã“pusztaszer, Hungary.
Jersey: The Black Horse of St. Ouen
Stamp of The Black Horse of St. Ouen
Long ago, Jersey was ruled by the French â€“ much to the unhappiness of the islanders. One such person was Philippe de Carteret, the Seigneur of St. Ouen and a member of the island's most influential family. To prevent any problems, the French soldiers decided to kidnap him. Philippe tried to escape on his black horse, and raced toward his manor across a deep wide ditch. His horse jumped and cleared it and returned Philippe to his home safely. But his faithful horse soon collapsed and died. To honour his horse, Philippe had the animal buried in his garden.
Kyrgyzstan: â€œKyz Koomayâ€
Stamp of Kyz Koomay
The stamp depicts a popular game in Kyrgyzstan, where a young man has to try and overtake a young woman â€“ while both of them are on horseback. The woman usually rides a faster horse and starts about ten seconds ahead of the man. If he catches her, he is rewarded with a kiss. If he does not, the woman can then whip him.
Mongolia: Morin Khuur
Stamp of Morin Khuur
The Morin Khuur is a horse head-shaped fiddle. It has two rings and is played with a bow usually rung with horsehair. Traditional folk songs are often accompanied by the wistful resonance of the instrument, which is said to mimic a horse's neigh or the wind whistling across the Mongolian plains.
Kyrgyzstan: â€œKok-Boruâ€ (Blue Wolf)
Stamp of ""Kok-Boru""
Mongolia: The Secret History of Mongols
Stamp of The Secret History of the Mongols
It is generally agreed that the Uyghur-scripted literature, â€œThe Secret History of the Mongolsâ€, was produced around the 13th century after Genghis Khan's death. Even though it is a compilation of folklore and myth, the 12 chapters serve as a significant reference to the history, culture, and genealogy of the Mongol Empire.
The people of Mongolia are fond of horse racing, wrestling and archery, often known as the â€œthree games of menâ€. Horses feature prominently in their lives. Horses and riders were decorated in colourful silks and ribbons during the races, which cover distances from 15 to 30 km.
Poland: Knight Tournament
Stamp of Knight Tournament
The first modern knight tournament was held in Poland in 1977. Participants dressed as knights arrived from all over Europe to compete in medieval games, as depicted in these stamps.
Singapore: Kuda Kepang
Stamp of Kuda Kepang
Kuda Kepang or Kuda Lumping is a type of dance that originated from Java, in which the dancer dons a colourful horse costume. The dance is said to be a re-enactment of battles again the Dutch, but these days it is performed more for entertainment or celebrations. Another version of this dance induces a trance on the dancer, who then mimics the behaviour of horses.
Portugal: Lusitano Horses
Stamp of Lusitano Horses
The Lusitano, named in 1966 after Portugal's ancient Roman name, is closely related to the Spanish-Andalusian horse. Lusitanos have competed in the Olympics and World Equestrian Games. In early times, they were deployed for war but these days they only participate in bloodless bullfighting.
Ukraine: Straw horse
Stamp of Straw Horse
Located in a region blessed with rich â€˜black soil', Ukraine has abundant wheat. After the grain is removed, the raw is used to feed animals, for housing, and to make traditional handicrafts.
United Kingdom: All the Queen's Horses
Stamp of All the Queen's Horses
To mark the British Horse Society's 50th anniversary, four stamps were issued that featured Queen Elizabeth II's ceremonial horses: two carriage horses from the Royal Mews, and two from the Household Cavalry.
United States: Cherokee Strip Land Run
Stamp of Cherokee Strip Land Run
The Cherokee Strip was an 8 million-acre piece of land in Northwest Oklahoma. In the late 1830s, the government moved the Cherokee tribe to eastern Oklahoma, and the natives were given a passage, known as the Cherokee Strip, to the western hunting ground.
In the early 1880s, many cattle ranches were established in the area. It was during this period that the term â€œcowboyâ€ was coined and that the expansion of the American West began. In 1893, by presidential order, the Cherokee Strip was opened for settlement. This resulted in the great land race, where more than 100,000 people rushed to lay claim on land.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
The museum scene in Singapore has flourished over the past few years and has reached a peak of over 50 museums in 2015, with a slew of diverse galleries and cultural institutions opening. As a physical space connecting the public with the arts, heritage, and culture, the museum remains a relevant and necessary institution in the cultural eco-system.
FaÃ§ade of the Indian Heritage Centre at 5 Campbell Lane.
Launched on May 7, 2015 and located in the heart of Little India, the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) showcases not only artefacts from the National Collection but also the community's collections. It also actively collaborates with the community for programming and outreach. Two hundred and three out of 443 artefacts on display at the museum are donated by or on loan from the community. These pieces in the permanent galleries offer a visual and chronological representation of the community's history, marking periods since the pre-modern era when South Asians established contact with Southeast Asians and East Asians.
The galleries focus on five major themes, starting from the early interactions between South and Southeast Asia, leading the visitor through the origins and migration of the South Asian community in Singapore, the pioneers and social and political awakening of the community in Singapore and Malaya and its pioneers, ending with contributions of Indians towards the making of Singapore as a nation.
The artefacts donated express this narrative in a variety of ways. One of the star artefacts highlighting the Indian migrants' rites of passage, attire, language, religious affiliations and festivals is the twentieth-century gold necklace (Kasumalai) which is a gift from the estate of Santhanam Victor Louis and the family of Gnanapragasam Pillai.
Gold Necklace or Kasumalai, 20th century. Gold. Gift from the estate of Santhanam Victor Louis and the family of Gnanapragasm Pillai.
The traditional necklace, made of gold and adorned with precious stones, was donated for alamkara, or ornamentation of deities, to the Sri Thandayuthapani temple built by the Chettiar community in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City. The Nattukottai Nagarattar Chettiars, who were among the early Indian migrants to the Southeast Asian region with business establishments in Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia and Singapore, commonly built temples in their places of settlement for the Hindu deity Murugan.
Another interesting artefact, on loan from P. G. P. Ramakrishnan, is the silver spade presented to P. Govindasamy Pillai by Holy Tree Balasubramaniar Temple, Naval Base, Sembawang on January 24, 1970. This artefact helps to present the visitors with further insight into the early Indians in Singapore and Malaya who lived during the pre-World War II era.
Silver Spade presented to P. Govindasamy Pillai by Holy Tree Bala Subramaniar Temple, January 24, 1970. Silver. On loan from P. G. P. Ramakrishnan.
One of these pioneers were P. Govindasamy Pillai, a native of Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu. Popularly known as PGP, he left home in his teens and boarded a ship to Singapore. After landing at Tanjong Pagar in 1905, he worked at a store which he later bought over, allowing him to establish a string of PGP stores along Serangoon Road. An ace money manager, he gradually saved enough to expand into other businesses including textile shops and flour and spice mills. He was also a noted philanthropist, a prominent donor to the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, a founder-member of the Indian Chamber of Commerce that was set up in 1937, and a Justice of the Peace from 1939.
The impact of nationalist and sub-ethnic nationalist movements on the Indian community in the region is shown through reformist activities and the revitalisation of the Tamil Language and identity by community leaders such as Thamizhavel G. Sarangapany. This is showcased by the selection of archival photographs, documents, and personal artefacts from the collection of Sarangapany's immediate family, donated by his daughter, Rajam Sarangapany.
Sarangapany, who arrived in Singapore in 1924, was an active writer and publisher. He set up the Tamil magazine Munnetram in 1929 and the Tamil Murasu newspaper in 1935. Through his writings, he promoted the principles of the Tamil reform movement. He encouraged Tamils to make Singapore their home, helped them gain citizenship, and championed for the Tamil language to be recognised as one of the national languages in Singapore.
Women also played a part as leading pioneers of the South Asian community in Singapore. This is characterised by a signature artefact gifted by Jamshed K. Fozdar and Parvati Fozdar: a commemorative plaque presented by the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) to Shirin Fozdar in 1988 in recognition of her contributions to Singapore as a staunch advocate of women's rights. Fozdar, who is of Indian origin, arrived in Singapore with her husband in 1950. By 1953, she had become instrumental in setting up Singapore's first girls' club at the Joo Chiat Welfare Centre to teach women English and arithmetic. She was elected honorary secretary of SCW in April 1952, and thereafter served a key role in the drafting and establishment of the Women's Charter in 1961. She also played an important part in the formation of the Muslim Syariah court in 1958. Her role in Singapore's women's movement represented a pioneering effort in establishing Southeast Asia's Baha'i community.

The diverse array of individuals, communities, religious and cultural organisations which comprised the South Asian community are represented by the textured narrative of the permanent galleries showcasing a primarily community collection. The IHC is evidence that the role of a heritage institution has evolved into a relevant social space of connectivity, culture, and heritage, supported by the people for the people.
According to IHC Director, Dr Gauri Krishnan, â€œIHC has been very fortunate in its artefact collection drive and has managed to source a significant number of artefacts through the community as well as the national collection within a very short span of time. Its collections are representative, cover diverse periods in history and communities and range from classical to modern â€” appealing to a wide cross-section of visitors. Even the evocative displays and media devices have made the artefacts more accessible and appealing.â€ IHC has harnessed media and technology to tell stories, making collections more accessible and providing the community's voice to the thematic curation. Other than three large interactives and over 20 touch screen interactives, IHC also offers visitors an immersive and novel experience with an Augmented Reality enabled audio guide. Commencing with an introductory film, which offers a curated perspective on the five themes in the permanent galleries, the interactive experience is geared towards engaging both group and individual visitors.

As one of the taller buildings in Singapore at the time, the red-bricked MacDonald House at 40A Orchard Road became the target of terrorists.1 at the height of Konfrontasi (confrontation).2 On 10 March 1965, two rogue Indonesian marines detonated an 11kg bomb at the building, killing three and injuring 33.3 It was one of 37 attacks.4 which unraveled during a period where Indonesia, led by President Sukarno, strongly opposed the formation of Malaysia.5
A post-war icon and a symbol of confidence in the future
Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, Singapore worked to rebuild and rise from the ashes. Completed in 1949, MacDonald House was a building which exemplified the nation's hope and confidence in the future.
Besides the northeast, the Japanese also swiftly repaired the bombed causeway to allow more troops to enter Singapore. (Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Standing at 10-storeys, it was one of the tallest buildings in Singapore at the time. It was also the first office building to be fully air-conditioned. It attracted prominent international banks as tenants.
The structure was designed by Reginald Eyre of Palmer and Turner, and named after Malcolm MacDonald, a well-loved British commissioner general for Southeast Asia from 1948 to 1955.
No ordinary Wednesday
10 March 1965 started as a run-off-the-mill work day for the 150 Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) employees based at MacDonald House. Like any other afternoon, staff had shut down the business at 3pm and were in the process of closing accounts.
Interior damage of the MacDonald House as a result of the use of nitroglycerin explosives.
Unfortunately, just seven minutes later, a deafening explosion ripped through the building. The inner walls of the mezzanine floor absorbed the blast's force as did the building's pillars. Windows within a 90m radius of the explosion shattered and cars parked outside the building also suffered damage. Dazed bank staff and passersby scrambled to safety. Several were not so lucky. Three people â€“ filing clerk Juliet Goh, 23; private secretary Suzie Choo, 36; and driver Yasin Kesit, 43 â€“ who had been sitting outside the building died that day. Another 33 were injured.
Survivors such as Reverend Kenny Yeo, who was 23 at the time of the incident, have been vocal in speaking out against acts of terror. Sharing about the horror he experienced, Yeo said he had been walking by when the bomb exploded. He recalled: â€œMy eyeball was blown out of its socket, and I had approximately 366 stitches.â€
An explosive confrontation
Investigations led rather quickly to the arrests of Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said â€“ Indonesian marine commandos in their 20s. Dressed as civilians, they had left nitroglycerin explosives near the lift lobby of the building's mezzanine floor.
The act of terrorism was roundly condemned by then Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye as a â€œsenseless act of crueltyâ€. The marines were subsequently hanged on 17 October 1968.
The MacDonald House bombing wasn't the only attack launched on Singapore. Between 1963 and 1966, more startling attacks protesting Singapore's merger with Malaya were sprung on the island.

No longer the victim
Today, following some rounds of renovation, there is little evidence of the tragedy that struck MacDonald House. It is occupied by tenants such as global advertising conglomerate McCann Worldgroup and beauty and wellness empire Expressions International, among other enterprises.
In 2003, MacDonald House was gazetted as a national monument. In 2015, five decades to the day of the bombing, a memorial was unveiled at Dhoby Ghaut Green which pays tribute to the victims of the tragedy and honours veteran soldiers and volunteers who defended Singapore during the tumultuous Konfrontasi era.
Today the MacDonald House remains as the last remaining brick structure in the Orchard Road area. It was gazetted as a National Monument in 2003 and is now home to its main tenants CitiBank and McCann Worldgroup.(c.2013. Image from lionraw.com)

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/shirin-fozdar/story,"Shirin Fozdar (b. 1905, Bombay, India â€“ d. 2 February 1992, Singapore) is a pioneer women's rights activist. She championed social issues for women in Singapore and was a key figure in the implementation of several laws and policies that benefited women in Singapore. Together with her husband, they were among the first to introduce the Baha'i Faith in Singapore.
Early Years
Shirin was born in India in 1905 to Persian parents of the Baha'i Faith. Even at a young age, she was an outspoken advocate, often speaking out on women's rights and social issues as a student in Bombay. At 16, Shirin was invited to speak on the topic of university education at the Town Hall of Karachi. The monumental event was hailed as â€œthe first time an Eastern woman had addressed a public gathering in the Eastâ€. She also spoke at the League of Nations in Geneva on the Equality of Nationality for Women. In 1950, Shirin left India for Singapore with her husband K M Fozdar.

Career & Accomplishments
The Fozdars settled down in Singapore in 1950 and were among the first to introduce the Baha'i Faith in Singapore. By 1952, there were enough Baha'is in Singapore to form the first Local Spiritual Assembly. Today, the Baha'i Faith is one of the ten major religions represented in the Inter-Religious Organisation of Singapore.

Shirin noted the lack of legal protection for women, particularly in the areas of marriage and dissolution. Polygamy was rampant and an accepted custom. These prompted Shirin to take up the women's cause and wage war against polygamy in Singapore. In 1951, she gathered with a group of women activists to discuss the formation of an umbrella organisation to provide a unifying voice for the various women's organisations already existing in Singapore. Following this meeting, the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) was formed in April 1952.
Shirin played a key role in the establishment of the Syariah Court in 1958. She corresponded with then Chief Minister David Marshall on the subject of easy divorces for Muslim marriages, which left many women stranded in dire straits. The Syariah Court was established in 1958 and the divorce procedures put in place led to a sharp decline in the divorce rate within the Muslim community.
As the honorary secretary of the SCW, Shirin also actively wrote to government officials, community leaders and the press to lobby for monogamous marriage law. Her persistence paid off when the People's Action Party (PAP) included women's rights in their election manifesto in 1959. After the PAP won the election, they passed the Women's Charter in the Legislative Assembly in 1961. The Women's Charter effectively outlawed polygamy for non-Muslims and provided fundamental rights for women.
Following Singapore's attainment of self-government in 1959, a Legislative Assembly Election was held in May. The People's Action Party, led by Lee Kuan Yew, won by a landslide to form the new government. The party had included women's rights in their manifesto in 1959. (Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Shirin focused on regional work after the passing of her husband. She spoke at international conferences on women's rights and set up schools in regions like Thailand to provide education for women.
Later Years
Shirin received an award from the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations in 1988 on International Women's Day for her invaluable contribution to the women's movement. She passed away on 2 February 1992. She was inducted to the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in 2014 for her contributions and efforts as Singapore's pioneer women's rights activist. She is also featured in the Indian Heritage Centre.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/david-marshall/story,"TL;DR
Singapore's first elected chief minister was none other than formidable criminal lawyer David Saul Marshall (12 March 1908 â€“ 12 December 1995) â€“ the founder of the Workers' Party. The eloquent, bushy-browed politician, who was often photographed with a pipe in hand, championed for independence from colonial rule1 and also laid the foundations for political initiatives such as meet-the-people sessions.2
A poster titled â€˜Speakers and Members of the First Legislative Assembly, Singapore'. David Marshall can be seen on top row, third from left. (c.1955)
From textiles to law
Born in Singapore to Saul Nassim Mashal,4 David Marshall, whose name was anglicised in 1920,5 was raised in a Jewish orthodox family alongside six younger siblings. School life for him started at a kindergarten run by the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus.6
As a student at Raffles Institution, Marshall became friends with individuals such as Benjamin Sheares and George Oehlers â€“ fellow future leaders of Singapore.
During the course of his education, Marshall attempted to apply for the highly sought-after Queen's Scholarship. However, being of weak constitution, he collapsed before he could take the exam. Marshall thus pivoted to the field of textile manufacturing which he pursued in Belgium.
Back home in Singapore, he worked as a textile representative and a French language teacher.7 Before he turned 30, Marshall decided to read law.8
A patriot at heart
When World War II came around, Marshall's family fled Singapore. He, however, chose to stay behind, going so far as to join the Singapore Volunteers Corps â€œBâ€ Company to defend the island. Unfortunately, he was captured in February 1942 and detained as a Prisoner-of-War (POW) for three years and six months.9
Even under the oppressive rule of his Japanese wardens, Marshall's outspoken personality and energy shone bright. A champion of justice, he frequently spoke up for the rights of his fellow prisoners. This drew the ire of his captors who tried to limit his influence.10 Over the course of his internment, Marshall was moved to multiple POW camps and even to a forced labour site in Hokkaido, Japan.11
Founded by Father Jean-Marie Beurel in 1854, the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) - otherwise known as Town Convent - was a Catholic girls' school that also took in boys, including Singapore's first Chief Minister David Marshall, for a period of time from the 1900s till the Japanese Occupation. (Early-mid 20th century)
This Prisoner-of-War (POW) camp in Innoshima, Hiroshima was probably one of the 26 POW camps that David Marshall was sent to during the Japanese occupation. (c.1940s)
Foray into politics
After the war, Marshall completed his law degree and worked at a number of law firms such as Aitken and Ong Siang, and Allen and Gledhill in Singapore.
In 1949, he joined the Singapore Progressive Party for about three years.12 Later, in March 1955, guided by his desire to boost the standing of the people of Singapore,13 Marshall decided to put his legal career on hold to focus more on politics. Among other things, he was determined to banish â€œracial superiorityâ€ and â€œbreak through sonic barriers against Asians and especially Jewsâ€.14
The same year, the Labour Front party led by Marshall was victorious in the Legislative Assembly election.15 It had secured 10 of the 17 seats it contested, and formed a coalition government with the Alliance Party. Marshall himself won a seat in Cairnhill and became Singapore's first elected chief minister.16 
The Labour Front contested in the 1955 Legislative Assembly Election and secured the most votes. As it did not win by a majority, it formed a coalition government with the Singapore Alliance Party and Marshall became Singapore's first Chief Minister (c.1957)
A brief tenure
As chief minister, Marshall tried to pursue self-governance and independence from the British. However, before he had the chance to warm his seat, the communists began giving him trouble. Civil unrest in the form of the Hock Lee Bus Riots,17 as well as the other unpredictable antics of Singapore's growing left-wing movement, kept him busy.
Although he was unsuccessful in attaining self-governance for Singapore, Marshall left a lasting legacy. While at the helm, a white paper on education policy was put forth advocating for more focus on the English language as well as multilingualism â€“ fundamental features of Singapore's education system today.18
Invested in fighting for workers' rights, Marshall was also instrumental in passing the Labour Ordinance to put an end to long work shifts. Additionally, he was involved in the introduction of schemes to help locals secure employment in the British-dominated civil service.19
Following unsuccessful talks with the British about self-governance for Singapore,20 Marshall resigned on 7 June 1956 after a brief 14-month tenure.
His political contributions, however, did not stop there. A year later, he founded the Workers' Party. Thereafter, he contested the Anson by-election, and on 15 July 1961 won a seat in parliament. In 1963, Marshall left the party21 and resumed his law career.22
Marshall was outspoken about his beliefs, and was against capital punishment as well as the abolition of the trial by jury system. His drive and passion led him to score acquittal after acquittal over the span of 41 years.
Upon the invitation of then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam, Marshall went on to serve as Singapore's first foreign ambassador to France, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland from 1978 to 1993.23

Legacy in criminal law
Stricken with lung cancer, Marshall passed away at the age of 87 on 12 December 1995. Numerous scholarships and fellowships, such as the David Marshall Professorship in Law and the Singapore Management University's David Marshall Prize, were established in honour of his exemplary legal career.24

Before taking office as Singapore's second president, Benjamin Sheares (12 August 1907â€“12 May 1981) spent three decades tirelessly improving Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) standards in Singapore, having been dismayed by high maternal mortality rates in the 1930s.
Overcoming colonial biases, he rose through the ranks of the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, fought for its post-war conversion into an O&G hospital, and was the first medical practitioner in Singapore to use the lower segment method for Caesarean sections.1 This and more helped shave the maternal mortality rate from 70 to 80 deaths per 10,000 deliveries in the 1930s to less than 10 by 1955.
Father of obstetrics and gynaecology
Benjamin Sheares aspired to be a doctor from a young age. As a child, his favourite game was playing doctor with his sister Alice.
There were few opportunities for Asians to become doctors in the British-run colony but Sheares worked to overcome these hurdles, including for instance, winning a scholarship to study medicine. By 1942, he had become head of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) department and medical superintendent of the local patient's section at Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH), overcoming the prejudices of his colonial superiors through hard work and genius.
Deeply concerned about high maternal mortality rates, Sheares was the first in Singapore to use the lower segment method of performing Caesarean sections. With this, as well as improvements in antenatal and postnatal outpatient care under his watch, maternal mortality rates fell to less than 10 deaths per 10,000 deliveries in 1955 compared to seven to eight times that in the 1930s.
It was also through Sheares that KKH was converted into an O&G Hospital after World War II.
The good doctor was reputed among his peers and patients for his golden fingers and superior surgical skills which led to minimal scarring. He was well-liked for his kind bedside manner and strong dedication to patient welfare. He checked in on patients regularly, even during the holidays, and was known for giving free treatment to the poor.
In 1950, he was appointed professor of O&G at the University of Malaya in Singapore.
Despite his busy schedule, Sheares authored papers on O&G and other topics such as infertility, cancer and surgical techniques. In all, 29 of his papers were published over the span of 24 years. Sheares also earned international acclaim for developing a technique to create an artificial vagina for individuals born without one. It eventually came to be known as the ""Sheares Procedure"".
In 1961, as his health began to trouble him, Sheares started his own private practice in Raffles Place.
Benjamin Sheares was one of several distinguished alumni who graduated from the King Edward VII College of Medicine. He was appointed acting professor of the college in 1945. (c.1950s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)

Family Man
Sheares married Yeo Seh Geok, a trained midwife in 1939. The couple had three children together.

While he spent long hours at work, he made up for it in the evenings when he would sometimes return with ice-cream for the family. On Sundays, Sheares brought his family out for a movie and a meal.
Singapore's second president
At the age of 63, just two years after opening his own clinic, Sheares was approached by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to become Singapore's second president. A generally private person, he took some time to consider this offer. His eventual acceptance of the post stemmed from his sense of duty to the nation.
Elected by parliament in December 1970, Sheares carried out the role with quiet dignity, continuing to live in his own home in Holt Road instead of the Istana. Because politics was out of his wheelhouse, he read extensively to keep abreast of current affairs, international politics and diplomacy.
During his decade as president, Sheares remained active in the medical field.

Ill-health plagued Sheared sporadically during his terms in office. In November 1980, a tumour was found in his lungs, and on 3 February 1981, he appeared unwell when he opened Parliament. Before he fell into a coma on 3 May 1981, Sheares had his affairs sorted. He died on 12 May 1981 with deep regret that he had been unable to see through his third term as president.

His wake at the Istana was thronged by 85,000 people â€” among them former patients touched by his dedication including a woman whose life and baby he had saved after an emergency operation at night.
A month later, Prime Minister Lee paid tribute to Sheares in a moving special address.2 Lee fondly recalled their regular monthly sessions where they would discuss work. Sheares, he said, had shared his cares of office.
These visits were ramped up towards the end with Lee visiting him once a week to comfort and console him. Lee said: ""During those harrowing weeks, at no time did I see fear or panic in his eyes or expression.""
With emotion in his voice, Lee added: â€œHe will always live in my memory. though when he died, a part of me also died. When a friend dies, the shared conversations, the shared experiences, the bonds of friendship can no longer be renewed. It is as if a thread has snapped. The thread is still there, but the person holding the other end has loosened his hold. The thread is slack.""

Dr Goh Keng Swee (6 October 1918â€“14 May 2010),1 one of the founding members of the People's Action Party (PAP),2 orchestrated much of modern Singapore's economic success. Among other notable accomplishments, Goh famously rescued the island from the brink of bankruptcy and was instrumental in shaping its industrialisation programme.3
Apart from serving the nation as its first Minister of Finance (1959-1965), Goh also took on the roles of Deputy Prime Minister (1973-1984), Minister of Defence (1965-1967; 1970-1979), and Minister of Education (1979-1980; 1981-1984). In addition, Goh chaired a number of government-led companies as well as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) from 1980 to 1985.4
A heart for the people
Goh was born in Malacca, Malaysia. He moved to Singapore with his family in 1920 at the age of two.5 He went on to study at Anglo-Chinese School and subsequently graduated from Raffles College in 1939. Armed with a diploma in the arts, Goh found a job as a civil servant in the British Administration.6 His work was disrupted by the invasion of the Japanese army and its subsequent three-year occupation.
After the war, Goh re-entered the civil service, working at the Social Welfare Department (SWD)7 as a social researcher.8 It was here that his passion for social justice and welfare was kindled. Goh also played a key role in putting together causes such as the People's Kitchens9 to alleviate post-war poverty among locals.10 His overall performance at work caught the eye of his superiors who gave him a scholarship to study statistics at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1948.11
Fighting injustice
In London, Goh started an anti-colonial group called the Malayan Forum.12 He was its first chairman.13 There, he met individuals such as Lee Kuan Yew and Toh Chin Chye who became his lifelong comrades. They gathered regularly to discuss the future of Malaya and Singapore.14 At LSE, Goh was awarded first-class honours in economics in 1951, and went on to obtain a doctor of philosophy degree.
Upon his return to Singapore, Goh was given the post of an assistant director at SWD. Shortly after, he became director. It was around this period that he felt perturbed by the pay disparity between non-British and British civil servants. Together with fellow civil servant and future PAP comrade K.M. Byrne, Goh formed the Council for Joint Action in 1952 to fight for equal pay.
Goh subsequently left the civil service to join politics full-time, contesting in the 1959 general elections as a member of the PAP â€“ the year Singapore secured self-governance. Goh won a seat at Kreta Ayer and became Singapore's first finance minister after the PAP's historic sweep at the polls.15

Turning a faltering economy around
Goh, as Singapore's newly-minted finance minister, inherited a government on the verge of financial collapse16 â€“ the nation was projected to suffer a deficit of $14 million by the end of 1959.17 Through expenditure cuts and other initiatives, Goh not only managed to save the country from going into the red but also succeeded in bringing in a tidy surplus of $1 million by the end of the year. His judicious style of fiscal prudence went on to have a lasting impact on the PAP government's approach towards the country's finances.
In 1961, Goh established the Economic Development Board (EDB).18 Along the way, he also launched an ambitious project in Jurong to transform swampland into an industrial estate.19 The unstable situation in Singapore at the time however, left many ill-convinced of its feasibility. Some even gave his Jurong Industrial Estate project the disheartening nickname â€œGoh's Follyâ€.20
Goh nonetheless preserved. Citing the initiative as â€œan act of faith in the people of Singaporeâ€,21 he put tremendous energy into the project and succeeded in proving critics wrong. By 1968, Jurong was home to 300 factories with 21,000 workers under their employ.22 Goh's strategy for success included having EDB conduct factory opening ceremonies daily over a three month period to drum up hype and awareness that the estate was now â€œopen for businessâ€.23
Along the way, Goh also established the Development Bank of Singapore (1968)24 and MAS (1971)25 to bolster Singapore's economic status in the region.

In 1962, Dr Goh Keng Swee, led a team to convert the swamplands of Jurong into a booming industrial estate that eventually took off to become a model benchmark of industralisation and innovation. (c.1967. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Establishing the Singapore Armed Forces
When Singapore became independent in 1965, Goh was appointed Minister of Defence and was tasked to build up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch.26 To achieve this, Goh introduced the 1967 NS (Amendment) Bill which essentially made conscription compulsory for Singaporean males27, thus greatly accelerating the formation of the SAF.28

In 1965, Goh was appointed the Minister of Defence and was handed the daunting task of building up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch. This would lead to the introduction of the 1967 NS (Amendment) Bill that made National Service (NS) compulsory for all 18-year-old male Singapore citizens and permanent residents (c.1966.

Here he stands beside Lim Kim San (Chairman of Port of Singapore Authority) and Jek Yeun Thong (Member of Parliament â€“ Queenstown) at a reception after the swearing-in ceremony of cabinet ministers in the Istana. (c.1985. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Other contributions
As the Education Minister, Goh was asked to identify and address issues with Singapore's education system. His findings and suggestions were put together in a report which subsequently led to major reforms and an overhaul.29 Among the changes â€“ the introduction of a streaming system so primary and secondary school students could learn at their own pace.30 This, he felt, could help address the issue of high dropout rates.31
While at the helm at MAS, Goh focused on promoting Singapore as an international financial centre. He made major amendments to the Banking Act, the MAS Act and the Finance Companies Act.32
Goh's contributions went beyond policymaking. Among other things, he pushed for the establishment of Sentosa (1968), the Jurong Bird Park (1971), the Singapore Zoological Gardens (1973) and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (1986).33
Built in 1971 and 1973 respectively, the idea of the beloved Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoological Gardens were also initiatives spearheaded by Dr Goh Keng Swee. (c.1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
The idea behind turning the former military base on Pulau Blakang Mati into the tourist and leisure destination we know today as Sentosa was conceived by Dr Goh Keng Swee back in 1968. (c. Mid 1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
A lasting legacy
Goh stepped down from politics in 1984. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the nation, he was awarded the prestigious Order of Temasek (First Class) the following year.
Numerous scholarships and foundations were also set up in his name. Among them, the Goh Keng Swee Professorship and the Master's Scholarship in Economics. In 2008, Goh's wife Phua Swee Liang set up the Goh Keng Swee Foundation to help the disadvantaged.34
Goh passed away on 14 May 2010 but the fruits of his labour are still evident today.35

The Formative Years (1923 â€“1950)
Lee Kuan Yew was born on 16 September 1923 in Singapore. He was the top student from Raffles Institution in the Senior Cambridge examinations of 1940. He then entered Raffles College with the hopes of going on to study law in London, but his plans were interrupted by World War II.
After the British surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, Mr Lee narrowly escaped being killed in sook ching (â€œpurge by cleansingâ€) â€” the Japanese army's anti-Chinese operation which took the lives of many Chinese. He had gone to the Jalan Besar sook ching screening, but sensing something was wrong, he excused himself from the line-up. He hid with his gardener's help and fortuitously cleared the screening the next day. He later recalled that he did not choose to enter politics; it was the Japanese occupation that brought politics to him. The brutal occupation forced him to realise that unless Singaporeans took their fate into their own hands, they would forever be at the mercy of major powers.

University of Cambridge and the Malayan Forum
Lee Kuan Yew resumed his studies after World War II. He first enrolled at the London School of Economics, and then moved to the University of Cambridge in 1947. He graduated from Cambridge with â€œDouble Firstâ€ honours in Law and received the only star for distinction in his year.

While in England, Mr Lee joined the Malayan Forum together with Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye, who would later form the PAP with him. The Forum was a group of politically conscious Malayan students in Britain who were working towards an independent Malaya, which would include Singapore. Mr Lee returned home after being called to the Bar in June 1950.
""The time has come for Malayans to unite, for we can't stop this exploitation unless we are masters in our own country. So that is the first thing that has to be put right. We've got to have independence.""
â€“ Lee Kuan Yew, at an election rally, 21 March 1955
Road to Merdeka (1950 â€“1965)
Legal adviser to trade unions
In 1952, Lee Kuan Yew represented the Postal and Telecommunications Uniformed Staff Union in its salary negotiations with the colonial government. He exposed the high-handedness with which the postal workers had been treated, but advised them to adopt a peaceful, moderate approach in the negotiations. Mr Lee gained wide publicity after he succeeded in negotiating a better deal for the postal workers. Soon, more trade unions and clan associations began approaching him to be their advocate.
At the Singaporean Union of Postal and Telecommunication Workers' premises for the PAP's Special Party Conference, 3 February 1955. It was decided at the meeting at the PAP would contest the upcoming Legislative Assembly Election. Four candidates, including Lee Kuan Yew, were fielded.
Formation of the People's Action Party (PAP)
Together with a small group of students who had recently returned from England, Lee Kuan Yew developed the idea of forming a political party to fight for independence through constitutional means. This group â€” Toh Chin Chye, Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam and Kenneth Byrne, joined later by Samad Ismail and Devan Nair â€” met regularly in the basement dining room of Mr Lee's home in Oxley Road.
The Fajar trial
In 1954, Lee Kuan Yew was approached to defend eight University of Malaya students who had been charged with sedition for publishing an article in Fajar, an undergraduate magazine. Together with Queen's Counsel D. N. Pritt, Mr Lee defended the students successfully. Soon after, he represented Chinese middle-school students who were appealing their conviction for rioting over National Service registration. This was Mr Lee's introduction to the Chinese educated world. As he described it, it was â€œa world teeming with vitality, dynamism and revolutionâ€.
Greeting Queen's Counsel D. N. Pritt at the airport, 1954. Pritt had own in to represent eight University of Malaya students charged with sedition for an article published in Fajar, an undergraduate publication. All eight were acquitted.
Inauguration of the PAP
Through these students, Lee Kuan Yew became acquainted with Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan, two influential figures in the Communist United Front. Mr Lee told them of his plans to form a political party, and they soon joined the Oxley Road group. On 21 November 1954 the PAP was inaugurated at the Victoria Memorial Hall.
The 1955 Legislative Assembly Election
The PAP put up four candidates, including Lee Kuan Yew. The PAP won three seats, with Mr Lee himself winning the largest number of votes cast for any candidate. He had emerged as the natural leader of the anti-colonial movement.

""Once in a long while in the history of a people, there comes a moment of great change. Tonight is such a moment in our lives... We begin a new chapter in the history of Singapore. The powers of the people through their elected government are limited to our internal affairs. It is not what we really want. It is but a step forward towards merger and Merdeka.""
â€“ Lee Kuan Yew, at a mass rally following the PAP's victory in the 1959 Singapore General Election, 3 June 1959
Open front alliance
Lee Kuan Yew and his non-communist colleagues in the PAP felt they had to forge an alliance with the communists to fight colonialism. But this meant a constant tussle for control within the PAP. Mr Lee secretly met Fong Chong Pik, a representative of the Malayan Communist Party whom he named â€œthe Plenâ€, short for Plenipotentiary, in his Battle for Merger talks.
Shouting ""Merdeka!"" (Independence in Malay) at a rally at the Padang, 15 April 1957. Lee Kuan Yew had returned from London. He had been a member of the all-party delegation attending constitutional talks on self-government for Singapore.
The 1959 General Election
The PAP took 43 out of 51 seats in Singapore's first general election for a fully-elected legislature. It was a landslide win. Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of self-governing Singapore. He began immediately implementing the far-reaching social and economic policies that transformed the island over the next few decades.

Independence through merger
In May 1961, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, announced the possibility of a merger with Singapore. Disagreement over this issue prompted a split in the PAP in July 1961. The pro-communists led by Lim Chin Siong first tried to bring down the government in the Legislative Assembly. When they failed, they broke away to form the Barisan Sosialis. The trade unions also split â€” those loyal to the PAP formed the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), while the pro-communist unions set up the Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU).
This resulted in a fierce battle for the hearts and minds of Singaporeans. Lee Kuan Yew made a series of radio broadcasts to expose the communists â€” their aims, methods and organisation â€” and visited all 51 constituencies. A referendum was held in September 1962 in which the PAP's proposal for merger with the Federation won 71 percent of the votes. A year later, on 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of Malaysia. Five days after Merger, the PAP won 37 seats in the 1963 General Elections, compared to the Barisan Socialis' 13. The PAP â€” with Mr Lee's â€œsuperb political generalship,â€ as Dr Goh Keng Swee later described it â€” had survived the communist onslaught.

Merger, however, turned out to be an unhappy experience. The PAP contested the 1964 Malaysian General Election, but won only one seat in the peninsula.

On 9 August 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia. The image of Mr Lee on television crying over this â€œmoment of anguishâ€ was something no Singaporean would forget.
""I have a responsibility for the survival of the two million people in Singapore... my overriding, my paramount duty is the survival of my own people... I am determined that they will survive and I think they've got enough grit in them.""
â€“ Lee Kuan Yew, interview with foreign correspondents, 14 August 1965
Survival and Nationhood (1965 â€“1990)
This period has been closely identified with Lee Kuan Yew's leadership and strength of character. Assisted by a group of exceptionally able colleagues, he transformed Singapore into a progressive, open and economically successful nation.
Obtaining international recognition for Singapore
Lee Kuan Yew believed that it was most important to position Singapore in the international system. Before Singapore's independence, he had already been meeting key figures of that time (including Nehru, Nasser and Tito) and leading missions to Africa and Australia on behalf of Malaysia. He put this experience to good use as soon as Singapore became independent.
Rule of law and non-corruptibility
Lee Kuan Yew initiated constitutional changes and adapted the rule of law to the local context. He insisted on high standards of probity in government and was relentless in fighting corruption. He believed the success of the country depended on the strength and integrity of its institutions, particularly the civil service and the judiciary.

Lee Kuan Yew envisioned a meritocratic, multiracial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society, where no one would be favoured or discriminated against because of their race, language or religion. He shunned race-based political parties and stressed the importance of racial and religious harmony. In education, he instituted bilingualism with English as the medium of instruction and with Mandarin, Malay and Tamil as the mother tongues. There shall be no majorities or minorities in Singapore, he declared soon after Separation. He combated chauvinism in all its forms.
Building a defence force
To ensure Singapore's security, Lee Kuan Yew worked closely with Defence Minister Goh Keng Swee to build up the Singapore Armed Forces. In 1967, he introduced compulsory National Service for all 18-year-old male citizens. 900 full-time National Servicemen were enlisted in the first batch that year.
Surviving without the British military
In the 1960s, the British military bases contributed about 20 percent to Singapore's Gross Domestic Product. After the British announced in 1968 they were withdrawing their forces â€œEast of Suezâ€, Lee Kuan Yew negotiated with British leaders a generous aid package and a postponement of the date British forces would leave Singapore, from March to December 1971. He also set up the Bases Economic Conversion Department, led by Hon Sui Sen, to oversee the conversion of British military bases and facilities into commercial use. In this way, by boldly turning crisis into opportunity, Singapore survived the British withdrawal. That was to become a hallmark of Mr Lee's leadership as Singapore tackled the crises of the 1970s and 1980s.
""We cannot go backwards in time, to the old trading port of Singapore. We have to move forward and upwards, diversify our economy, upgrade technology in factories and offices, and increase our knowledge and skills.""
â€“ Lee Kuan Yew, National Day Message, 8 August 1982
Establishing Singapore's economic base
Unique among leaders of developing nations of his time, Lee Kuan Yew welcomed multi-national companies. He saw them as a means of industrialisation and to link up Singapore to the world. Central to his economic vision was the establishment of industrial harmony. Mr Lee worked closely with Devan Nair and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to promote tripartism. The National Wages Council was set up in 1972 with representatives from unions, management and government to achieve a consensus on wage issues.
Creating a financial centre
Together with Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lee Kuan Yew helped make Singapore a global financial centre. In 1967, the Board of Commissioners of Currency was established to issue the Singapore currency. In 1971, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country's de facto central bank, was established. And in 1981, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) was formed to invest government reserves. Mr Lee served as GIC chairman from its founding till 2011.
A stake for each citizen
Giving every citizen a stake in the country was of primary importance to Lee Kuan Yew. His vision was a nation where every citizen owned a home. So he set up the Housing and Development Board to build and sell flats to Singaporeans. As wages rose, Mr Lee also raised the Central Provident Fund contribution rates to help Singaporeans buy homes and ensure they have adequate retirement savings. In 1984, he initiated Medisave, a national medical savings scheme. These schemes and institutions â€” HDB, CPF, Medisave â€” remain the bedrock of Singapore's social policy today.

Organising the grassroots
To nurture confidence and trust between the people and the government, Lee Kuan Yew set up the People's Association and became its first chairman. Community Centres were built all over the island to bring people together. In addition, Mr Lee launched many campaigns â€” from â€œKeep Singapore Clean and Greenâ€ to â€œSpeak More Mandarin, Less Dialectâ€. He and his old Guard colleagues considered themselves to be public educators as much as political leaders.
""People must feel that Singapore is worth being part of and worth defending. Otherwise, we cease to exist... We can make Singapore a vibrant and thriving society, with opportunities for a rewarding and fulfilling life. ""
â€“Lee Kuan Yew, National Day Message, 8 August 1989
Establishing international relations
Lee Kuan Yew helped Singapore establish strong relations with major powers like the United States, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom. He welcomed the United States as a stabilising force in the Asia-Pacific region. His rapport with Deng Xiaoping led to the strengthening of ties with China from the 1980s. Mr Lee was well received by the top world leaders of his time.

The Commonwealth and ASEAN
Lee Kuan Yew ensured Singapore's voice was heard on the world stage. Singapore hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1971, with Mr Lee as the chairman. Together with his Foreign Minister S Rajaratnam, Mr Lee was a strong supporter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which he viewed as important to regional stability.
Placing Singapore on the world map
Mr Lee took a personal interest in Singapore Airlines (SIA), and urged it to focus on international rather than regional routes. His decision to build Changi International Airport, which opened in 1981, helped Singapore become the air hub of the region.
A clean and green Singapore
Mr Lee believed in a clean and green environment. He was the inspiration and chief architect of Singapore's transformation into a â€œgarden cityâ€, and later into a â€œcity in a gardenâ€. The clean-up of the Singapore River and the Kallang River basin â€” a massive project that took 10 years to complete â€” together with the waterways, parks and trees that dot Singapore's landscape are among the most enduring of Mr Lee's achievements.
Inspecting the Singapore River, 2 September 1987. Lee Kuan Yew considered the decade-long project to clean up the river one of his most ambitious undertakings.
The water story
Singapore's dependence on Malaysia for its water was a matter of profound importance. Lee Kuan Yew was the key figure in all bilateral talks with Malaysia over water. Thanks to his leadership, Singapore focused on developing its own water resources. This included converting more than three- quarters of the island into water catchment areas, developing desalination plants and introducing NEWater or reclaimed water.
Leadership succession
Lee Kuan Yew believed that the continued success of Singapore depended on having capable people in government, especially its political leadership. After the 1988 General Elections, he paved the way for Goh Chok Tong to succeed him as Prime Minister. He saw this as his final duty as Prime Minister before stepping down in 1990.
""... my values are for a government which is honest, effective and efficient in protecting its people and allowing opportunities for all to advance themselves in a stable and orderly society, where they can live a good life and raise their children to do better than themselves...""
â€“Lee Kuan Yew, keynote speech at the Create 21 Asahi Forum in Tokyo, 20 November 1992
His Legacy

Mr Lee had an active post-Prime Ministerial career, and his presence was felt both at home and abroad. One of the highlights of these years was the publication of his two-volume memoirs. It was translated into many languages, including Spanish, Portuguese and French, reflecting the worldwide interest in the views of Asia's pre-eminent elder statesman.
Speaking at the launch of the second volume of his memoirs, From Third World to First, 16 September 2000.
Legacy
Lee Kuan Yew's legacy is Singapore. He devoted every fibre of his being, the full measure of his considerable talents and energy, to the betterment of his fellow citizens. He believed in a fair and just society, one in which every citizen had a stake. He believed we could be â€œone united people, regardless of race, language or religionâ€. He believed government had to be honest and strong if it was to be a force for good. He thus insisted on the rule of law, meritocracy and zero tolerance of corruption. It is upon these solid foundations laid by Lee Kuan Yew and his generation of leaders that Singapore will continue to thrive in the decades to come.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010
The passing of Dr Goh Keng Swee (1918â€“2010), who laid the foundation stones of Singapore's economy and defence forces, has left the nation without one of its most well-respected citizens.
The National Archives of Singapore (NAS) wishes to remember and honour Dr Goh for his instrumental role in establishing the Oral History Centre within NAS in 1979. In the words of Mr Kwa Chong Guan, Chairman of the NAS Board:
""We salute and remember Dr Goh for his foresight in establishing an Oral History Centre within the National Archives of Singapore. With his support and guidance the establishment has grown to become the premier Oral History Centre in the region. We are delighted to have had the honour of interviewing Dr Goh in 1980 and look forward to releasing the interview for public consultation, in honour of Dr Goh, and to help a new generation of Singaporeans understand Dr Goh better. (May 2010)""
Apart from his oral history interview, Dr Goh's memory has been preserved in a rich collection of oral history interviews, speeches, photographs and video recordings possessed by the National Archives of Singapore (NAS). NAS holds over 4,000 photographs of Dr Goh, 700 video clips and some 350 transcripts of public speeches of Dr Goh. These materials are available to the general public for viewing.
Dr Goh was among the most important members of Singapore's founding generation of leaders. He played a critical role as Minister of Finance in the crucial early years from 1959-65 and from 1967-70 laying the groundwork for Singapore's subsequent economic development. Though on hindsight Singapore's economy could appear to follow a clear progressive path, at that time, the task to build an economy was fraught with grave uncertainty, as Dr Goh said in this 1969 speech:
""When my [PAP] government first assumed office on June 3rd 1959..... businessmen and industrialists, far from hailing this event as a happy augury for the future, felt for the most part that the end of the world was around the corner. The stock market collapsed and there was a flight of capital out of Singapore. Several people fled the country. [But] In a short space of ten years, we brought about a transformation of the business climate.""1

Among Dr Goh's many achievements in helping to bring about this transformation was his role in establishing the Economic Development Board (EDB) in 1961, the Jurong Industrial Estate in 1962 (which he promoted in spite of severe public criticism, though it turned out to be the right move) and the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) in 1968. These institutions have made, and continue to make, vital contributions to Singapore's economic success.

The unpromising ground and distance of Jurong from Singapore's town and port led the project's detractors to term it ""Goh's Folly"". However, the Jurong Industrial Estate turned out to be a great success. By 1976, 650 factories were in operation in Jurong, which became central to independent Singapore's industrialization.

Dr Goh was also responsible for developing the economic strategy that is crucial to explaining Singapore's economic takeoff. Between 1959 and 1965, he advocated an import-substitution strategy and positioned Singapore as a manufacturing centre supplying the common Malaysian market. Following Singapore's independence in 1965, Dr Goh realised the futility of keeping to this plan and began promoting an export-oriented developmental strategy. By adopting this export-oriented strategy, he went against influential economic theories circulating in the 1960s and 1970s which asserted that state protectionism and heavy government expenditure was necessary to spur growth in emerging economies.
Dr Goh formulated policies which resulted in Singapore adopting an open economy that encouraged free trade, competition and foreign direct investment by multi-national corporations, while encouraging economic thrift and prudence by the Singapore government and people.2

Dr Goh was also convinced that successful economic development depended on the determination, initiative, enterprise and self-reliance of a people and that good government should encourage these qualities. He outlined these convictions in a speech to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in 1969:
""We in Singapore believe in hard work. We believe that enterprise should be rewarded and not penalised. We believe that we must adjust ourselves to changing situations. We believe in seizing economic opportunities and not let them go past us. Finally, we believe in self-reliance.....These are human qualities that have helped to transform an island-swamp into a thriving metropolis. They are the traditional virtues of Singaporeans and so long as we retain these virtues, we can face the future with confidence.""2
Dr Goh's convictions were proved correct and his thought remains a cornerstone of Singapore's economic policy.
Following Singapore's separation from Malaysia in August 1965, Dr Goh handed the Ministry of Finance over to his successor Mr Lim Kim San and took up the position of Minister of Defence. As Minister of Defence, Dr Goh was tasked to secure Singapore's national borders from both internal and external threats. A government gazette released in October 1965 stated that his field of responsibility included â€œSecurity, Law and Order, Defence, National Service...People's Association, Vigilante Corpsâ€.4

Dr Goh's most immediate and important task as Defence Minister was to build a credible Singapore armed forces, literally from scratch, in double quick time. Dr Goh was convinced that a strong Singapore army was necessary to secure the country's independence:
""British military protection today has made quite a number of our citizens complacent about the need to conduct our own defence preparations. These people assume that this protection will be permanent. I regard it as the height of folly to plan our future on this assumption and, indeed, the only rational basis on which we, as an independent country, can plan its future is on the opposite assumption....Nobody, neither we nor the British can say when this will be....[but] whatever the time may be, it would be useless then to think about building up our defence forces.""5
Dr Goh succeeded in this daunting challenge, and in the process laid the foundations of one of the most important and successful Singapore state institutions in a mere six years. Many ideas and institutions on which the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is built were put in place during Dr Goh's tenure, for instance a conscript army and compulsory national service for young men.6 He believed that Singapore citizens should participate directly as soldiers in their country's defence to reinforce their sense of responsibility to the national community and to strengthen their bonds with one another as countrymen. Dr Goh thought that this was especially important as Singapore as a new nation populated by migrants of diverse origins and particularistic interests did not possess a strong national consciousness:
""Throughout man's long history, defence of the community has always been regarded as a noble duty. In the process of integrating loose collections of people into a nation with a strong sense of identity, military service has played a significant role. From the Greek City States of the fifth century B.C. to the twentieth century continental super powers, we have seen how the development of the national consciousness has been so often centred around service in the defence force... In Singapore, we are not yet a close knit community, so many of our people are of recent migrant origin. All this goes towards creating a sense of values which is personal, self-centred with anti-social tendencies where a conflict arises between personal interests and social obligations. These are the values of a rootless parvenu society. We cannot hope to remove them overnight, but in the process of creating a stronger national consciousness among our people, we will find that military service will play an important role..""7
When Dr Goh gave up his defence portfolio in 1979 he left Singapore with we a well-rounded citizen army containing commando units, armoured battalions and an air force8  â€“ the core of a modern army â€“ when previously Singapore had nothing.
Besides defence and economic matters, Dr Goh also made significant contributions to Singapore in the field of education. Between 1979 and 1985 he was put in charge of the Ministry of Education where he introduced important reforms. The influential Goh Report, released in 1979 under Dr Goh's supervision, examined the challenges facing the education system and detailed recommendations that would profoundly influence its future direction. Notably, the current practice of â€˜streaming' in schools was introduced through the report, with the purpose of helping all students develop their potential more fully, in particular the weaker students.9 As Dr Goh explained:
""Our system of education, lasting twelve years, has been tailored to suit the brightest 12% of students. The inevitable result is high wastage rates in our schools, both primary and secondary. Automatic promotion was practiced in primary and secondary schools up to 1975 and 1977 respectively. This means that as the slow learners moved from lower to higher classes, they understood less and less of what was being taught. Automatic promotion for Primary and Secondary schools was abolished in 1976 and 1978 respectively and retentions enforced on a large scale. This did not produce the results hoped for. Retention inflicts a psychological trauma on the child and when this is repeated two or three times, it would be an exceptional child who does not lose interest in learning, suffer a loss of self-esteem and self-confidence and develop character defects as a consequence of these. ...We must accept the principle of teaching children of different leaning capacities at different rates. The Report recommends different streams of education to suit the slow, average, above average and outstanding learners.""10
Dr Goh was appointed Deputy Prime Minister between 1973 and 1979, and from 1980 to 1985 he was made First Deputy Prime Minister, the position from which he retired from public life in 1985.

Between 1980 and 1985, he was made Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), where he spearheaded major organisational and professional improvements. He also came up with the idea in 1981 that Singapore's national reserves should be managed by a specialised and professional investment management body that led to the formation of Singapore's Government Investment Corporation (GIC) in which he served as Deputy Chairman between 1981 and 1994.11

Apart from these achievements, Dr Goh was responsible for initiating or founding a diverse mix of other Singapore institutions, reflecting his remarkably broad range of interests. He championed the establishment of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (setup in 1968), the Jurong Bird Park and the Singapore Zoological Gardens (opened in 1971 and 1973 respectively), and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (setup in 1978). He conceived the idea of transforming the island of Pulau Blakang Mati, which was renamed â€˜Sentosa' in 1968, from a military base into a tourist and leisure resort â€“ an idea which has come to full cycle with the opening of the Sentosa Integrated Resorts in 2010. He also laid the groundwork for the creation of the Singapore Totalisator Board which was established in 1988.12 Following his retirement, the government of the People's Republic of China sought out Dr Goh's expertise and appointed him as its economic adviser on coastal development and tourism in 1985. Dr Goh was the first foreigner to be appointed to such a role â€“ a testament to the international recognition he had garnered for his accomplishments.
Dr Goh was not only an exceptional Minister. He was a humble and humane person, compassionate for the needs of the less fortunate and deeply interested in social issues. He had in fact started his career as a social researcher at the Social Welfare Department (SWD), which he had chosen to join at the end of the Japanese Occupation in 1945, although the SWD was then a small organisation with little prestige in the civil service. As a young officer in the SWD he played a central role in organising the People's Kitchens during the British Military Administration (1945- 46). The People's Kitchens provided very low-cost but nutritious meals which ensured that fewer people went hungry during those difficult years.
Though a relatively junior officer at the time, his keenly analytical mind and wry wit were already evident. This is a passage taken from the preface of a Report on Urban Incomes and Housing which Dr Goh prepared in 1956 when he was Assistant Director of Social Welfare (Social Research) at the SWD:
""I should like to make clear at the beginning the essentially limited scope of the work. Those looking for a penetrating analysis of Singapore's social problems, covering all aspects in one broad and majestic sweep will look here in vain. This study does not go further than describing some of the things which a team of investigators discovered and reported in the course of five months of field work. Further, it is in the nature of sample surveys to be primarily concerned with the numerical estimation of quantities and relations between quantities....the task of presenting and explaining figures, even when successfully accomplished, does not result in the production of exciting literature. There is, further a class of people to be considered who, doubtless as a result of their early experience in mathematics in school, recoil with horror when confronted by a row of figures. I have great sympathy for such people and have reduced the use of figures in the text of the report to a minimum...I have tried, I hope successfully, to resist the temptation of speculating outside the range of the Survey evidence. Those with fewer inhibitions than myself are welcome to try their hand at this game.""13

To gather fresh data for this report, Dr Goh and his researchers personally interviewed the head of each of the 6,804 households sampled.14 Dr Goh's method, which stressed detailed field work, gave him and his team a first-hand feel of the ground which led to new insight into the issues studied. As Ms Tan Siok Sun, his daughter-in-law and biographer wrote, â€œGKS and his researchers ate with the trishaw drivers who they discovered rented not rooms, but beds in the Chinatown area. He learnt that a single bed would be shared by two â€˜tenants', one doing the day shift and the other the night shiftâ€.15
Despite the high office to which he rose and his exceptional talents, Dr Goh always remained a man of simple needs, lived a simple and frugal existence, and was ever ready to humble himself to relate with and aid his fellow men. His wife Dr Phua Swee Liang recalled,
""In his dealings with people, Keng Swee makes no distinction between race, religion, gender, wealth, or power provided they are genuine and decent. Regardless of how simple a view or need might be, he would lend a ear if it is expressed honestly and truthfully. His compassion and thoughtfulness for the common man have always moved and touched me...He has always led a simple and frugal life whether in his official capacity or in private life... Whenever he was warded in hospital, he would tear each tissue paper he wanted to use carefully into halves. He would then put one half back into the box for future use and use the other half. He would often chide me for being a wastrel when he saw that I used the whole sheet and added, â€˜its taxpayer's money'...[but] when the Dover Road Hospice asked for a donation of S$5,000 to purchase an electronic wheelchair for a patient, he wrote the cheque without a second thought.""16
His daughter-in-law, Ms Tan Siok Sun also recalled,
""Many who worked with him {Dr Goh} feared him, even those with high intellect and who were clearly competent in their respective fields. His reputation preceded him and followed him to the various ministries that he was put in charge of. Yet these same people respected his towering intellect and the common refrain was that he was a great mentor, and a remarkably patient teacher.""17
His outstanding human qualities won him the esteem of even his political adversaries, like the late David Marshall, the famous lawyer, first Chief Minister of Singapore, and critic of the Singapore government. Marshall paid this warm tribute to Dr Goh in an Oral History Interview he conducted with the National Archives of Singapore in 1984:
""Keng Swee was ....a man of â€˜sea-green' integrity, a man of personal charm and warmth if you got close to him, very humble. Genuinely, no showmanship about it, genuinely humble....he speaks to the high as well as to the low....with the same approach. He had an extraordinary....total freedom from arrogance, from superiority, from any inferiority; he just was....a natural human being. And to me, a perfect human being.....it's so much part of the air he breathes....to serve his country and his fellow human beings. And never a lie from him, never any malice from him...always treating me with courtesy and consideration. Never because I was a political opponent, treated me with ....unpleasant [ness]....never at all.""18

Back then, horse carriages and rickshaws were mainstays in transporting goods and people from the docks to the commercial city centre. (c.1900. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Johnston's Pier
Johnston's Pier was the predecessor to what most people would recognise as Clifford Pier today. It was officially opened on 13 March 1856 to help cope with the increase in sea-traffic, and was the first pier in Singapore that extended from the shore out to the sea.
Named after Alexander Laurie Johnston, one of Singapore's earliest European settlers, Johnston's Pier was also affectionately known as Lampu Merah (Malay) or Ang Teng (Hokkien), which means â€œRed Lampâ€. This was in reference to the red lantern hung at the end of the pier that served as a warning for incoming sea-faring vessels.
Besides regular trade and transport functions, Johnston's Pier was also the site of the annual New Year Regatta. This photo is credited back to 1900 and sees Malay kolek lumb all set for a race. (1996-00053. Image from National Museum of Singapore)

Becoming Clifford Pier
In 1927, Johnston's Pier size was deemed inadequate to handle the volume of traffic, leading to the construction of Clifford Pier that was officially opened on 3 June 1933 by then Governor of the Straits Settlements Cecil Clementi.
Designed in the Art-Deco style by Frank Dorrington Ward, Clifford Pier measured 204-foot long by 110-foot wide and was noted for the distinguishable concrete arched truss that enveloped the exterior.

Clifford Pier was also conveniently located just beside Commercial Square (today's Raffles Place) and more importantly, Change Alley, a popular area for many sailing crews who patronised its moneychangers and inexpensive goods. Over the years, Clifford Pier would continually experience transformation, from its post-war renovation in 1949, to its own version of â€œpop-up storesâ€ in the form of street hawkers appearing in the Pier's carpark late at night that catered to musicians and revelers looking for a taste of the city.
The Art-Deco elements of Clifford Pier are visible from far, along with the carpark that would be crowded with street hawkers once nightfall came. (c. mid-20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
The most major changes to Clifford Pier that we see today started back in 1970 with an S$120,000 facelift to introduce new shopping and office spaces to the area. In 1973, the S$7-million Change Alley Aerial Plaza â€“ an air-conditioned shopping complex that connected Clifford Pier to Change Alley was built.
1978 also saw the introduction of the iconic Red Lantern Revolving Restaurant, while the 1980s would see Clifford Pier transition into an embarkation point for people looking to reach the Southern Islands. The pier became particularly packed during the ninth lunar month when devotees headed to Kusu Island for their annual pilgrimage.
Come 1973, a slew of changes, most notably the S$7 million building of the Change Alley Aerial Plaza were built to cater to the increase in traffic and commercialisation around Clifford Pier. (c.1970s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Opened in 1978, the former Red Lantern Revolving Restaurant still stands as perhaps the most recognisable landmark of Clifford Pier from afar. (c.1980. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Clifford Pier today
On 1 April 2006, the last bumboat left Clifford Pier for its relocation to Marina South Pier to make way for the construction of the Marina Barrage. On 14 March 2007, it was granted conservation status, with many of its architectural features preserved. Today, Clifford Pier is part of the Fullerton Heritage Project, highlighted by its transformation to The Fullerton Bay Hotel that provides dining and hospitality options to visitors along the Singapore waterfront.

(c.1988. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Whether it was scaling the treacherous Peng Kang Hill in Jurong, being part of the pioneer batches trained by the Israeli Army, or simply taking the ferry from Tanah Merah to Pulau Tekong, the memories of National Service still resonate very much in the minds of the over 900,000 male citizens who have completed their National Service (NS) duty ever since it was introduced under the National Service (Amendment) Bill in 1967.
Before Conscription
Prior to the NS Bill of '67, the British had actually tabled their own bill back in 1952, on the grounds that a nation seeking self-government should be able to defend itself. The Ordinance was enacted on 1 March 1954, and required males between the ages of 18 and 20 to register for part-time national service. The first 1,000 national servicemen were chosen via public ballot on July 1954, and were drafted into the Singapore Military Forces and Civil Defence Corps.
Protest by Chinese Middle School students would however see a quick end to the bill, highlighted by a demonstration on 13 May where some 500 students held a protest against the bill by marching to the Government House. They eventually clashed with the police, resulting in 26 injuries and 45 arrests. The incident slowed down the enlistment process greatly, and the National Service Ordinance eventually fell through.
Introducing Conscription
The need for a capable defence force in Singapore was highlighted by two key events during its early years of independence, that of Singapore's separation from Malaysia and the impending withdrawal of the British Military.
The monumental task was put into the hands of then Defence Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee, and began with the introduction of the Ministry of Interior and Defence (MID) in August 1965, followed by the People's Defence Force (PDF) bill on 30 December on the same year. By March 1966, some 3,200 volunteers had already registered with the PDF, but their lack of military training and small numbers soon made Goh realise that compulsory conscription was needed to vastly expand Singapore's defence force.

On 14 March 1967, when the second reading of the National Service (Amendment) Bill and was passed, Goh declared that an initial batch of some 9,000 male youths born between 1 January 1949 and 30 July 1949 would be eligible for their National Service callup.
The enlistees would serve in one of four branches, namely the full-time army, PDF, Vigilante Corps and Special Constabulary. Those that were not selected for the army were allocated to the other divisions where they did only part-time training during their off duty hours, ensuring minimal disruption to their other career pursuits.

Early years of National Service
The first batches of eligible NS enlistees were registered at four stations located at Kallang, Katong, Serangoon and Bukit Panjang during the period between 28 March and 18 April 1967. All important documents had to be presented, and failure to register would result in an imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of S$2,000, or both.
In the early years of National Service, a lack of knowledge and amenities would see the pioneer batches trained by members from the Israeli Armed Forces, together with limited equipment as well as the iconic No.4 uniforms made from â€œTemasek Green cotton drillâ€ â€“ known to be so highly starched and pressed that they were able to stand on their own!

In 1970, the MID would diversify its operations, leading to the establishment of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to oversee all military related matters.

Evolution of National Service
Over the years, National Service would also experience numerous changes and improvements, including the introduction of the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) in 1980 as well as changes to the Basic Military Training (BMT) structure to accommodate enlistees who were either obese (1991) or achieved inadequate results in their IPPT (1993).
Since 1980, the fitness of enlistees is determined by their Performance in the Individual Physical Proficiency Test. (c.2000. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Today, there are a total of over 40 army camps, 2 naval bases and nine air force bases around the island equipped with the latest technology and facilities that have made the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) a well-respected army the world over. Beyond regular training of National Serviceman, the SAF has also been readily involved in providing aid at critical junctures both in Singapore (Laju incident in 1974, Hotel New World Collapse in 1986) as well as humanitarian relief efforts overseas (Medical Mission to East Pakistan in 1970, â€œOperation Flying Eagleâ€ for the Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami in 2004).

Having been sacked from their jobs after deploying adversarial tactics demanding better employment terms, 229 workers from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company took to the streets on 25 April 1955. Accompanied by students from Chinese middle schools as well as other sympathisers, the mob picketed bus stops and a depot in an attempt to urge other bus drivers to join their cause.
The strike eventually erupted into a full-blown riot comprising 2,000 people on May 12 the same year. By the end of the violent clashes, four people had lost their lives, and 31 were injured.

A brewing conflict
In a bid to improve labour and employment terms, left-wing trade unions began rallying workers to demand change from their employers in 1955. Tactics they suggested tended to be militant in nature.1
Chief Minister David Marshall speaking with Fong Swee Suan, the secretary of SBWU, who was under emergency detention for his involvement in the bus riots. (c1955. Image from the National Archives of Singapore)
Among the groups insisting on change was the Singapore Bus Workers' Union (SBWU). Under trade unionist Fong Swee Suan, the SBWU had by February that year garnered the support of 250 drivers from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company.2 The bus company's response was to dismiss two branch officials under its employ.
Complicating matters was the establishment of a new group called the Hock Lee Bus Employees' Union which the SBWU suspected had been initiated by the company itself. The new union comprised spare drivers who were paid a retainer fee of $2 a day.3
When 100 Hock Lee ground staff took a day off on 24 March to attend an SBWU meeting, the company viewed it as a mass resignation. It then dispatched workers from the Hock Lee Bus Employees' Union to take over their duties.
On 24 April 1955, dissatisfaction with the company reached a tipping point when 229 workers, all SBWU members, were dismissed at one go.4 Over the next two days, the unhappy drivers picketed the company's Alexandra Road bus depot and stopped buses from plying the roads, urging drivers to join them in their cause.5
A failed negotiation
Then Chief Minister David Marshall attempted to mitigate between SBWU and the Hock Lee Bus Company. The workers initially agreed to go back to work, but Fong Swee Swan, the union secretary, backed out of the agreement.6
With negotiations failing, strikes continued. On 11 May 1955, the police used high-pressure water jets to break up the angry mob.7

A day marked by violence
The situation intensified and climaxed on 12 May. When police deployed water hoses on rioting workers and Chinese students8, who also had grievances with the government and sympathised with the workers, they hit back with bricks and stones.
The day of violence ended with four people dead and 31 injured.9 Among the casualties was a 16-year-old student by the name of Chong Lon Chong who had been shot in the commotion and paraded around by protestors as an example of police brutality, delaying potentially life-saving treatment, and a volunteer constable who had been attacked with a garden hoe.10
Numerous protestors were detained by the police for their involvement in the riots. (c1955. Image from the National Archives of Singapore
The riot subsided in the early hours of 13 May. Working fast, the government closed three Chinese middle schools â€“ the Chinese High School, Chung Cheng High School and its branch school â€“ later in the day.
On 14 May, an agreement was reached between the bus company, SBWU and the Hock Lee Bus Employees' Union. SBWU's terms included the appointment of an arbitrator as well as the dissolution of the Hock Lee Bus Employees' Union. The arbitrator eventually ruled in favour of SBWU and 85 of the Hock Lee Bus Employees' Union's 170 workers were dismissed.11

The Instagram-worthy neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru â€” where some apartments command $1 million in the resale market â€” was once swamp land. In the 1930s, the British-run Singapore Improvement Trust transformed it into a housing estate to address overcrowding in the colony.
Replete with charming Art Deco blocks, Tiong Bahru has gone from strength to strength. In 2003 it was conserved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and began attracting a new crowd.1 It also caught the eye of foreign media which accorded it titles such as world's coolest neighbourhood.2
Flats built by the Singapore Improvement Trust. (c1960sâ€“1980s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
From dank swamp to housing haven
The land around Tiong Bahru Road was hilly, swampy and filled with disused graveyards. It sprung to life when settlers, forming a village called Kampong Tiong Bahru, began moving in, precipitated by the construction of a hospital (the present-day Singapore General Hospital) in nearby Outram in 1882.3
By the 1920s, the disorderly nature of the village and its unsanitary, hazardous living conditions began alarming health officials and the press. An editorial in The Straits Times dated 26 June 1930 went so far as to describe it as an â€œevil-smelling swampâ€.4
â€œâ€¦the land was practically all evil-smelling swamp, several feet below sea-level, with a dirty-looking creek running through it to the Singapore River. There were three fairly large hills on the far side from the main roads, and on these were numerous hovels, filthy and insanitary, occupied by squatters of the pig-breeding and coolie types.â€
- A scathing review of the Tiong Bahru area which appeared in The Straits Times on 26 June 1930.
In 1931, the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) decided that the time was ripe to transform the site into a more liveable area. It was also part of a larger push by the authorities to construct mass housing for Singapore's burgeoning population. The city was, after all, reeling from the side effects of slumlike living conditions â€” disease was rife and mortality rates were high across the colony â€” factors that could repel businesses and traders.
The SIT thus set out to clear the slums, reclaim the swamp, and prepare the land for a developer to build homes.5 The Trust had even carved out roads named after popular philanthropists such as Khoo Tiong Poh, Koh Eng Hoon and Seah Eu Chin.6
A report by the Singapore Improvement Trust. The British agency filled in swamps and levelled 72 acres of land in Tiong Bahru. The name Tiong Bahru is a combination of Hokkien and Malay words which mean new cemetery. (c. 1948. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Unfortunately, few developers took bait, the economy having only just recovered from a recession.7The SIT thus had little choice but to construct the housing estate on its own.8

More than 780 flats, inspired by modern European concepts of public housing, as well as British new towns like Stevenage, Harlow and Crawley, were completed between the years 1936 and 1941.10

Unfortunately, this first wave of construction, where tenants were charged $25 a month, did little to resolve Singapore's public housing scarcity since few from the working class could afford the rent.
Block 78. (c1953. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Blocks added after World War II, during a second wave of development, proved to be more popular. These units were spacious, and their environment pleasant and delightful thanks to the addition of footpaths and grass plots. By 1954, the SIT had built 1,258 flats to the northern side of Tiong Bahru. By the late 1950s, it was home to 17,000 residents including ladies of the night who worked at cabarets nearby, as well as the mistresses of Chinese businessmen. Stunning streetscapes
The estate of Tiong Bahru is a head-turner, home to an enchanting mix of low-rise buildings with distinctive street corners and eye-catching art deco motifs.11
Stunning streetscapes
Its modified Streamline Moderne pre-war buildings were designed by architect Alfred G. Church. Their clean, curved lines reminded locals of Kallang Airport's Art Deco control tower, which gave rise to the nickname â€œaeroplane towersâ€.
Tiong Bahru's post-war structures were built in the International Style. Thoughtfully placed portholes and curved staircases help reduce the blocks' severe appearance.12
In 2003, the Urban Redevelopment Authority decided to conserve 20 blocks. The estate's people-first design â€” it being punctuated with generous pockets of open green space, five-foot ways as well as ground floor amenities to encourage neighbourly interactions â€” was key to this decision.13
Design accents such as fair-faced brickwork highlighting certain balconies; winding rear staircases; and green glazed glass in window and door frames imported from England to keep out the glare of the tropics, helped further seal the deal.14
In the 2010s, the estate underwent gentrification which led to a surge in interest from a new generation of Singaporeans with spending power. In August 2020, one of its units fetched more than $1 million in the resale market.16

The beloved National Stadium was the site of sporting triumphs and losses, celebrations and concerts. It birthed sporting legends as well as the euphoric Kallang Roar and communal Kallang Wave. Its soaring concrete frame also hosted tens of thousands of Singaporeans who, on 18 occasions, gathered in a sea of red to mark the nation's birthday.
The site was not reserved for Singaporeans alone. When international headliners such as Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey took the stage, music fans from across the region descended upon the arena in Kallang to get in on the action. Built for the people, the venue took its final bow in 2011 â€” 38 years after it was completed, closing the chapter on what was once Southeast Asia's largest stadium.

A shot in the arm for Singapore's sports scene
Apart from new flats and factories, freshly independent Singapore was soon to get its first Olympic-standard stadium. It was December 1965 and Minister for Culture and Social Affairs Othman Wok had just recommended the construction of such a venue during a budget debate in parliament.
It must have been a fairly tough crowd to convince â€” sports was low on the list of priorities for the fledgling new nation. But Mr Othman justified it as an investment for the people, arguing that it would spark a sporting culture and place Singapore at the â€forefront in the field of international sportâ€.1 The cost of the project could be partially covered by proceeds from a legalised lottery, he added.2
His proposal was given the go-ahead and work began a year later in Kallang with Mr Othman driving in the first pile for the $50 million endeavour.

The stadium, the largest in Southeast Asia upon completion, had a barebones Brutalist design. Open-air with a concrete structural frame, it also housed state-of-the art features.3
In 1973, Singapore pulled out all the stops for its grand opening. An Olympic torch was shot into the night sky, trumpets were sounded and a 1,000-strong choir sang for the crowd. In his opening address, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew shared that while the stadium was a massive financial undertaking, it could become a â€œgreatâ€ social asset if it was â€œfully and properly usedâ€.4

A packed calendar
The people responded well to the stadium. It was a timely addition to the city and a vast improvement to the 10,000-seater Jalan Besar stadium, which failed to meet international standards.
The same year, the grand dame played host to the 7th Southeast Asian Peninsular Games as well as boxing world champion Muhammad Ali for exhibitions bouts as part of his tour of the Far East.
It was also the holy ground of football. Fans of team Singapore snapped up tickets during the 1970s, 1980s and mid-1990s to watch the Lions take on their rivals in the Malaysia Cup.5 From the stands, they cheered on their favourite players to sizzling, nail-biting finishes and were treated to gravity-defying kicks and great sportsmanship. This explained the thunderous roars, also known as the Kallang Roar, emanating from its grounds. It was at this very arena that football legends such as Quah Kim Song, Dollah Kassim, Fandi Ahmad and Varadarju Sundramoorthy, were born.6
The applause was not reserved for football heroes alone. Music fans kept their ears pricked for concerts by mega pop stars at the venue. They were not disappointed by the stadium's entertainment line-up. The venue, with its 55,000 pax capacity, attracted headliners and big stars like Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson and A-mei. It was also the venue of choice for religious rallies and community events such as when Pope John Paul II visited in 1986.
Indeed, the stadium had something for everyone.
Some add that it was â€œunrivalled as a venue for the unreserved expression of patriotism for generations of Singaporeansâ€.7 Such sentiments were best experienced at all 18 editions of National Day Parades which took the stadium by storm. Singaporeans, seated snugly in the arena, bonded as they cheered on their fellow countrymen performing in mesmerising flypasts and vibrant mass displays. Dazzling fireworks ended off such heady nights.

Bowing out
The curtains came down on the grand old dame between the years 2010 and 2011 â€” its closure having been in the works since 2001. Following the stadium's demolition, the present-day $1.33 billion Singapore Sports Hub, with up-to-date, world class facilities, was built in its place.8
The original landmark was closely documented during its final days, and a number of its fixtures such as turnstiles, floodlights and seats were salvaged.
Unfortunately, a time capsule with the stadium's building plans, sports memorabilia and newspaper clippings from 23 February 1970, was never found despite the extensive use of metal detectors and a $50,000 reward.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/golden-era-of-singapore-cinema/story,"The golden era of Singapore cinema occurred within a 25-year period from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, when hundreds of films were filmed and produced in Singapore by two major film empires, Cathay Organisation and Shaw Brothers.
Shaw Brothers, a film conglomerate set up by two Shanghainese brothers, Run Run and Runme Shaw, was already operating several cinemas in both Singapore and Malaysia. The brothers decided to make their foray into the film production arm following the success of their film exhibition and screening business.
With their sights on the Malay audience in both Singapore and Malaya, Shaw reopened the Jalan Ampas studio in 1947 and incorporated a new company known as the Malay Film Productions. This would kick-start the golden era of Singapore cinema. Shaw also invested heavily, bringing in the studio system of Hollywood to Singapore, and built up their own stable of crew including directors, producers, production support, and actors.
Between 1947 and 1952, Malay Film Productions produced around 37 feature films and set a record in 1952, rolling out 23 feature films in that year alone. Indian film director B. S. Rajhan was Shaw's only active director until 1950 and was well known for launching the film careers of many starlets such as Salleh Ghani, Rokiah Hanafi and P Ramlee.
In the following year, Loke Wan Tho created Cathay-Keris, with the help of Ho Ah Loke, who was already involved in the film exhibition businesses in northern Malaya and southern Thailand. Ho was keen to venture into film production after the end of World War II and convinced Loke to form Cathay-Keris. Cathay-Keris would become a major film studio that would challenge the monopoly of film production in the region by Shaw's Malay Film Productions.

Cathay-Keris managed to break away from the bangsawan (a type of traditional Malay opera or theatre) influence and were the first studio to produce films shot in colour. The first two films shot in colour in Singapore were Perwira Lautan Teduh (1952) and Bulan Perindu (1953).
Cathay-Keris was most noted for initiating the Singapore-made cult classic, the Pontianak film in 1957. The film was wildly popular, and screened in cinemas for two months. It was also dubbed into Cantonese and English for the Hong Kong and American markets. Cathay-Keris quickly followed up the success of the first Pontianak with Dendam Pontianak and Sumpah Pontianak. This became known as the Pontianak trilogy that established the horror genre in Singapore and Malaya. It also launched the film careers of Maria Menado and S. M. Satay, and featured the music composed by Zubir Said, best known as the composer of Singapore's National Anthem. Malay Film Productions would emulate the horror genre formula and launch their own Pontianak film series.

The golden era of Singapore cinema would see a turn at the 1960s, with more audiences turning to imported films from Hollywood. The introduction of television in Singapore also contributed to a decline in movie attendances. The separation of Singapore from Malaysia also led to a talent drain, with many directors, producers and artistes choosing to base themselves permanently in either side of the causeway. Ho left Cathay-Keris and Singapore, and became one of the founding fathers of Merdeka Studio in Kuala Lumpur. He also brought with him the rights to some of the most successful Cathay-Keris films. Among the starlets who chose to move to Malaysia was entertainer extraordinaire P Ramlee.
A photograph of popular starlet P Ramlee. (c. 1960s. 2005-01056. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Shaw Brothers would close the Malay Film Productions studios in Singapore in 1967. Its 20-year run saw a generation of around 160 feature films produced from its Jalan Ampas studios. Cathay-Keris ceased operations in 1972, with at least a hundred films produced from its studios.
The competition between Shaw and Cathay led to the earliest developments of film production in Singapore, where hundreds of films predominantly in Malay were produced over a 25-year span. The closure of Malay Film Productions and Cathay-Keris marked the end of the golden era of Singapore cinema in the early 1970s.

At 18, P. Govindasamy Pillai ran away from home, boarding a ship in Tamil Nadu for Singapore. The early days were tough for Pillai as he struggled to find a job. When he was given the chance to work in a provision shop, Pillai wasted no time learning the ropes. Along the way he bought over the store and opened branches bearing his initials. In 1963, his business empire was valued at $3 million.

Humble beginnings
P. Govindasamy Pillai (1887â€“1980) was born in the village of Koorainadu in Tamil Nadu. He ran away from home in his teens and boarded a ship for Singapore, arriving in 1905 at the age of 18.1
Pillai found life in Singapore tough. He struggled to find employment and with just 13 rupees to his name, was unable to afford food and lodging.2 His circumstances improved somewhat after a provision store owner at 50 Serangoon Road got him to work in exchange for food and board. Pillai's hours were punishing with work starting before the break of dawn and ending only after midnight.
Fully immersed in the world of provision shop operations, Pillai picked up the skills and knowledge needed to run the business fairly quickly. In 1929, he borrowed $2,000 to buy the store following the demise of its owner. It was a far-sighted move on the part of Pillai who had just gotten married. The lessons from his late employer were not forgotten and Pillai spent long hours fine-tuning and running the enterprise.3
Self-made millionaire
For the convenience of his customers, Pillai began selling a wider variety of products ranging from canned goods to shoes. He also opened branches in Little India. People began associating the P. Govindasamy Pillai name, which his business was named after, with convenience.

Although the business day was long â€” work started at 7am and ended around 9pm â€” Pillai took care of his staff. They were given two hour lunch breaks and lodging at his home.4
Having found his stride, Pillai began setting aside money to invest in other ventures. He opened flour and spice mills, and started five saree shops.5, 6 He also invested in properties in Serangoon Road, Race Course Road and Buffalo Road, and even managed to build houses in Little India.7
During the Japanese Occupation, Pillai's family managed to escape unscathed but it was a different story for his properties which were destroyed during the war. Undeterred, Pillai began rebuilding his business empire, doing well enough to open PGP Stores in Malacca and Johor. By 1963, the year of his retirement, Pillai's business was valued at S$3 million.
Pillai died at the ripe old age of 93 in 1980.
In 1998, the PGP Stores, having chalked up huge debts, were shuttered.
Investing in the community
Pillai, having been impoverished for a good part of his life, made it a point to help others throughout his life. In 1952, he paid for a new home for the Ramakrishna Mission Singapore, an organisation which renders aid to the needy. He also contributed generously to institutions such as Mount Alvernia Hospital and the University of Malaya.

It's hard to imagine Singapore without the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT). With over 148 km of rail across 106 stations, an estimated 3 million people commute to work, school and other destinations on a daily basis. First open to passengers in 1987, the MRT had actually been a long time coming, with planning done as early as the 1960s.

Fueling the future
Just 2 years after Singapore's independence, in 1967, a study was done by the Singapore State and City Planning Department and the United Nations Development Programme. It projected a population of 3.4 million by 1992 and that called for a better road network, and an efficient public transport system to cope with the increasing population.
The Singapore Mass Transit Study
As Singapore entered a new decade, traffic congestion had worsened and it became crucial to find solutions to ease the congestion. In 1972, the government sent a team of consultants and officers to start the Singapore Mass Transit Study. In its first phase, the team recommended an investment in public transportation, in particular for a rail mass transit, as the best solution to cope with the travel demands.
The second phase of the study showed that a bus-rail system was far superior to an all-bus system â€“ economically, financially, and technically. However, whether or not to construct an MRT system was a difficult decision to make, due to the high costs and possible impacts on land use and economic activities.
The final phase of this study, conducted between 1979 and 1980, provided the first designs for the recommended transit system. With this blueprint, a Provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority was appointed in 1980 to start the first preparations for building a possible MRT system.

In May 1982, after an extensive study, the government was convinced that Singapore would greatly benefit from an MRT system and decided to build and completely finance the S$5-billion project.

Then Minister for Communications, Ong Teng Cheong, announced the decision and revealed that the MRT system would not only improve public commuting significantly, but also draw in more investors in the long run, and increase the land value in the country.
On the right track
In 1983, MRT Corporation replaced the Provisional MRT Authority and took charge of constructing and operating the MRT system. In 1987, the operations of the system were handed over to a new company called Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) Ltd.
The initial MRT system was to be 67 km long, across three lines with 42 stations: North-South Line from Yishun to Marina Bay; East-West Line from Pasir Ris to Boon Lay; and the Western Line between Jurong Town and Bukit Panjang.
The North-South Line was the first section to be constructed because this part of the city had the most commuters and congestion.
All aboard!
On 7 November 1987, a five-station segment from Toa Payoh to Yio Chu Kang opened its doors to the first passengers. Thousands of curious Singaporeans came to try out the MRT on the first day alone. A month later, on 12 December 1987, nine more stations were added from Novena to Outram Park.
Then Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, officially launched the MRT system on 12 March 1988. By April, the MRT had already become a daily mode of transport for at least 200,000 people.

Connecting every corner of Singapore
In 1996, a 16-km extension to Woodlands began serving passengers. The North East Line from Punggol through busy downtown to Harbourfront opened in 2003. The Circle Line opened all its stations in October 2011 and the Downtown Line was completed in October 2017. The Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) is projected to be completely up and running by 2023.

The government announced in 2020 that a total of S$87.5 billion had been set aside for new rail projects in the next decade, which will include even more lines and stations to boost the transport system even further.

It's hard to imagine Singapore without this world-class public transport system. MRT stations have now become their own landmarks, featuring avant-garde architecture, international art installations from renowned artistes, and even serve as unique Instagram-worthy public spaces.

Did you know that eight out of the eleven public holidays in Singapore are celebrations originating from our various religions and cultures1? Singapore today is known to be a colourful mix of cultures, faiths, and communities. Naturally, our festivals are a rich celebration of our multicultural heritage, as we get to indulge in the sights, sounds, and flavours from our diverse origins.
A migration of festivities
To truly understand how Singapore became such a melting pot of cultures, we have to go back two centuries to when the country was first established as a bustling trading hub of the region.
Singapore's special position on the world map naturally put it in the middle of many trade routes. Vessels from all over the world stopped here to resupply or trade. Immigrants from China, India, and the Malay Archipelago, among others, flocked here to seek greater fortunes.
After long, treacherous journeys by sea, many of our forefathers built places of worship along the coast at Telok Ayer Street. Temples, mosques, churches, and shrines were established for the immigrants to give thanks to their gods2 for providing them safe passage, and to ask for blessings in the new chapter of their lives. Telok Ayer Street is today the street with the most number of national monuments in Singapore. With the freedom to practise their faiths freely, our immigrants also brought with them the festivals celebrated by the Muslims, Hindus, and the Chinese â€“ festivals that have grown to become the vibrant spectacles of modern Singapore.
Let's begin our festival journey with the first celebration of the year.
Pongal
Usually in: January, place of origin: India
A beautiful festival of offering thanks to nature, Pongal is traditionally a harvest festival originating from South India celebrated in the beginning of Thai, the tenth Tamil month. Cooked rice is traditionally offered to the deities to thank them for a bountiful harvest3.
The Pongal bazaar at Campbell Lane4 is where local Indians can find their favourite goodies and buy offerings such as the Indian sugar cane, ginger and turmeric plants, and devotional milk pots5.
The Pongal bazaar is a feast of the senses and perfect for immersing yourself in the festival atmosphere. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
Lunar New Year
Usually in: January or February, place of origin: China6
Squeezing through the crowds at the Chinatown night market7 in the month leading up to Lunar New Year is perhaps an experience every Singaporean Chinese gladly shares. Entire streets decorated in splashes of red and gold, massive light displays8, long queues outside popular bakwa (barbecued pork) stalls9, and street vendors loudly touting traditional goodies and introducing the latest flavours.10
Lunar New Year is the most anticipated festival among the local Chinese community. Celebrated on the first day of the Chinese Lunar Calendar, the entire fiesta lasts 15 days. On New Year's Eve, every Chinese, no matter which corner of the world they might be in, would return home to their family for a reunion dinner.11 After the meal, many families would gather around the TV to watch the countdown performance broadcasted from Chinatown.12
The following morning, everyone puts on new clothes to welcome new beginnings, and visit their relatives to exchange blessings13, never once taking a break from the mouth-watering pineapple tarts, and other festival snacks. This goes on for two weeks, punctuated by steamboat dinners, yusheng ceremony (raw fish salad tossing)14, and even more gatherings with friends and relatives.15
The Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple is packed with devotees every Chinese New Year's Eve offering their prayers. Many believe that the first person to offer their incense will receive bountiful blessings during that year. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
The River Hong Bao is a week-long extravaganza16 held every Chinese New Year along the Singapore River since 198717. This five-storey high Monkey God18 was the main attraction for the celebration of the Year of the Monkey. (c. 1992. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Since 197319, the Chingay Parade is an annual street festival participated by members of every ethnic community. The procession is a multi-sensory spectacle of floats representing different grassroots associations and communities. (c. 1970sâ€“80s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Thaipusam
Usually in: January or February20, place of origin: India, religious roots: Hinduism
For Hindus, one of the most powerful ways of showing devotion to their deities takes place at the annual Thaipusam Festival. On the full-moon day in the month of Thai in the Tamil calendar, Hindus in Singapore commemorate the victory of Lord Subramaniam (also known as Lord Murugan) over the evil forces with a vel (spear), an element which has become the most recognisable part of the festival21. 
The most pious believers pierce their bodies and faces with hundreds of needles from their kavadi22, a structure of at least 20 kg23 in weight that they carry, and walk barefoot for 3 to 4 km24 as an offering to the deity. This arduous walk of faith stretches from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. Devotees are usually cheered on by close friends and families, who walk together with them while carrying palkudam (devotional milk pots)25.
Thousands of bystanders offer additional encouragement along the route, starting on Serangoon Road and finishing Tank Road, eager to be part of the devotees' journey of devotion.
Only the most pious devotees carry the kavadi for this 4-km walk. Here is a shot from the procession along Selegie Road. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
The kavadi is carried primarily with a belt and pierced to the body using hooks, needles and spikes. (c. 1970â€“1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Kavadis are traditionally made of wood or steel, and adorned with peacock feathers, milk pots, flowers, and pictures of deities. (c. 20th century. Image from Asian Civilisations Museum)
Vesak Day
Usually in: May, place of origin: Nepal / Sri Lanka, religious roots: Buddhism
Buddhists from around the world honour Vesak Day as a commemoration to Buddha's birth and enlightenment. Celebrated on the full-moon day of May27, Buddhists come together to remind their communities of Buddha's teachings and to renew their resolutions of leading a life of morality, humility, and simplicity.28
Around Singapore, Buddhists visit temples and offer flowers, joss sticks, and prayers,29 while the more devout perform a â€œThree Steps, One Bowâ€ ritual to express repentance. Monks also give talks about peace and happiness at temples, and how the 25-century-old teachings apply to the islander's fast-paced urban life.31
Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery is well known for the â€œThree Steps, One Bowâ€ ritual performed by its devotees on the eve of Vesak Day every year.
Hari Raya Puasa
Place of origin: Middle East, religious roots: Islam
Hari Raya Puasa, also known as Hari Raya Aidilfitri, is the celebration of the end of Ramadan, the islamic month of fasting and prayer. On the first day of Syawal, or the tenth month of the Islamic calendar, the Muslim community gathers to bond, feast, and to celebrate. As families come together32, the younger generation would take turns to kiss the hand of their elders as a sign of respect, while asking them for forgiveness.33 A beautiful practice common in Southeast Asia, families would put on the same colours when they go out visiting to show their unity.34
The Hari Raya Light-up at Geylang Serai is one of the biggest highlights of the festival, with miles of brightly lit stalls selling a wide variety of Malay culinary delights, gifts, and clothes at the Ramadan bazaar.
During Hari Raya Puasa, we get to indulge in the famous beef rendang (spicy beef stew), ketupat (rice cakes wrapped in coconut leaves), and lontong (rice cakes with coconut gravy). And of course, the celebration isn't complete without the delicious kueh (sweets) and biscuits, which are must-haves for every family.35

Hari Raya Haji
Place of origin: Middle East, religious roots: Islam
A sacred festival of sacrifice and sharing, Hari Raya Haji marks the end of Haj37, or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims across Singapore gather in mosques for prayers while the Korban ritual is performed. Lambs and sheep are sacrificed and the meat will be distributed to the poor and needy. This symbolic ritual honours Prophet Ibrahim's devotion in offering his own flesh and blood as a sacrifice to Allah.38
An occasion of sharing and giving, devotees help to distribute meat to the needy on Hari Raya Haji at Sultan Mosque. (c. 2013. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
Mid-Autumn Festival
Usually in: September or October39, place of origin: China
Also called the Lantern Festival among the local Chinese community40, Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated on the full moon (fifteenth day) of the eighth month of the Chinese lunar calendar.41 Giant lantern displays are put up in Chinatown throughout the month to mark this special occasion.42 On this evening, children parade the streets with their own lanterns while adults come together to eat mooncakes and appreciate what they believe to be the roundest and brightest moon of the year.43
Every year, local bakeries and restaurants use this occasion to come up with creative twists to the traditional mooncake, infusing popular flavours such as durian, strawberry, and even truffles.44
Chinatown is also home to the annual Mid-Autumn Light-Up Ceremony. This is a shot from the finale performance in 2015. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
The mooncake, a traditional Chinese pastry eaten during Mid-Autumn Festival, usually comes in exquisite boxes such as this.

This mooncake mould is made of hardwood. The four motifs seen her are the Chinese characters for èŠ±å¥½æœˆåœ†, signifying a beautiful time of flowers blossoming under the full moon. (c. 1970s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Deepavali
Usually in: October or November, place of origin: India, religious roots: Hindusim
The Festival of Lights is one of the most important festivals for Hindus.45 This day is a celebration of the victory of Lord Krishna over King Narakasura, the triumph of good over evil, and light conquering darkness.46
Little India bursts into life with hundreds of metres of decorative lighting, bazaars, and celebratory activities, as devotees flock to the temples to offer their prayers.47 Follow the scent of floral garlands and incense as you browse through the colourful stalls filled with traditional snacks, embroidered sari (traditional Indian womenswear), and thousands of bangles.48
The Sri Mariamman Temple, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore49, also hosts a fiery spectacle a week leading up to Deepavali. Here, you can join thousands of devotees as they walk on burning charcoal as a tribute to the goddess Sri Drowpathai Amman.50

Christmas
Falls on: 25 December, place of origin: Rome, religious roots: Christianity
In December every year, malls along Orchard Road showcase their themed decorations and Christmas trees, turning the entire shopping street into a parade of lights.51 Our tropical Christmas is celebrated by most as an occasion to indulge in our favourite hobbies â€“ eating and shopping. Christmas menus pop up in every restaurant and our retail outlets lure in shoppers with Christmas sales and promotions.52
For the Christians in Singapore, the season of sharing brings the community together in churches for prayers and midnight masses. Traditional Christmas meals take on a creative local twist, infused with our favourite spices such as ginger, chilli, and even curry.
When night falls, that's when the real show on Orchard Road begins. Over the years, the Christmas decorations have gotten increasingly creative and magnificent. (c. mid 1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/singapore-shophouses/story,"TL;DR
Before the era of colossal skyscrapers, mega retail complexes and dense, high rise HDB flats, Singapore's built landscape was largely dominated by quaint shophouses. Based on the Chinese courtyard house style, with modifications to suit the tropics, shophouse properties were generally constructed between the 1840s and 1960s. Over time, six distinct architectural styles, beginning with Sir Stamford Raffles' barebones rendition, emerged.

A defining look for the port city: Raffles' prototype
Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore, had a pretty clear idea of how he wanted the port city to look from the get-go. On November 4 1822, he issued a set of ordinances defining the building type he preferred dominating the cityscape.
His building stipulations served as a template for the construction of squat, two-storey units anchored by a business on the ground floor with the residence of the proprietor sited above â€” what we refer to as the shophouse today.
Raffles dictated that these houses â€œhave a verandah of a certain depth, open at all times as a continued and covered passage on each side of the streetâ€.1 The resulting five-foot ways were intended to provide pedestrians relief from the tropical heat and protection from the rain and street traffic.2
The iconic five-foot way was introduced by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. (c.2014. Image from lionraw.com)
This was Raffles' take on Chinese courtyard houses.3 Settlers from the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian had brought their blueprints to Singapore.4 Raffles' version was later replicated in city centres across the region.5 In Singapore, shophouses started appearing in the city centre in the 1840s before spreading across to other neighbourhoods over the course of a century.6
Shophouses originally served merchants and their families. This changed as large waves of immigrants moved to Singapore. In need of accommodation, shophouses soon evolved into cramped, unhygienic shared dwellings.7
â€œUniversalâ€ features of a shophouse
The archetypal Singapore shophouse comes with five-foot ways and strong symmetry.8 It has a long and narrow floor plan, reflecting the Southern China practice of taxing buildings based on their widths.9 Shophouses typically have internal courtyards, open stairwells and skylights.10
Overtime, six distinct typologies of shophouses emerged.
Within these categories, sub-design styles also surfaced. Take for instance the Chionoshire. This style is characterised by the extensive use of Chinese decorative elements such as flowers, vases with peonies, birds, cranes, peacocks, dragons, phoenixes and zodiac characters.11
Then there is the Rococo style where almost every inch of the shophouse facade is covered with ornamentation in a layered, â€œwedding cakeâ€ style.12
Western design elements, such as Georgian style fanlights and classical mouldings in the Roman Doric style, entered the shophouse scene in the mid-1880s.13
Rudimentary and squat: the Early Shophouse style (1840s-1900s)
The first rendition of the shophouse was rudimentary in nature with minimal ornamentation and decorative elements. It had shutters for windows and a roof made out of locally produced clay tiles. It was a reflection of the times, when resources such as skilled labour and building materials were limited and basic at best.
Raffles' shophouse â€œprototypeâ€ rose south of the river, between South Bridge and New Bridge Roads.14 South Bridge Road was one of Singapore's main thoroughfares which connected the town to New Harbour, present-day Keppel Harbour.15 Wholesale and retail merchant traders, as well as godowns and goldsmith shops chose to locate their businesses here to capitalise on the traffic.
Singapore's earliest shophouses were built along South Bridge Road. Major James Low of the Madras Army who visited Singapore during this period, wrote that he enjoyed browsing the items on sale along their â€œpiazzasâ€ (five-foot ways). (c. Early 20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Elegant simplicity: the First Transitional Shophouse style (early 1900s)
No longer a fledgling settlement, skilled labourers began pouring into Singapore. Among them were craftsmen who added decorative plasterwork and colourful tiles to the facades of shophouses, bringing a cheerier look to the city's streets.16
Structurally speaking, the shophouses of this era tended to be taller than their predecessors. Their timber windows were also fitted with small panels of glass.
By the 1900s, a second typology of shophouses emerged. This time, the units were taller and more elegant compared to the rudimentary nature of their predecessors. (c.1920s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
An exuberant riot of colours: the Late Shophouse style (1900-1940)
The third wave of shophouses in Singapore, known for having three instead of two windows on their upper floors, added explosions of colour and head-turning eclecticism to the streets of Singapore. Artisans, drawing inspiration from across the globe, generously adorned facades with detailed plaster, tile and cast iron ornamentation work.
Many of these lavishly decorated shophouses were funded by people who had come into wealth during the rubber boom (1900-1930).17
The Late Shophouse style can be found along Emerald Hill where exuberant Peranakan tiles, decorative Corinthian columns and pilasters, full-length French windows,18 bat-motif vent openings, and carved swing-doors continue to delight residents, locals and tourists alike.19

Shedding ornamentation: the Second Transitional Shophouse style (late 1930s)
The shophouses that rose during this era were more subdued. Developers dialled back on embellishments and kept colours and tiles muted, focusing instead on simple, streamlined geometric forms.
This could have been a matter of personal taste with the rising influence of the international Art Deco movement, or a reflection of the economic circumstances of the time as a result of The Great Depression (August 1929â€“March 1933).
Clean lines please: the Art Deco Shophouse Style (1930-1960)
Geometric patterns, streamlined capitals, as well as clean arches and keystones anchor the Art Deco Shophouse Style.21
These shophouses are also known for their date plaques which capture the year of their completion.22
Art Deco shophouses can be found along 486-588 Serangoon Road. These have fair-faced brickwork and symmetrical corner facades.23
Back to basics: the Modern Shophouse Style (1950-1960)
Pragmatic design and utilitarian features are hallmarks of the Modern Shophouse style which produced more severe looking properties.
To improve ventilation across these spaces, builders added thin concrete fins and air vents, sticking closely to the disciplined geometric proportions of the style.

Roof-raising demand for shophouses
Attesting to their timeless quality, Singapore's shophouses can net their owners millions in the resale market.
In 2022, for instance, five adjoining shophouses on Club Street, in the Telok Ayer conservation area, were placed on sale for $28.5 million.24
Against a limited supply, the value of these properties have been buoyed by investors eager for aesthetically pleasing and historically rooted places to pilot fresh business concepts. Among them are operators of trendy co-living spaces who have been snapping up shophouses across the city.
You, however, do not need deep pockets to enjoy these charming properties. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has conserved about 6,500 shophouses â€” a number of which are partially or fully accessible to the public.
For instance, a stroll through Chinatown will take you to a majestic, three-storey shophouse at the intersection of Keong Saik Road, Teck Lim Road and Jiak Chuan Road. The space is occupied by a modern F&B establishment.25
You can also go on a photowalk to capture the delightful pastel hues of Koon Seng Road's shophouses, or plan a stay at a shophouse hotel in Little India or Kampong Glam.26 The ball, as they say, is in your court.

Notes",Roots Website,Singapore Shophouses
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/traditional-trades/story,"While they may not look like it, many of the traditional trades in Singapore, from traditional Coffee powder grinders to Street barbers were early entrepreneurs who helped lay the foundation for the rise of modern craftsmen such as tailors with their bespoke suits, or baristas and their artisanal coffee.
Watch: A Traditional Coffee Powder Grinder
Mr Tan Boon Hong and his son, Mr Tan Peck Ho are some of the last traditional coffee powder grinders left in Singapore. Their shop, Lam Yeo Coffee Powder, has been around since 1959.

Watch: An Encounter with a Street Barber
Street barbers such as Lee Yong Tong, who has been in the trade for more than 50 years are now very much a rarity that cater to a small but loyal following.
Many of these traditional trades arose in the early days of Singapore's history as a means of survival. Though some were undoubtedly influenced from skills and cultures adapted from their respective homelands, a majority were developed to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing population and changing society.
Traditional trades and the craftsmen that practice it were visible in all sectors of Singapore's socio-economic landscape ranging from food and trade, to lifestyle and entertainment. Though many of these craftsmen and their trades have since vanished, their ability to adapt their skills and businesses to the changing landscape till this day is a testament to their continued ingenuity and perseverance.
The Craftsmen
Before the days of street art and computer graphic design, hand-painted movie posters were all the rage, especially during the era of Singapore's Golden Age of Cinema. Hand-drawn movie poster painters like Ang Hao Sai, who first became an apprentice in a poster studio in 1963, were in great demand to help churn out promotional posters for films produced by the likes of Cathay Keris and Shaw Brothers' Studio. Although Ang closed his studio in 1987, he has reinvented his business and has continued in his craft till today.
Mr Ang Hao Sai first became an apprentice at a poster studio in 1963 at a time of Singapore's Golden Age in Cinema. His own studio had to close down in 1987 but he has since reinvented himself to meet the demands of a modern society.
On a more personal note, Letter writers such as Mr. Thangaraju, who first came to Singapore from South India in 1951, provided an affordable means of communication between immigrants and their families back home at a time when long-distance phone calls and formal education were a rarity. For him, his own experience as an immigrant undoubtedly helped to lend a sense of empathy to the letters he wrote. Letter writing slowly died out in the 1970s due to lack of clients and improving education in Singapore.
The story of Singapore's infrastructure would not be complete without the contributions of Samsui women such as Ms Ng Moey Chye. Along with many others who hailed from the sanshui (Samsui in Cantonese) region in China, she would carry heavy loads of bricks and construction material to-and-fro work sites between Chinatown and Collyer Quay, while donning the iconic red headscarf that ensured their visibility at work sites while storing their personal belongings all at once.
On the domestic front, Urut ladies, or Malay midwifes, such as Madam Runtia Binte Murtono played an important role in helping new mothers through their first few months after delivering by conducting traditional post-natal rituals. This included urut, a traditional massage technique handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation.
Still holding strong
While many traditional trades and craftsmen have since retired or developed into other trades, a good few such as the Bumboat operators of Pulau Ubin, Traditional confectioneries and Second-hand book sellers continue to provide daily necessities and services to a small but grateful audience. Their contribution to Singapore's rich cultural heritage and entrepreneurial spirit is an invaluable asset that contributes not just to the socio-economic makeup of our society, but the identity of Singapore as nation.
Watch: The Boat Operators of Pulau Ubin
For boat operators like Jie Gao Cai, life on the seas started way back when he was just 14 years old as a crew members on board one of the bumboats. He received his manning license at the age of 18 and has been a boat operator ever since.
Watch: A Traditional Teochew Confectionary
For family businesses like Gin Thye Cake Maker who have been around since 1964, the attention to ingredients, recipes and techniques help ensure that customers get only the freshest and most delicious confections.
Goldsmiths were a common sight along Buffalo Road during the 1960s. Many stores would create an array of traditional Indian jewellery worn by many Indian brides during their wedding day. Watch a goldsmith craft a 'M Thali' with Perumal Motif here.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/black-and-white-houses-in-singapore/story,"TL;DR
Typically situated in lush, wooded environments, and occasionally overlooking valleys, the black and white bungalows of Singapore are a legacy of the island's colonial past. Built between 1903 and 1941, these stately residences were typically occupied by the well-heeled. 
Singapore's pool of black-and-white homes are now managed by the state. Some have been converted into restaurants and bars in areas such as Dempsey Hill, Rochester Park and Seletar Aerospace Park.
The rest are generally occupied by well-heeled Singaporeans and expatriates, as well as foreign embassies. (c2014. Image from ghettosingapore.com) 
The Bungalows of early Singapore
An 1823 sketch of the town of Singapore, by Lieutenant Philip Jackson, depicts single-storey timber buildings with long verandahs gracing the shoreline. 1 These were mostly Anglo-Indian bungalows â€” a style introduced by British settlers. 2
By the mid-19th century, local features were added to the design of the aforementioned bungalow style. For instance, the structure was raised above the ground â€” a feature likely inspired by indigineous Malay architecture, where homes are propped up on stilts to keep interiors cool and floods at bay. 3
Architectural historian Julian Davison branded the union of both styles as the â€œAnglo-Malay bungalowâ€. The style is also known for its lofty ceilings, tiled roofs, deep overhanging eaves, classical columns on plinths as well as broad verandahs. 4
Both the Anglo-Indian bungalow and the Anglo-Malay house serve as the foundation of the black and white house.5

#trending in 1903: the genesis of Singapore's black and whites
According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the black and white bungalow is known for its overhanging hipped roof, use of half timber construction, open ground floor as well as verandahs on the second storey with a carriage porch below. 6 Its name is a nod to the house's dark timber beams and whitewashed walls.
Meanwhile, the Singapore Land Authority, which manages the bulk of Singapore's remaining black and whites, describes the style as the â€œcross-pollination of indigenous Malayan and mock-tudor featuresâ€. 7
How did the trend of black and white living take flight? 
This has been attributed to gifted architect, Regent Alfred John Bidwell (1869â€“1918) of Swan & Maclaren, who produced the pioneering design of the now defunct W. Patchitt House at Cluny Road in 1903. Davison describes the home as having had a half-timbered mock-Tudor upper storey constructed over a classically detailed masonry ground floor, as well as a soaring roof with two square towers at either end of its front elevation.  
Renowned in London and well-versed in a wide array of architectural trends, Bidwell was prolific in Singapore for designing iconic structures such as the fabled Raffles Hotel. His Cluny Road home set the stage for other black and whites.
Architect Regent Alfred John Bidwell didn't just kickstart the black-and-white house trend, he also designed the world famous Raffles Hotel (above), Victoria Concert Hall and Singapore Cricket Club. (c1902. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Its evolution
Demand for black and white houses spiked among the well-heeled of Singapore as a result of Bidwell's revolutionary design. Top-ranking government officials, barristers and brokers were among those who bought up large plots of land and commissioned architectural practices like Bidwell's Swan & Maclaren to design their residences. 8
Over time, other influences, such as tropical Edwardian, trickled into the architectural lexicon of Singapore's black and white houses.
The colony's black and white chapter concluded abruptly as a result of World War II. The last of Singapore's black and whites were of the military black and white style which can be found in areas like Alexandra, Changi, Seletar and Sembawang. 9
During the 1920s and 30s, black-and-white houses were built to accommodate military personnel working at the nearby Seletar Airbase. 10(c.2014. Image from lionraw.com)

Telok Ayer, which once hugged Singapore's old coastline, was envisioned as a Chinese district in Sir Stamford Raffles' 1822 town plan. The diverse community of immigrants that landed on its shores, however, had its own say. Over time, a clutch of religiously and culturally diverse institutions sprouted up to serve their needs.

(Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
A bay of hopes and dreams
News of the colony's commercial vibrancy made ripples across Asia. Risking life and limb, immigrants, eager to leave behind impoverished circumstances, embarked on perilous journeys in overcrowded junks for a fresh start in Singapore. Many of the vessels they came on would have docked along Telok Ayer's seafront.
Upon setting foot on shore, looking for accomodation and job matching assistance would have been a priority, however the religious among them would have likely made a first stop at the makeshift shrines along the waterfront to give thanks for safe passage.

Life was pretty rough for immigrants. Telok Ayer itself, which was generally occupied by the Chinese as per the design of the Raffles Town Plan of 1822, soon became overcrowded and a hub for the slave trade.2
The British made some adjustments to the site beginning in the late 1800s via reclamation works which pushed Telok Ayer Street four streets away from the seafront. Cecil Street, Robinson Road and Shenton Way were subsequently built on the reclaimed land.
Even more has changed since then, with the area now home to skyscrapers and modern buildings. Despite these sweeping changes, the imprint of Singapore's early immigrants still exists in the form of six historic buildings: the Thian Hock Keng temple, Singapore Yu Huang Gong, Ying Fo Fui Kun, the Al-Abrar Mosque, Nagore Dargah and the Telok Ayer Methodist Church. The National Heritage Board gazetted these as national monuments between the years 1973 and 2009, and they remain as tangible representations of our forebears' fears, hopes and dreams.
Join us as we walk you through Telok Ayer's multicultural, national gems.
Ying Fo Fui Kun, No. 98 Telok Ayer Street
Ying Fo Fui Kun, a clan association, strove to help new Hakka immigrants find accommodation and jobs in Singapore. Most Hakkas worked as woodcutters and carpenters as well as blacksmiths and goldsmiths.
Established in 1822, just three years after Stamford Raffles landed, this cosy, two-storey clan provided Hakka settlers with job matching services and temporary respite3 after the long journey at sea.
Its name reflects its founders' desire for peaceful coexistence among the Hakkas of Singapore4 â€” the fourth largest Chinese dialect group. The late founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, as well as the Aw brothers of Tiger Balm fame, are among some of Singapore's most well-known Hakkas.
The monument's appearance resembles clan-temple buildings common in the southeastern coastal region of Guangdong, China. As you walk by, take note of the windows along its facade for they have been positioned pretty high off the ground to discourage intruders.
Nagore Dargah Indian-Muslim Heritage Centre, No. 140 Telok Ayer Street

Walk a little further down the street and you'll be greeted by the peach and white limestone Nagore Dargah Indian-Muslim Heritage Centre â€” a replica of an Indian shrine in Tamil Nadu devoted to 13th century Muslim saint Shahul Hamid who was known for his ability to protect sailors and seafarers.
Seeking a new life, Chulia immigrants who worked primarily as traders and money changers, left their homes along the windswept Coromandel Coast in southern India for Singapore. Before embarking on the long voyage, they visited the saint's shrine in the town of Nagore to pray for safe passage.
The Chulias built a version of this shrine in Telok Ayer between the years 1828 and 1830. The building boasts eclectic architecture. Think Doric columns and arches as well as large French style windows.5 Look closely and you will be able to spot niches in its towers â€” oil lamps used to be placed in these little lots during festivals. In 2011, it was relaunched as the Nagore Dargah Indian Muslim Heritage Centre.
Singapore Yu Huang Gong, No. 150 Telok Ayer Street
Just a few doors down stands the former Keng Teck Whay building â€” the only surviving Peranakan ancestral hall and clan complex in Singapore.6 It was closed to the outside world for almost 160 years.
Citing a common ancestry in Zhangzhou, in the Fujian Province of China,7 36 Peranakan merchants with surnames such as Ang, Chan and Yeo,8 got together to establish the private mutual aid organisation in 1831.
The building which served as a place to venerate their ancestors, worship the deity Sanguan Dadi,9 and conduct meetings, was completed in the late 1840s and early 1850s.10 Membership continues to be restricted to the male descendants of its founding members.11
The Keng Teck Whay brotherhood relocated to Changi in 2010 following the structure's gazette as a national monument the year before.12 The Taoist Mission (Singapore) acquired it in 2010 and oversaw an elaborate $3.8 million restoration project. The building now bears a new name â€” the Singapore Yu Huang Gong and is dedicated to the worship of the Heavenly Jade Emperor. It is open to all. While there, keep a look out for delicately crafted sculptures and carvings of dragons, fish and flowers on its roofs.
Thian Hock Keng, No. 158 Telok Ayer Street
Photographic studio G.R. Lambert & Co.'s albumen print of the Thian Hock Keng Temple (Temple of Heavenly Happiness) at Telok Ayer Street in the 1880s. Constructed between 1839 and 1842, the temple is dedicated to Mazu, a deity widely regarded as the goddess of the sea. The temple, one of the oldest places of worship in Singapore, was designated a national monument in 1973. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
After a long journey by sea, weary travellers of yesteryear were said to have made their way through Thian Hock Keng's incense-filled halls to offer thanks to Mazu, a goddess known for her ability to protect seafarers.
Likely the oldest Hokkien temple in the country, Thian Hock Keng at 158 Telok Ayer Street started life as a small shrine for Mazu. It was rebuilt between 1839 and 1842 with the donations of owners and sailors of Chinese junks at the harbour, as well as Hokkien merchants and community leaders.
Engravings of bats, in the corners of carved stone windows along the temple's facade, represent luck and prosperity.
Inside, a wooden plaque inscribed with Chinese characters which mean â€œgentle waves over the South Seasâ€ â€” a blessing for safe passage from Emperor Guangxu of Qing China â€” takes pride of place above the temple's main altar.13
Once a year, Thian Hock Keng organises a rambunctious procession known as the Excursion of Peace where a sedan chair ferrying the image of Mazu is paraded through the historic streets of Telok Ayer before proceeding to board a ferry at Marina South Pier to bless the sea.
The temple was refreshed in a major restoration exercise between 1988 and 2000, earning it an honourable mention at the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2001.
Al-Abrar Mosque, No. 192 Telok Ayer Street
The Al-Abrar Mosque which faces Mecca, was established in 1827 as a thatched hut which explains its nickname â€” kuchu palli, or hut mosque in Tamil. Between 1850 and 1855, the hut was replaced by a brick building which still stands today albeit with some modifications.14 (c1950s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Continue along the same five-foot way and you'll spot the Al-Abrar Mosque, also known as Masjid Chulia. The mosque was established as early as 1827 as a place of worship for Chulias or Tamil Muslims from the Coromandel Coast of southern India. It took the form of a thatched hut.
The mosque's Indo-Islamic design, with features such as minarets at its entrance, stands out from the rows of shophouses lining Telok Ayer. Inside, the mosque boasts European Neoclassical design elements such as Doric columns and French louvred windows.
The mosque stands as a reminder of the role Chulia immigrants played in shaping Singapore as some of the colony's early traders and money changers.
Telok Ayer Methodist Church, No. 235 Telok Ayer Street
The exterior walls of Telok Ayer Methodist Church are rather thick, having been reinforced during World War II to protect hundreds seeking refuge from bullets and shrapnel. Venture inside and you might be directed to a regular looking female toilet. During the war, it served as a storeroom with a trap door for women and girls to hide from the Japanese.
At the end of the street stands the charmingly eclectic Telok Ayer Methodist Church building, originally founded in 1889 in a shophouse clinic owned by American Methodist missionary Dr Benjamin West.15 Dr West had a heart for the Chinese community and his parishioners included patients recovering from opium addiction.16
The church moved to its present day location in 1925. To reflect the make-up of its early congregation, a Chinese-style pavilion roof was installed.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2016
Singapore has inherited a rich published heritage thanks to its history, socio-political development and strategic location at the confluence of civilisations. It was once the publishing hub in the region and a body of printed works, manuscripts and records of every description have survived through the ages. Part of this fascinating legacy was showcased in an exhibition by the National Library of Singapore, From the Stacks: Highlights of the National Library â€“ which took place from January 30 to August 28, 2016 at the National Library Gallery. The exhibition presented over 100 items drawn largely from the library's Rare Materials Collection: Publications, manuscripts, maps, documents and photographs from the 1701 to 1960. Here are some of the highlights.
Chrita Dahulu-kala, Namanya Sam Kok, Atau, Tiga Negri Ber-prang: Chan Kim Boon, Han Teow, 1892 to 1896. Singapore.
THE PRIVATE RAFFLES
Over the years, the Library has acquired a small collection of holograph letters by Stamford Raffles (1781 to 1826) and individuals related to him, which form an invaluable primary resource material for research on Singapore's early history and its modern founder. While most of the letters in the collection contain information relating to Raffles' public life and endeavours, two letters featured in the exhibition provided glimpses into his private life and character.
A letter to his cousin (with the same name) is the longest private and only autobiographical letter by Raffles. It contains a detailed account of his career progression as well as reminiscences of his humble early life. Due to family circumstances, Raffles withdrew from school when he was barely 14 and worked as a clerk with the East India Company. Despite the hardship, he persevered in self- study and mastered French and acquired knowledge in literature and science. On his learning and family poverty he recalled:
â€œThis was, however, in stolen moments, either before the office hours in the morning, or after them in the evening; and I shall never forget the mortification I felt when the penury of my family once induced my mother to complain of my extravagance in burning a candle in my room. And yet I look back to those days of misery, difficulty, and application with some degree of pleasure. I feel that I did all I could, and I have nothing to reproach myself with.â€
Letter from Raffles to Reverend Dr Thomas Raffles, At Sea October 14, 1819. | Collection of National Library, Singapore.
The letter to the same cousin by Raffles' second wife Sophia (1786 to 1858) portrays a blissful scene the Raffles family enjoyed in Bencoolen (present-day Bengkulu), Sumatra, where Stamford Raffles was the Governor-General from 1817 to 1823.
â€œOur domestic scene is so blessed and happy, I scarcely know how to describe it â€“ my dear husband's health and spirit are so bright and light and his mind so relieved from anxiety and cheered by the consciousness of having performed his duty, thus the present scene is more than usually happy â€“ my sweet children are expanding daily â€“ my little Lily is so gentle and interesting, that I am sure you would love her and I am as certain that you would love her bolder brother, because he is a miniature picture of his father in form, in face, in manners and I hope hereafter to add in mind, I have been so blessed as a mother. I ought not to regret the expectation of an additional tie next month but I could have been satisfied with the treasures I now possess and in watching them have formed sufficient occupation.â€
Close up of letter with signature of Lady Sophia Raffles to Reverend Dr Thomas Raffles, Fort Marlborough, April 8, 1820. | Collection of National Library, Singapore.
Unfortunately, such happy scenario was very short-lived as four of their five children did not survive past early childhood and died of illnesses in the next few years before Raffles and his family returned to England in 1824.
â€œMALAYANISEDâ€ LITERATURE
The Malay language has been the lingua franca of maritime Southeast Asia for centuries. Traders and travellers had to learn Malay in order to communicate with the local populations. For some early diasporic communities such as the Peranakans, they adopted the language and spoke a creolised form of Malay peppered with Hokkien words and phrases known as Baba Malay. It is thus natural to find that some early books published in Singapore were in Malay or about the Malay language. To help with learning of Malay, dictionaries and grammar books were produced. Attempts were even made to teach Malay through nursery rhymes, such as a compilation of English nursery rhymes translated into Malay and adapted to local culture. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Baba Malay translations of Chinese historical novels were very popular among the Peranakan community.
Some examples of 'Malaynised literature' were showcased in the exhibition.
â€œHAJI'S BOOK OF MALAYAN NURSERY RHYMESâ€
In this collection of popular nursery rhymes both the original English version and the Malay translations are featured. In the latter, some words were replaced with local terms to give a familiar Malayan setting, for example, â€œJack and Jillâ€ became â€œBi dan Akitâ€. The book was intended to be used for learning Malay as it includes a glossary of Malay vocabulary for the benefit of readers not proficient in the language. The book features charming illustrations depicting idyllic Malayan lifestyles in the pre-World War Two era.
Haji's book of Malayan nursery rhymes, Arthur Wedderburn Hamilton. Singapore: Printers Ltd, 1939.
Hamilton (1887 to 1967) lived in Penang where he learnt Malay and became acquainted with the local way of life. He was an officer of the Federated Malay States Police, a linguist, botanist and an author of Malay text books.
â€œHANTEOWâ€
This serialised 30-volume novel is probably the earliest Baba Malay translation of the Chinese classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms. From 1880s to 1942, translations of Chinese historical novels in Baba Malay were highly popular among the upper middle class Peranakans in Java and the Straits Settlements. They were indeed bestsellers of the day with a print run of up to 2,000 for each publication in 1930s.
Among the numerous translators of such novels in Singapore, Chan Kim Boon (1851 to 1920) was the most illustrious. A native of Penang, Chan was educated in English but received private tutoring in Chinese. He pursued further studies at the Foochow Naval School (in present-day Fuzhou) and went on to teach mathematics in that institution. He came to Singapore in 1872 to work as an administrator at law firm Aitken & Rodyk. However, he was better known for his translations of three Chinese classics: Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sam Kok), The Water Margin (Song Kang) and Journey to the West (Kou Chey Tian).

RECIPES FROM THE MELTING POT
Singapore's melting pot of cultures has produced a rich multi-ethnic culinary heritage with countless recipes passed down through the generations. Certain Singapore published cookbooks were once regarded as â€œcookery biblesâ€ and presents a myriad of sumptuous Malayan dishes.
The book contains â€œtried and testedâ€ recipes which the author compiled while living in Seremban, Malaya between 1915 and 1919. The recipes emphasise on economy due to the shortage of food and price hikes during World War I. It was written for expatriate wives who wished to cook for their households instead of relying on local cooks. When first published in 1920, it sold out in a few months.
Cover and an advertisement from The mem's own cookery book | The mem's own cookery book: 420 tried and economical recipes for Malaya, W. E. Kinsey. | Singapore : Kelly & Walsh, 1929, 3rd edition.
MY FAVOURITE RECIPES
The recipes were meant to create typical European or British fare using local ingredients. Tips on local weight measurements, food prices and names of ingredients in Malay are given. A small proportion of the recipes are on local dishes such as satai (satay), rundang (rendang), curries and gula malacca. Several dishes probably would have been rather exotic to the locals, such as sheep's brain on toast, sheep's head broth, and jugged sheep's heart.
This is the first cookbook by a Singaporean author, Ellice Handy (1902 to 1989), a Eurasian educator. First published in 1952, it contains recipes from the various communities in Malaya and catered to a cosmopolitan audience â€“ the book includes a chapter on â€œAsian Recipes that can be used in U.K., U.S.A., Australia and places where Malayan Curry Ingredients etc., are not available.â€
My favourite recipes, Ellice Handy. | Singapore: MPH, 1960.
On creating the Malayan flavour, Mrs Handy offered the following tips:
â€œIf we want a Malayan-style dish of Chinese Beehoon (Rice Noodles) or Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice) we use a paste of pounded fresh red chillies and blachan (shrimp paste) and onions, instead of or in addition to the garlic and onions.â€
â€œTo European stews we add cloves and cinnamon and to omelette we add plenty of sliced onions and chillies and just before serving a teaspoon of soy sauce. When we roast a chicken the addition of ground cinnamon, cloves and pepper, thick soy sauce and a little sugar makes it a Chinese style dish, while the addition of the â€œSatay Pasteâ€ gives it the very popular Malay Satay flavour.â€
As a culinary classic and the longest selling local cookbook, 11 editions have been printed since 1952 with the most recent one released in 2012.
There were too many publications of note in the exhibition to be highlighted in this article. The exhibits covered a wide array of topics, from politics, history, sociology, language and religion to current affairs, nature, travel, food and more. Some of the more novel items on display included an address to Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh by the Singapore Chinese merchants on the occasion of his visit in 1869; a 1901 photo album by G.R. Lambert with images of old Singapore and what is probably the first travel guidebook of Singapore, published in 1892. Visitors also saw for the first time English-Malay dictionary (1701); early nineteenth century Christian literature published by the Mission Press, the first printing press in Singapore; one of the earliest Qur'ans printed in Singapore (1869); and photographs of the war crime trials held at the Supreme Court in 1946.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2016
Technology advancement has brought about an increased popularity of emails and e-cards in place of traditional greeting cards. In today's society, Chinese New Year greeting cards are on the verge of extinction, with only seniors and some organisations keeping the practice alive. Sending Chinese New Year greeting cards is now often perceived as an old-fashioned afterthought.
Yet, an interesting trivia is that sending Chinese New Year greeting cards was the â€œinâ€ thing in Singapore in the sixties. Posting Chinese New Year greeting cards was once a popular practice, regardless of one's economic and educational background, gender or social status. The popularity of Chinese New Year greeting cards then, along with its wide audience and variety, reflects a great deal about the rich cultural history of Singapore in the sixties.
In an era without mobile phones, postal delivery was the most common channel of communication. Sending Chinese New Year greeting cards through the mail was one of the ways of showing ç¤¼ (courtesy) to one's friends. Greeting cards from that period contained beautiful poetry that conveyed well wishes for the receiver, regardless of the cards physical sizes. The usage of words such as æˆ‘ä»¬ (we) indicated a form of togetherness, mutual support and companionship in welcoming a brand new year.
Poetry featuring strong sense of companionship
There used to be spaces provided in greeting cards that allowed senders to insert their own photographs, adding a personal touch to the cards that demonstrated a deeper level of sincerity.
Photo added to give card a personal touch
More significantly, the Mandarin characters éž èº¬ (bow) were printed in all the cards, referring to the sender taking a bow to symbolise politeness and respect for the recipient.
The sending of these greeting cards was once a show of the senders' appreciation for the relationship with their recepients. During the sixties, Chinese New Year greeting cards were cheap and affordable, at about 10 cents each. Notably, the usage of typewriters or the engagement of printing service providers was common, to insert names directly and more efficiently on card printouts â€“ this signified the large numbers of New Year cards that were sent out by individuals then.
Card with name typed in
These practices suggested that there were numerous greeting cards sent by the more affluent, or those wishing to maintain a wide relationship network, which contributed to the growth of the popular practice. Through mutual exchanges of greeting cards, friendships and business relations were renewed annually. The sixties in Singapore may have been a period of rapid change with industrialisation, development of modern housing and the decline of villages, but cultural ties were maintained and we were socially tightly-knit.
The young adults of the sixties were often educated in the fifties, a period in which the percentage of students in English and Chinese streams were relatively similar: 47.4 percent in the English stream and 45.9 percent in the Chinese stream. Chinese New Year greeting cards were used by both the English- and Chinese-educated population in Singapore then, with the two different social groups sharing a common practice. While different cultures took root among local populace in the sixties, Chinese New Year greeting cards began to include English translations of Chinese poetry, indicating their common audience of Chinese and English readers.
Card containing English and Chinese version of a poem
Additionally, students who were educated in English streams were also trained in a second language through Language Exposure Time (LET) and the 1966 compulsory second language act. This meant that those who went into the English stream were still in touch with Chinese cultural practices that were already strong amongst the Chinese population. Notably, the romanisation of Chinese names spelt with Hanyu Pinyin reflected how the English-educated Chinese were sending Chinese New Year greeting cards and thus connected with Chinese culture. Common assumptions of a cultural division between the English and the Chinese-educated populace then are thus not entirely true.
Unlike present-day Chinese New Year cards, which only emphasise traditional Chinese culture, Chinese New Year greeting cards back then were a blend of traditional Chinese culture and modernity. Rich traditional Chinese culture were present in three aspects:
- Firstly, the Chinese characters in most greeting cards were in traditional Chinese, with either a right to left text vector or a writing style that starts from top to bottom, echoing traditional Chinese writing styles.
- Secondly, card pictorials included flowers, butterflies and animals such as peacocks, commonplace symbols of prosperity and longevity in traditional Chinese culture.
- Thirdly, the colours utilised in these greeting cards were warm colours such as yellow or pink, symbolising peace in traditional Chinese culture.
Traditional Chinese colours and symbols
Yet these rich traditional Chinese components were placed alongside modern elements. Chinese New Year greeting cards in the sixties often included pictures of famous Hong Kong pop stars and Mandarin pop song lyrics. The incorporation of these stars and their songs into greeting cards and their desirability as gifts indicated the popularity of these Hong Kong stars among the local population in Singapore. Modern ways of dressing, in terms of hairstyles and fashion, thus enter the society through the emulation of these popular stars.
Card featuring Hong Kong star in the 60s
Young Singaporeans of the sixties began adopting Western clothing and embracing a modern identity. This phenomenon is represented by the women in image 8, who wore Western dresses instead of traditional cheongsams. This embracement of modernity was largely influenced by the historical context of Singapore in the sixties. The export-oriented economy inevitably exposed Singapore to cultural influences from other emerging economies such as Hong Kong. Furthermore, the need for a strong workforce invited men and women to step into the working world. This empowered women to have higher purchasing power, affording them choices in asserting their modern identities through the consumption of popular music and Western clothing.
The blending of traditional and modern elements in Chinese New Year greeting cards of the sixties reflected how tradition and modernity were not at odds and often co-existed. When examined closely, Chinese New Year greeting cards that were popular in the sixties reflected the social and cultural aspects of the times that may not be known to many.
These cards reveal a dynamic society that was united in a common culture of social exchanges. Singaporeans did not compromise traditions in their acceptance of modernity; despite differences at many levels, we were undivided in maintaining a culture that embraced a modern identity alongside the remembrance of tradition.

""Gelang si paku Gelang,
Geylang si rama-rama.
Mari pulang, marilah pulang
Marilah pulang,
Bersama-sama.""
Verse from Gelang Sipaku Gelang
The verse above is from the beloved local folk song â€œGelang Sipaku Gelangâ€ and while its lyrics are not entirely definitive, the song is often associated with the Malay community's strong sense of belonging to Geylang Serai. The reason for this can be traced back to the 1890s, when the British forced the Malays and Orang Laut (Malay for â€œSea Peopleâ€) to move further inland from their original settlement at the mouth of the Singapore River.

They settled at the area now known as Geylang Serai, forming one of the oldest Malay settlements in Singapore. The area's name hints of its past as a lemongrass plantation with geylang possibly deriving from the Malay word kilang, which means a factory or press-mill, and serai referring to lemongrass. Much of the area was reclaimed from swamplands to build the foundations for the Geylang Serai we recognize today.

While Geylang Serai was largely known as a Malay enclave earlier, the increasing population of the small island nation and the departure of the British blurred physical boundaries and created more porous communities. People of different religions and cultures learnt to live in harmony with each other.

Lee Hong Ping was born and bred within this united climate. His fondest memories are of the Lorong 40 Geylang playground next to the Geylang River, where he and family members would play at for over a decade, sharing walks around it and attending the many community events nearby, such as cultural performances and carnivals.

Lee gained a deeper understanding of the rich history and culture of the over 120 clans, associations and organisations in Geylang Serai when he became a member of the Geylang Serai Inter-Racial Religious Confidence Circle (IRCC). Hoping to share the heritage of the area with a wider audience, Lee championed a multi-year project to develop the Geylang Serai Foot and Food Heritage Trails.
Organised by the Integration and Naturalisation Champions (INC) Committee and supported by the National Heritage Board, these heritage trails showcase what Lee described as â€œthe variety and diversity of Geylang Serai [that truly mirror] the multi-racial, multi-cultural Singaporeâ€. Every trail site was selected carefully, taking into account a myriad of factors. At the core of each chosen site was the strength of its story â€“ its history, founding values, objectives and the organisation's faithfulness to its mission. The architectural conditions at these sites were also considered for driving the trail experience.

The work on the trails culminated in the creation of a guide map, allowing one to have an insider's perspective of Geylang Serai. Marked with over 20 sites, the trails weave through numerous lorongs (Malay for road) and give a glimpse into the lives of its residents. Important places of worship and architectural remnants from a bygone era are brought to light on the guide map. A trail-walker will see rows of iconic shophouses line lorongs on either side, their ceramic tiles and colourful faÃ§ades adorning the shops. Walking towards the entrance of the former Queen's theatre, one can almost picture mid-nineteenth century residents hurrying in the light of ornate street lamps as they flocked to the foyer of the once-bustling cinema.

Places of worship are situated throughout the trail. Soon Thian Keing, the oldest Chinese Temple in Singapore, was established during the Qing dynasty and stands just metres away from the prayer halls of the Khadijah Mosque.

This is testament to the peaceful relationship between the diverse religious groups. Another reflection of the community spirit and understanding was the reaction to a fire in February 2011: It broke out at Chong Hood Lim Association, a Buddhist temple, and had badly affected the neighbouring Coronation Baptist Church. Upon learning that the church was unable to conduct service sessions, the temple association offered to let the church conduct temporary services at one of their newly-acquired activity centres.
No less important are the beloved food haunts on the trail, where one can spot locals gathering and sharing culturally-diverse meals. From enjoying a durian feast with friends and family at the â€œ five-foot wayâ€ along the stalls, to savouring soft and fluffy putu piring (Malay sweet snack) at the renowned Haig Road Centre â€“ the simple pleasures in life remain unchanged from the past.
Since its launch in April, the Geylang Serai Foot and Food Heritage Trails have revealed to many the fascinating and unique story of a former kampong. Amidst the rapid development of our urban landscape, Lee hopes that others can also experience Geylang Serai â€œ[in] its current charm and characteristics [and] see very diverse clans, groups and religious organisations like churches, temples and mosques remaining true to their roots, retaining their rich cultures and heritage, while continuing to co-exist harmoniously as good neighbours next to one anotherâ€.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Jyoti-Ramesh-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"A permanent exhibition at the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) is titled â€œIndians In Singapore â€” Past and Presentâ€. Talking about it to groups of visitors to the IHC may be daunting at times. But, 49-year-old Jyoti Ramesh sees it as part of learning about, living and transmitting history. All of these have been happening for her as a docent at IHC for the past 4 years.
Learning on the job
As Jyoti went through the months of rigorous training with Friends of the Museums (FOM), she understood the docent's ideals of being â€œengaging and informativeâ€. Jyoti is quick to add that she is by no means a repository of all IHC information either.
There are times when a challenging question is thrown at her like a curveball. She remembers a visitor asking why David Marshall was not featured at the IHC. Jyoti's response was first to ask the lady what prompted the question and secondly to do extensive research and reading in her own free time. She found that, indeed, David Marshall did have some family connections in India. They were Baghdadi Jews from Iraq. If the question crops up again, Jyoti will be better prepared to talk about it. For docents, the learning journey never ceases.
As a docent, Jyoti feels connected to Singapore â€” both the new and the old. She says that when you join a heritage institution like the IHC, â€œyou will then understand the struggles of migrant communities.â€ This, she feels, is vital for those who arrive on Singapore's shores as expatriates and who are initially not connected with the community. Volunteering as a docent can help turn that situation around. â€œI don't stop learning. I don't stop making the connectionsâ€¦ I look at it (history) with different eyes,â€ says Jyoti.
Constantly connecting
Jyoti feels she had an advantage in adjusting to Singapore when she first came here. She speaks Tamil. So, as a docent, when Tamils share their stories of Singapore with her, she is able to encourage them to elaborate. These conversations become part of her own learning journey.
She walks the talk, sometimes literally. Jyoti has been known to go to Abdul Rahim's shop on Upper Dickson Road to tell him that a photograph displayed at the IHC looked like that of his shop from days of old. She persuaded the two brothers to visit IHC. Such neighbourhood connections matter as they inspire storytelling about how early migrants arrived by ship in Singapore on board the S.S Rajula, the State of Madras or the MV Chidambaram.
The conversations with visitors to the IHC and on the Indian Heritage trail are what drive Jyoti to keep learning about the artefacts as she connects the past, present, and future for Singaporeans and tourists alike.
â€œIt starts with the history back some 2,000 years ago, but it continues to how migrants brought with them their culture, and why they came and what it has done to Singapore as we see it today,â€ says Jyoti. And, as classes of school children visit the IHC week after week, Jyoti feels she is helping the modern-day Indian Singaporean child to connect and think about their heritage here.
A love for sharing history
Jyoti was from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, and has a basic degree in Economics and an MBA (Finance) as well. She has worked not only in New Delhi but also in London and Hong Kong before moving to Singapore in 2007. As she is winding down her own business, she is immersing herself far more in the world of a docent. For her, it has been a natural progression as her two children have become older.
Jyoti says, â€œI love sharing connections. I love connecting the past with the present, and across countries in the past. I love connecting kids to their past, and telling them how relevant it still is.â€ It should come as no surprise that this docent's mother was also her History and Civics teacher in school. She laughs and admits that she did not love history at that time as it meant mugging, exams, and homework. But, because her father was a Railway Officer, her family lived in some of the most historical cities in various parts of India. You might start to wonder whether a love for sharing history has somehow seeped into her DNA.

Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2012
MONUMENTAL WEDDINGS presented a collection of about 150 archival and contemporary wedding photographs taken at 32 of Singapore's national monuments from the early 20th century to the present. These fascinating and unique images capture more than just couples on their wedding day and their love stories - they also feature historic buildings which have earned a permanent position in the landscape of Singapore as preserved monuments. Taken at these monuments, the photographs have become artefacts that reveal not only changes in wedding fashions, venues and photography, but also certain sociological and cultural trends and developments.
Broadly organised into five main segments, the exhibition highlighted the characteristics of Early Wedding Photography in Singapore and the popularity of monuments as wedding venues; the origins and evolution of Mass Weddings on the island; the Ties that Bind monuments, communities and families together; and the distinct architectural features of the national monuments that serve as Monumental Backdrops for wedding photos. Monumental Love Stories, four short films shot on location at the monuments, rounded off the exhibition by giving visitors the opportunity to see heart-warming couples on-screen as they relate stories of their deep-felt commitment and love, while a fifth film provided an industry-insider's take on the history and development of wedding photography in Singapore.
The Early Beginnings of Wedding Photography in Singapore
Wedding Photography â€“ Studio and Wedding Day
Wedding photography in Singapore before the second half of the 20th century consisted mostly of formal, posed indoor studio shots of the bride and bridegroom.
Actual day wedding pictures taken at the venue of the solemnisation or wedding reception were less common. Posed or candid, this was an option primarily for the privileged or prominent members of society who had the means to commission a photographer for the event itself.
A wide variety of locations could serve as the venue for a couple's solemnisation ceremony or wedding reception, even in the early days. All couples featured in this exhibition, however, shared one thing in common: their weddings and/or wedding receptions were held at buildings, institutions and places that have now been recognised as historical treasures and gazetted as national monuments.
Monuments as Wedding Witnesses: Places of Worship
In early Singapore, religious places of worship took on an important role as sites of social interaction and fellowship for newcomers to the island.
Religious buildings also served another important function. They were venues of choice to mark one of the most significant moments of their members' lives: their weddings. Families, together with the immediate community, would gather in these buildings to witness wedding customs and rituals being carried out and to give their blessings to the newly wedded couples.
Fashionable Affairs: Hotels and Commercial Venues
From notices and announcements published in local newspapers, it could be gathered that the custom of holding one's wedding reception at hotels such as Raffles Hotel and Goodwood Park Hotel started in Singapore in the early 1900s, and was especially popular amongst the expatriate community.

Notable personalities such as former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and his wife, Madam Kwa Geok Choo, held their wedding reception at the Raffles Hotel.
Another popular venue was the Former Victoria Theatre and Memorial Hall (today's Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall), which played host to wedding receptions of various ethnicities from the late 1930s to the late 1940s.
Institutions of Learning (and Weddings!)
In the early 20th century, the Peranakan Chinese community in Singapore publicly engaged in a discussion on the need to reform expensive and heavily ritualised Chinese wedding ceremonies. The view that traditional Chinese weddings were old-fashioned, and â€˜modern' forward-thinking Chinese should cast them off in favour of simplified â€˜reformed' weddings, was taken up by certain prominent members of the Chinese society.
Towards the 1920s and 1930s, such â€˜reformed' weddings were increasingly held at institutions of education and learning such as schools and libraries.
The concept of â€˜modern' education had taken root in Singapore and Mandarin began to replace Chinese dialects as the main medium of instruction in the 1900s. By 1939, there were 30,000 students enrolled in Chinese-language schools on the island. A popular motto during the 1920s and 1930s was: â€œWithout Chinese education there can be no overseas Chineseâ€. It was thus no coincidence that the same period saw numerous Chinese couples choosing to take photos in front of institutions of Chinese learning. It was their way of expressing their Chinese identity and aligning themselves with the values that modern schools such as Tao Nan exemplified. Tao Nan stood out as one of the first â€˜new style' Chinese primary schools. Opened in the early 1900s, it promoted Chinese culture and values, which differed from 19th-century privately funded schools that had no fixed curriculum.

Mass Weddings at Monuments
The Move towards Mass Marriages
â€œMass marriages are very wise in cases where the parties are not very wealthy... They are economical and convenient and it means young couples being able to begin their married life without making heavy expenditure. Mass marriages are customary in China but these are the first to be held in Singapore.â€
â€“ Kao Ling Pai (Singapore Chinese Consul-General), â€œTen Couples Wed at Great Worldâ€, The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884 - 1942), 1 February 1937.
The first mass wedding ever held in Singapore took place at the Great World Amusement Park in 1937. The phenomenon of mass weddings in Singapore had its intellectual and ideological roots in Chiang Kai-Shek's New Life Movement, which was launched to halt the perceived material and spiritual â€˜degeneration' of the Chinese people. The reform movement emphasised (among other things) simplicity and frugality; traditional Chinese weddings, regarded as costly and extravagant, became a target of this reform.
Marrying En Masse: â€œAffordable Pomp and Ceremonyâ€ (1940s - 1960s)
The outbreak of World War Two and the ensuing Japanese Occupation put a temporary halt to mass weddings in Singapore. The practice restarted with much fanfare in the late 1940s as organisations such as the Mayfair Musical and Dramatic Association, the Chinese YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association) and Chinese clan associations including the Khek Community Guild and the Hokkien Huay Kuan took the lead in initiating and promoting mass weddings. Although such ceremonies were no longer associated with the New Life Movement, mass weddings nevertheless prevailed because the essence remained unchanged: it saved money.

Dramatically Different Demographics
Besides reasons of economy, mass weddings took off in the two decades after the war also because of the dramatic demographic changes on the island during that period. A distinctive feature of 19th-century Singapore was the huge disparity in its number of men and women, especially among the immigrant Chinese and Indian populations. By 1947, however, the imbalance in the Chinese community was much reduced with a ratio of 1,132 men to 1,000 women. With the numbers of Chinese men and women almost at par, opportunities to find a marital partner were much increased.
Between 1956 and 1960, the Hokkien Huay Kuan alone held a total of 17 mass weddings. The first involvement of the clan association in its members' weddings began with Tan Kim Ching, who took the lead to officiate weddings of Chinese couples during his tenure as president of the Hokkien Huay Kuan in the mid-19th century.
In 1969, Radio and Television Singapura organised a mass wedding ceremony at the Singapore Conference Hall as a publicity event for distribution and broadcasting overseas. It was the first of its kind and a precursor to the way mass weddings were marketed in the following two decades.
The first televised mass wedding in Singapore held at the Former Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House (Singapore Conference Hall today), 1969.

Marketing the Mass Wedding (1970s - 1980s)
â€œImagine a wedding with more than a thousand guests, followed by a dream holiday abroad â€“ for which you pay a mere $3,000.â€ â€“ â€œI do... and so do weâ€, The Straits Times, 3 April 1988.
The trend of mass weddings in Singapore continued in the 1970s and 1980s, although the driving force behind such events were by then tour operators and travel agencies such as Singapore Cultural and Entertainment Tours, Oxley Tours and Sino-America Tours. These operators often co-opted other relevant parties including the Social Development Section (SDS) and Singapore Airlines.
Mass weddings were packaged with honeymoon trips to attract a new set of consumers. Held at the Neptune Theatre Restaurant, Shangri-La Hotel and even the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, these mass weddings were marketed as romantic and convenient alternatives, with the added advantage of a honeymoon abroad at affordable prices.
""Mass wedding couples have a 'rail' good time"" (at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station) published in The Straits Times on 18 September 1989, p. 17. The Tanjong Pagar Railway Station was gazetted a National Monument in April 2011.

Mass Weddings
Revived (2000s)
By the 1990s, mass weddings had largely disappeared from Singapore as a result of a vastly different socio-economic environment. Personalised, customised and individualistic weddings became the norm. Nevertheless, in recent years, mass weddings have seen a surprising revival in Singapore. Mostly held on unusual or â€˜auspicious' dates, these mass weddings are now unique rarities organised for a variety of reasons. For example, the 2008 mass wedding organised by the Hokkien Huay Kuan was an effort to highlight the history and involvement of the clan association in the practice of mass weddings in Singapore. In the same year, the Sultan Mosque Malay mass wedding was held to foster closer links between families and the com- munity. In addition, the Botanic Gardens held a mass wedding for 150 couples on the â€˜special' date of 20 September 2009 (or 20.09.2009) to celebrate its 150th anniversary, while the People's Association Family Life Section, in collaboration with Lianhe Zaobao and Sentosa Leisure Group, organised a mass wedding on 10 October 2010 (or 10.10.2010) to encourage more Singaporean couples to wed.
The Ties that Bind
Religious monuments in Singapore have been featured as backdrops in wedding photographs ever since wedding photography emerged from indoor studios to the outdoors. Many of these religious monuments were established in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the diverse ethnic backgrounds of migrants resulted in the construction of churches, temples, mosques, synagogues and other religious buildings. Besides serving as places of worship, these buildings also supported networks and welfare organisations that sheltered migrants, provided financial aid and helped to improve the lives of their communities. Naturally, these prayer halls and sanctuaries have over the years witnessed countless wedding solemnisations and played host to numerous wedding receptions, thus securing the religious monuments' place in their worshippers' treasured wedding albums.

A Part of the Family â€“ Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple
For Chandra, the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple has a towering presence in his family history and childhood. His grandfather, P. Govindasamy Pillay, who established the PGP stores which sold sundries, spices and textiles, was the founder-member of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Pillay contributed generously to the temple, especially to the building of the five-tiered gopuram or entrance tower completed in 1979. Realising that the Hindu community needed a communal space for wedding ceremonies and celebrations, Pillay also funded the building of the wedding hall, where Chandra's family and members of the Indian community have since held their weddings.
As a child, the temple served as a playground to Chandra and his siblings. He fondly remembers his mother taking them around the temple, sharing its stories and its various sculptures, paintings and decorative features.
Chandra now resides in the United Kingdom with his wife, Gail. When the couple decided to get married, they chose to return to Singapore to hold a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple. The temple remains a focal point for Chandra's family as they continue to actively worship and participate in the various festivals and activities held at the temple.
â€œNow that I'm living in the UK, it's really important to reconnect with the community in general when I come for my very short visits and the temple facilitates that. We come here in the evening and we're pretty sure that some of my relatives, friends are going to be here after work for prayers as well.â€
â€“ Chandra.

Since it was first built in 1855 as a simple brick building with a main hall, the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple has been an important religious centre for the Indian community in Serangoon â€“ an area with a large concentration of Indian-run brick kilns and cattle farms in the 19th century that attracted numerous Indian migrant workers.
Gazetted as a national monument in 1978, the temple remains a focal point for the celebration of key Hindu festivals such as Brahmotsavan, Deepavali and Thaipusam.
Four Weddings and a Monument - Maghain Aboth Synagogue
Justin and Joelle were married on 20 March 2011 at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue. The synagogue has been an important witness to the weddings of four generations in Joelle's family. Her great-grandmother, grandmother and mother all exchanged their vows under the cloth canopy in the synagogue. This canopy or covering, known as the chuppah, is a symbol of the home the couple will build together. Many couples from the tight-knit Jewish community were also married under it. Joelle's family continues to worship at this synagogue and Joelle's father, Victor Sassoon, is President of the Jewish Welfare Board. Their family actively contributes to this monument and the Jewish community.
â€œThe Maghain Aboth Synagogue is a place for communal activities and prayer for our Jewish community. It is the longest standing structure in our community, and the first place that brings the community together on a regular basis. The synagogue gives our community a sense of belonging and permanence and we hope that this will continue to be clearly communicated for future generations.â€
â€“ Joelle
The Maghain Aboth Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in Southeast Asia, was established in 1878 to serve a growing Jewish population in Singapore.

Today, the synagogue continues to play an important role in the communal life of the local Jewish community, who gather at the synagogue to celebrate weddings and participate in religious festivals such as Yom Kippur and Simchat Torah.
A Call to Prayer and Love - Sultan Mosque
Shah and Syahidah's paths were destined to cross. They were both regular worshippers at the Sultan Mosque when they met at the Raffles Hotel where they worked.
Shah attended Friday prayers at the mosque where his mother was also a regular worshipper.
Syahidah went for prayers at the mosque, which has been an integral part of her life since she was a child. Her grand-mother, who came to Singapore from Indonesia, settled in Kampong Glam where she first began attending the mosque. It was to the mosque that her grandmother fled when the Maria Hertogh riots erupted. Two generations on, Syahidah's family continues to worship at the mosque.

Today, the couple continues to frequent the mosque which remains the centre of their spiritual life, and they hope to bring their newborn daughter there as well.
Sultan Mosque took its name from Sultan Hussein (appointed by Sir Stamford Raffles as the Sultan of Singapore), who requested that a mosque be built near his Istana in Kampong Glam. The original mosque was a single-storey brick building with a double-tiered roof completed in 1826. The current mosque, designed by Swan and MacLaren, was completed in 1928 with its distinctive golden domes. Sultan Mosque continues to be an important centre of religious, cultural and social activities for Muslims.

Monumental Backdrops
Rising sentiments have surged in recent years towards Singapore's past. A wave of nostalgia has swept the nation, perhaps triggered by the pace of urban renewal. Singapore's zest for modernisation and development led to a period of intense urban renewal, starting from the 1960s. As more and more buildings fell to the wrecking ball, familiar landscapes began to vanish, igniting public discussions on the emotional ties and social memories that places and buildings evoke as markers of identity and history; and consequently, the need for preservation and conservation.
With heritage at the forefront of public consciousness, â€˜vintage' has become fashionable and trendy. As buildings of great historical, architectural, social and cultural significance, Singapore's national monuments have seen a surge in popularity among couples caught up in this wave of nostalgia and in search of something unique and special for their wedding albums. Mostly designed and constructed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, these monuments often feature beautiful architectural elements such as sweeping staircases, intricate carvings and sculptures, towering classic columns, steeples and minarets, and majestic domes. Their distinctive faÃ§ades and use of geometric shapes and sharp clean lines serve as beautiful and unique backdrops against which wedding couples are framed, injecting a sense of elegance and grandeur into their photos. Furthermore, as historic buildings that have withstood the test of time, these monuments convey a feeling of timelessness, lending gravitas to the wedding pictures and highlighting what couples aspire for their marriages.
These wedding photographs showcase archetypal wedding pictures taken at popular national monuments with interesting stories of the monuments as well as the couples' journey into marriage. They were contributed by couples who shared their stories and by photographers who shared their work.
Raffles Hotel
Did you know?
The main building of the Raffles Hotel was designed by Regent Alfred John Bidwell, a graduate of London's Architectural Association and a member of architectural firm, Swan and MacLaren. It was opened with great fanfare on 18 November 1899 and introduced innovations such as electrical lights and fans. Its magnificent faÃ§ade of louvre, fanlight-arched windows facing the seafront greeted visitors en route to other destinations as well as globetrotters on around-the-world cruises made popular by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.
St Joseph's Church
Before they were an item, Jordan invited Candice to attend mass with him in St Joseph's Church. Candice immediately felt a special connection to the church and was eventually baptised into the Catholic faith. They are one of the few rare couples who married at the church as it ceased to be a parish with an active congregation in 1999. St Joseph's Church continues to be a focal point in the couple's lives as they and their families still faithfully serve and worship there.

The north wall of St George's Church is dominated by a simple but starkly beautiful pattern of arched windows, with the largest central window highlighted by four circular windows on top with brick detailing. The church is named after St George, the patron saint of England. Legend has it that there was a dragon plaguing the city of Silene in Libya, demanding the sacrifice of young women. A knight by the name of St George fought and killed the dragon, an act he attributed to the power of the Christian God. In doing so, St George became the driving force behind the conversion of people to Christianity.

â€œParking was free, dining was alfresco, and we could admire each others' steeds in between bites. What better way to fall in love?â€
Did you know?
The Tanjong Pagar Railway Station and its tracks stood on land that belonged to Malaysia until recently. The Singapore Railway Transfer Ordinance of 1918, enacted when Singapore and Malaysia were still British colonies, had mandated that the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station (as well as the Bukit Timah Railway Station) be transferred to the Federated Malay States Government. The station was gazetted a national monument in April 2011.

In a land where the mystical and natural meet, nothing seems extraordinary. Masks take on supernatural powers and lizards grow big enough to swallow a goat without much effort. This is Indonesia or â€œIslands of the Indiesâ€, a vast archipelago located at the crossroads of the traditional spice route between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
Land of Dance and Dragon was a discovery of Indonesia through its dances. This exhibition at the Singapore Philatelic Museum explored one of the greatest demonstrations of skill, art devotion and culture â€“ the living tradition of dance. To portray characters and animals, performers don masks and elaborate costumes to narrate anecdotes of history, epic tales as well as current affairs. What started as a ritual performed for the gods to ask for protection against calamity still survives today. The dances, masks and costumes are diverse and varied but the quest for a peaceful life is common throughout the length of the archipelago.

With a total land area of 1,919,317 square kilometres, Indonesia spans the equator between continental Asia and Australia and consists of over 13,000 islands, of which only 6,000 are inhabited. There are five main islands â€“ Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya â€“ and two smaller archipelagos: Nusa Tenggara and the Maluku Islands.

The country has over 240 million people speaking many regional languages and dialects and practising many of the world's major religions. Trade thrived in this region as early as the seventh century. During the rule of the Srivijayan (CE 700 â€“ 1300) and later Majapahit (CE 1293 â€“ 1500) empires, Indonesia traded with China and India. Through the same channels, Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced. Around 13th century, Islam arrived with Arab traders. European countries fought among themselves for control of the spice islands of Maluku. Dutch colonial powers (CE 1602 â€“ 1942) then ruled Indonesia for three and a half centuries till after World War II.
Indonesia displays an amazing array of cultural forms. It has been said that in Indonesia â€“ art and life are intertwined. To observe the formal study of dance is to understand the history and culture of the country: its music, religion, literature, sculpture and architecture. Indonesian culture is a rich blend of heritage, living tradition and modern art. Monuments provide the built heritage. Traditional theatres of shadow puppets or human actors form the living tradition, and contemporary painting, sculpture, drama and dance inject modernism.
Dance â€“ A Living Tradition
Dance in Indonesia serves as more than entertainment and recreation. Many dances have a religious significance. They are performed to honour ancestors, in traditional ceremonies like weddings, births and deaths as well as yearly activities like harvesting. There are as many dances as there are provinces in the country. Within each province, there are many types and variations of dances. Although the dances mentioned here are but a small selection, their importance to the fabric of society cannot be denied.
Traditional ceremonial dances are still practised in Bali especially during the Galungan and Kuningan festivals. Galungan is a Balinese holiday that occurs every 210 days and lasts for 10 days, whereas Kuningan is the last day of the holiday. During this time, the Balinese gods are believed to visit the Earth. In Kalimantan, the Dayak people perform the tari mandau (sabre dance) which mimics the trailblazing action of clearing the forest. This dance which symbolises the fighting spirit of the people are performed during special ceremonial days. The Sanghyang trance dance is presented in Bali to ward off evil spirits. Java has a similar trance dance called Kuda Kepang.

Origin of Dance in Indonesia
It has been said that before the introduction of formal religion, the gods had powerful influence over the land and people of Indonesia. To induce the gods to answer their prayers, sovereigns proffered fresh flowers and fragrant incense. But the most refined offering is the gift of dance. Indonesian dances can be divided into three broad types: traditional religious dances, dramatised dances, folk and modern dances. Traditional religious dances are based on the belief that the dance would help people make contact with the gods, provide meaning to life or instill a force into things such as crops, fertility or war.
Gambuh is considered the oldest form of dance drama and the source for other dramatic dances. It was performed in the Javanese courts of the Majapahit kingdom and belongs to the semi-sacred or ceremonial group. The stories are usually drawn from the lives of the kings of East Java, very often from the Panji stories. Panji was a prince famed for his search for his beloved Princess Candra Kirana.
For about 100 years during Dutch colonial rule, dance lost its importance. After the country gained independence, a desire to express a sense of freedom and democracy prompted the revival of folk and regional dances. Society dances such as the ronggeng of West Java, the handkerchief dance and umbrella dance of the Bugis are primarily for entertainment and have no religious significance. On the other hand, the mask dance is one of the oldest traditions in Indonesian art and exists in almost every region. Many evolved from religious customs and rituals while others are purely for artistic pursuit.
Dances of Java
Yogyakarta and Surakarta, where the kraton (palaces) are located, are famous for the refined and graceful Javanese dances. There are several groups of dances from this region: the Wayang dances originally intended for ritual ceremonies; the sacred Bedojo and Srimpi court dances; the Beksan or War dance; and the dances of the villages.
The word â€˜wayang' means shadow. Originally wayang was performed by the head of the family to ask the spirits for guidance for important events like marriage and birth. With family members as witnesses, spirits were said to appear as shadows. Nowadays, current events, rules of behaviour and education form the basis of wayang stories. The different types of wayang include Wayang Kulit (leather puppet) Wayang Klitik (flat wooden puppet), Wayang Golek (wooden puppets) and the non-puppet ones of Wayang Beber (which use paper parchment as a backdrop) and Wayang Wong (human masked dances). The wayang stories are usually based on the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics.

Stamps: Wayang Golek and Wayang Kulit on stamps
Wayang kulit is a shadow puppet performance and is an integral part of temple festivals. The puppets are made of flat dried buffalo hide. The performance area has a screen and a light (an oil lamp in older days) and in front of the screen sits the Dalang or puppeteer, who conducts and plays the entire wayang. In front of him lie banana tree stems where the puppets are stuck when not in use; bad characters on the left and good ones on the right. At the start and end of the performance, the dalang will place the gunungan in front of the screen. The stage represents life on earth. The dalang symbolises God, the screen is the universe and the banana trunk where the puppets rest is earth. Hinduism first arrived in Indonesia followed closely by Buddhism in the early centuries. The Hindu influence is evident in the shadow puppet stories with themes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana.
The Gunungan or Kayon is used to start and end the play, as well as change one scene to another. It represents the Tree of Life and the unity of the cosmic order. Two gatekeepers stand on both sides of the door to the spiritual temple. There are many versions of the gunungan depending on the local culture and social situation. Javanese gunungan have more symbols compared to those from Bali.
Bedojo, began within the walls of the courts of Jogjakarta to mark ceremonies like the sultan's birthday and special anniversaries. It is performed by girls from the aristocracy. The Bedojo is a slow and deliberate dance performed by nine girls with faces made up like a traditional Javanese bride. On their heads they wear a diadem with a white bird feather. The Srimpi is similar to the Bedojo but less grand and performed by four women. Beksan or War dances are performed by pairs of men and women who retell the stories from some segments of Javanese literature. Away from the courts in the villages, people perform dances such as Ronggeng, Djoged, Handkerchief Dance, Reog and Kuda Lumping, some as courtship dances and others as celebratory dances.

Dances of Bali
Music and dance are integral to religious ceremonies and social activity of Balinese life. This island has one of the most intriguing selections of dances. In areas where people practise Buddhism and the Bali-Hindu faith, spirits are often summoned to enter living humans and puppets. This is especially evident in the Sanghyang and Barong dances. The Sanghyang is a trance dance ritual where pre-adolescent girls perform under a hypnotic influence. This dance is performed to ward off disasters or epidemics.
Kecak is probably the most recognisable Balinese dance. With an all-male chorus chanting â€œcak, cak, cakâ€ in overlapping sequence, the effect is both hypnotic and mystifying. The Kecak is a vocal chant originating from the Sanghyang dance. The Rejang is a sacred dance performed in the inner court of the temple during offerings and celebrations. It is a group dance by pre-adolescent girls, unmarried or older women. They are said to be heavenly maidens who have come to earth.1 The male equivalent is the Baris Gede or warrior dance.

Balinese mask dances have existed for over a century. Like the older types of dances, mask dances were used to drive out evil spirits that could cause havoc to crops. Prayers are said at every step of the mask preparation, from the selection of the tree to the performance. Bali's Topeng dance-drama often portrays stories based on the lives of the Balinese kings. Early masks have mouthpieces which the actor bites to hold the mask in place. Today, the masks are tied to the face.
Topeng Pajegan is a monodrama as all the roles are portrayed by one dancer. The stories are usually derived from the chronicles of the kings. Depending on the occasion: wedding, tooth-filing ceremony2 or birth, the performer will choose the story most appropriate for the occasion. The characters appear in a fairly typical sequence. The Patih, a minister of strong character with a red face indicating bravery is first to appear. He is usually followed by a coarse brown face Patih and then a wise old man (Topeng Tua).
The last character to appear is Sidhakarya3. After he gives offerings and prayers to the gods he immediately gives chase to the children in the audience. When he catches a child, he carries him to the shrine and holds him up to the gods. The child is then released and rewarded with a small gift of Chinese coins, as a symbol of prosperity. In current times, the Sidhakarya segment does not happen very often.
The Topeng Panca is performed by five dancers during temple festivals. The full mask characters such as the king and ministers do not speak but deliver their ideas through elegant and graceful movements. Half-masked characters like the clown servants tell the stories.
The Barong is a mythological creature that performs stories that are entwined with black magic and some form of trance. With its big eyes, clacking mouth and furry body, it patrols the village streets clearing away dark forces that bring harm to the land and people. Rangda with her fearful mask is the witch-widow and Queen of Black Magic. She is portrayed with a long hanging tongue, fangs and long hair. In the magical Calonarang dance, the Barong and Rangda characters are pitched against each other in a classic battle between the good and evil.
The creation of wayang wong was initiated by Dalem Gede Kusamba, ruler of Klungkung from 1772-1825. He commissioned a new dance based on the Ramayana epic using a collection of royal masks. Following the wayang kulit style, wayang wong was created with human performers instead of puppets. Wayang wong is performed during the holy days of Galungan and Kuningan. As the masks are sacred, they are kept in the temple and are blessed before and after use.
Dances of Sumatra and other Islands
In Sumatra, the influence and presence of ancient dances are less evident because the faster paced and social dances are favoured. There are fewer Ramayana and Mahabharata themed dances except around the areas of Batak and South Sumatra. Dances which originated from the worship of the various gods are still performed although the region's prevailing customary law (adat) and religion now cast an overriding influence.

Dance and the Dragon
The huge Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) lives in a hostile environment with little food and water. It overcame all these challenges and remained fairly untouched by evolution and the Ice Age. The existence of the Komodo dragon is proof of its tenacity.
The prehistoric-looking reptile serves as a perfect foil to the refined dance. The reptile's appearance is beastly, it walks with an awkward gait and displays an amazing instinctive power when it attacks. The dance on the other hand has graceful and refined movements and the technique is acquired through many years of strict training. The Komodo dragon commands respect in its environment and the dance pays reverence to the gods. Although the elegant dance and the awkward Komodo dragon seem worlds apart, there is an interesting link between them. Note the posture of the dancers â€“ the limbs, body, neck and head â€“ with many movements involving raised elbows, and angled torso. Observe the Komodo dragon's swagger, every step taken with limbs at an angle. Is it pure coincidence or a case of art imitating nature?
A â€˜fire-breathing' Dragon
The fire-breathing dragons as told by ancient mariners who visited the Spice Islands are in reality Komodo Dragons. They are the largest living species of lizard. These venomous lizards can grow to a length of two to three metres weighing about 150 kilograms. Komodo National Park is located at the Lesser Sunda Islands which covers the larger islands of Komodo, Rinca and Pada. Founded in 1980, the national park is also a popular location for scuba diving as the marine biodiversity includes whale sharks, manta rays, pygmy seahorses, sponges and corals.

  ""... [W]e cannot depend on other people -- white man, black man, yellow man, whoever it might be -- to look after us; we must look after ourselves. You see, this is our country and we've got to rule ourselves.""
- Gerald De Cruz, Organising Secretary of the Malayan Democratic Union (MDU),
Singapore's First Political Party Formed in 1945, in an Oral History Interview, September 1981
In sharing the political vision he once held for post-war Singapore, Gerald De Cruz captured the prevailing mood among an emerging class of young leaders who were determined to rid Singapore of colonial rule after the British returned at the end of the Japanese Occupation. This marked the awakening of a political consciousness among the masses in Singapore that led to the determined struggle for decolonization and self-rule -- the part of the national narrative most Singaporeans today are familiar with. Lesser known perhaps, but equally important to Singapore's post-war history, were the men-on-the-street whose lives and stories during this period played a part in shaping Singapore's quest to build a national identity as it journeyed towards nationhood.
A collaboration between the National Archives of Singapore and the National Museum of Singapore, 45-65: Liberation, Unrest... a New Nation traced Singapore's post-war history from 1945 to 1965 through six different themes. Using selected artefacts and a range of archival materials such as photographs, oral history interviews, as well as historical documents and footage, 45-65 provided an objective perspective of everyday life in Singapore in the two decades leading up to independence. Just as it illustrated the hardships and challenges faced by the people of Singapore during this tumultuous period, the exhibition offered a glimpse of the cultural dynamism that was prevalent then, thus giving Singaporeans and other visitors today an opportunity to look at how the nation was formed.
Theme 1: Post-war Singapore
Although there was widespread jubilation following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the sense of triumph was soon replaced by a sobering atmosphere as Singapore's immediate post-war years were marked by pressing social and welfare needs. Living conditions were abysmal as the problems of overcrowding continued after the war, forcing families to live in crammed and filthy slums and squatters that had poor ventilation and lacked proper sanitation. Severe shortages of food and healthcare plagued the population, which was also threatened by outbreaks of fire and diseases due to the poor living conditions and overcrowded situation.

Yet, in spite of these challenges, this period saw the brewing of an early national consciousness, shaped by the voluntary spirit of locals who rallied to provide welfare support on the ground for a common social cause. The Social Welfare Department (SWD), for example, started a chain of popular ""People's Kitchen"" in 1946 that offered affordable but nutritious meals to the needy.

A similar programme, the Children's Feeding Scheme, was established in 1947, where the SWD supplied free meals to malnourished children. In the face of urgent healthcare needs, and as the colonial administration attempted to curb the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera and small pox, volunteers also offered their help in providing free healthcare services including mass immunisations and x-ray screenings for the people.

Theme II: Stirrings of Discomfort
With the image of the all-powerful Western imperialists shattered in World War Two, the widespread social and welfare problems in post-war Singapore soon became sources of discontent that fuelled the spread of political agitation against the colonial government. Different groups within the local population tapped on the ongoing issues of food shortages, unemployment and poor living conditions, many workers participated in strikes instigated by the communist-influenced trade unions, as illustrated by the Hock Lee Bus riots in 1955.
Trade union activism at the that time also saw active participation by students from Chinese-medium schools, whose grievances against the colonial government centred on the relative lack of job opportunities and government aid compared to students from other language-medium schools. Prior to the Hock Lee Bus riots - during which they, too, joined the pickets - the Chinese middle school1 students had organized their own demonstrations to protest against the National Service Ordinance which took effect in 1954, seeing military conscription as a form of colonial oppression that would disrupt their studies.

They were protesting against the detention of four student leaders and expulsion of 142 students from Chinese High School and Chung Cheng High School for pro-communist activities. (1956).

Apart from labour and student riots, communal tensions and inter-ethnic conflict were other causes of violent unrests in the 1950s and 1960s. The Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 and the communal clashes that broke out during Prophet Muhammad's birthday celebrations in 1964 are stark reminders of a turbulent period in Singapore's history.
Theme III: Political Awakening
As the process of decolonization spread across Asia after World War Two, calls for self-government in Singapore gained momentum amid post-war uncertainties and instability. Young, educated members of a disaffected class began to organise themselves, coming together to discuss the shortcomings of the government and plan their course of action, with the ultimate goal for Singapore to break away from colonial rule. It was under such a climate of political awakening that Singapore's constitutional development got underway, as the British took cautious steps to introduce greater local participation in government elections from 1948 to 1959.

The breakthrough came after the Rendel Commission of 1953 increased electoral powers, which led to David Marshall becoming Singapore's first Chief Minister of 1955. This was followed by three rounds of constitutional talks with the British to negotiate self-government for Singapore, culminating in the country's first election for a fully-elected Legislative Assembly in 1959. The 1959 General Election was won by the People's Action Party (PAP), and Lee Kuan Yew was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of Singapore.
Theme IV: Towards Nation-building
One of the tasks the PAP embarked on after winning the 1959 General Election was to carry out the social transformation it had promised the people, as the government looked to laying the grounds for building the nation. This included kick-starting Singapore's industrial development, and improving workers' welfare, the healthcare system, housing, education and transport. Dr Goh Keng Swee, then Minister for Finance, called for the formation of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) in 1961 to super the country's economic growth through industrialisation and investment promotion, driven by the priority to provide enough jobs for the people given the massive unemployment at that time.

Equal impetus was given to resolving Singapore's housing problems, with the Housing and Development Board (HDB) set up in 1960 to build mass public housing to ease the overcrowding situation.

Primary healthcare was also made more accessible to the people of Singapore as hospitals were modernised and mobile clinics were started, while health education and mass campaigns against diseases were launched. Reforms were implemented in the classrooms, too, as the education system was streamlined and improved to cater to the differing needs of the people.
At the same time, the PAP leaders recognised the importance of developing a sense of identity among the people, which they believed was tied to creating a Malayan culture in Singapore. Led by then Minister for Culture S Rajaratnam, the government sought to foster a multicultural and multiracial Malaya identity through the Aneka Ragam Rakyat (People's Cultural Concerts), a series of outdoor traditional shows organized to foster better understanding among the different ethnic groups. The National Loyalty Week was also held in 1959 to introduce national symbols including the state flag and national anthem to the people, which the government hoped would encourage a sense of loyalty among the people to the new nation.
Theme V: Cultural Life
Diverse cultural activities were already taking place on the ground at the time the government started to introduce initiatives and programmes aimed at promotion a sense of common Malayan identity among the people. While the PAP had created the People's Association (PA) to cultivate racial harmony and social cohesion among the population via recreational activities in community centres, such communal interactions were also playing out in public spaces including the three ""World"" amusement parks2, cinemas, and the Singapore Badminton Hall. Scenes of people from different ethnic backgrounds mingling with one another were common at these venues, as they came together to enjoy boxing matches, cultural dances, movies and sports.

Theme VI: Merger and Separation
When Singapore attained self-government in 1959, it symbolised the culmination of a momentous period of political awakening that had begun in the aftermath of the Japanese Occupation in 1945. As the desire of the people to manage their own affairs grew, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was convinced that complete independence could only be achieved through merger with the Federation of Malaya. This would quell the mounting threat of communism in Singapore, and at the same time secure the country's economic future as Malaya would provide a hinterland and common market for Singapore's manufactured goods.
However, Federation Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman did not share the same vision. He viewed the merger with Singapore's predominantly Chinese population as a threat to the privileged position of the Malays in Malaya, not to mention the threat of communism spreading to Malaya. In Singapore, the political party Barisan Sosialis - founded by left-wing members of the PAP who were expelled from the party in 1961 - also resisted the idea of a merger, fearing that their democratic rights and personal freedom would be curtailed.
Singapore, however, did become a part of the Federation in September 1963, after the Tunku finally proposed the creation of Malaysia following the fears that a pro-communist government might take over in Singapore after the PAP's defeat in the 1961 by-election in Hong Lim.
It was a union fraught with tension. The Sukarno government of Indonesia was against the merger, viewing it as a neo-colonial conspiracy by the British, which led Indonesia on an armed campaigned against Malay during a period known as Konfrontasi (Confrontation) from 1963 to 1965. Relations between the governments of Singapore and Malaysia did not improve after the merger, with one of the thorns being the PAP's decision to contest the 1964 General Election in Malaysia, which the Malaysian government interpreted as a challenge to their political power. Social tensions were also heightened during the racial riots in 1964 between the Chinese and Malays in Singapore, during which 22 people were killed and 461 injured. Furthermore, merger with Malaysia did not produce the expected economic deliverance for Singapore, as the Malaysian common market proved to be a pipe dream. It soon became clear that these irreparable differences made disengagement inevitable. On 9 August 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became an independent and sovereign state.

A New Chapter
""The misfortunes that befell Singapore in the first decade of her existence, from a self-governing state to a full independent republic, are forgotten by observers who believe ours has been a smooth and easy transition to self-sustaining growth. The truth is quite the reverse...""
- Dr Goh Keng Swee, A Socialist Economy That Works (1976).
The status Singapore enjoys today as an independent nation state, together with its social and economic stability, were built on the foundations laid during the difficult post-war years. From political strife to economic uncertainty and social unrest, the challenges Singapore faced from 1945 to 1965 had shaped its formative years as a fledging nation in its quest to build a national identity and secure independence.
Through this exhibition, visitors were able to gain an insight into the daily lives of the people during these two decades, a time when bread and butter issues - food shortages, housing and healthcare woes - were the main concerns of families in Singapore. At the same time, Singaporeans today had the opportunity to understand how these 20 years had set in motion the nation-building process and played a part in moulding the Singapore we know now.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2014
""Really?
The Singapore Botanic Gardens, a UNESCO World Heritage Site?""
This incredulity is one of the common sentiments I heard expressed when I spread the good news about the Singapore Botanic Gardens being nominated in 2014 as the nation's first UNESCO World Heritage Site. Also: ""Why the Botanic Gardens?""
Why, indeed? That's exactly what the exhibition ""More than a Garden"" sought to address. To understand the nomination, we first need to consider what the World Heritage List is really all about. To many, it is a prestigious compilation of the world's greatest historical and cultural treasures marked for preservation for all the world to share forever. That it is. But there is also a greater story of humanity that unfolds through this collection of Sites, and each Site on the list is meant to reflect one or more aspects of this grand narrative.
In 2014, there were 981 World Heritage Sites dotted across the globe, in 160 member states. Of all the states that have ratified the 1972 UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, only 30 did not yet have a World Heritage Site to their name. Singapore was one of these, due in some part to its newness as a nation and its petite size.
But for a nation so new, Singapore's Botanic Gardens has a relatively long history (it turned 155 in April 2014). And for a nation so small (and highly urbanised, and densely populated), it occupies a fairly large plot of prime land. Viewed solely in terms of time and space, the Botanic Gardens is unique in Singapore's context.
However, to rise to the status of a World Heritage Site, the site needed to possess more than local significance. So, of what value is our Gardens to the rest of the world?
First, the Gardens is the cradle of the rubber industry of Southeast Asia, which in turn has been the major source of natural rubber for the world since the 1920s - Southeast Asia accounts for 75% of all natural rubber produced in the world today. Versatile and useful, natural rubber moves people, literally. It is used in tyres â€“ of planes, automobiles, motorcycles â€“ and in shoe soles. Because it remains impermeable even though it is elastic, it is also used in latex gloves and contraceptives. There are also a myriad of other ways in which rubber is a part of our daily lives â€“ even when we don't notice it â€“ by providing a coating to many of our everyday items!
So you could say, perhaps, that the abundance of these items today around the world was due to the pioneering work done at the Singapore Botanic Gardens on the cusp of the 20th century. There, the First Director of the Gardens, Henry Nicholas Ridley, perfected the art of tapping latex from rubber trees.
Up until this time, rubber trees (in particular the Hevea brasiliensis, the most productive of all rubber tree species) were grown in Brazil, their native land. Ridley not only did scientific work on rubber, he also promoted it widely in Singapore and Malaya, which led to the rise of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia.
Using a series of panels, More than a Garden followed this exceptional story of rubber, and celebrated all things rubber.
Installation of rubber tires
Due to the work done at the Gardens, rubber became a vital part of our economy, and this is exemplified in the lives of four of Singapore's rubber pioneers â€“ Tan Chay Yan, Tan Kah Kee, Lim Nee Soon and Lee Kong Chian â€“ whose stories are featured in the exhibition.
It was not just the rubber plant that was experimented on in the Botanic Gardens.
The orchid, too, bloomed into fame, for it was from here that the commercial orchid breeding industry in Singapore and Southeast Asia began. And today, the Gardens is one of the top orchid research centres in the world.
It is such a core part of our Singapore identity that we have also given to various heads of states and celebrities from all over the word, as special gifts, orchids that have been named after them! At More than a Garden, visitors could celebrate this national flower - a scent-suous orchid photographic installation, for example, that surely appealed to their senses with its accompanying delicate orchid fragrances.
Besides its role in cultivating rubber and orchids, the Gardens is also part of a network of gardens that was important to the British Empire for the pursuit of botanical knowledge and commercial gain. The headquarters of these other tropical gardens was at Kew Gardens. It was also here that plants were tested for cultivation.
Of all the botanic gardens that were laboratories for the British Empire, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is the most well-preserved as it retains, to a large extent, its original layout.
Map of the Botanic Gardens
The Gardens was laid out in a typical English style, which means it was intentionally designed to look like it had naturally sprung from the ground (as opposed to other more formal and symmetrically ordered gardens elsewhere). Much of this is still visible today â€“ the winding paths, the undulating topography and water features (The Gardens' Swan Lake, by the way, is the oldest ornamental water body in Singapore â€“ landscaped in 1866). While the Gardens is laid out to look natural, it actually does have some features that are genuinely natural. For example, the Gardens is home to several trees that pre-date its establishment, and it is the only city botanic garden in the Eastern hemisphere that contains a piece of rainforest (six hectares of the original flora of Singapore, in our case)!
The Gardens also contains 13 conserved buildings and structures at the time of writing, some of which have been used for various special occasions. Burkill Hall, the oldest building in the Gardens, was where Ridley resided; and Holttum Hall, the newly converted Heritage Museum, was where orchid research was first carried out in the Gardens.
Despite its nomination as a World Heritage Site to be shared with the world, the Botanic Gardens is still very much Singapore's garden. The roots of the greening movement in Singapore can be traced back there. As early as the 1880s, it housed a nursery that grew trees that were later transplanted to roads around Singapore!
It also played a significant role in the fostering of racial harmony. It was the first site chosen for the Aneka Ragam Ra'ayat (Malay for â€˜People's Variety Show') in 1959, where Chinese, Malays, and Indians took the stage together for the first time and performed a variety of cultural items. Audience members of different races enjoyed the Chinese songs, the Indian dance, and some even learnt how to play the angklung!
During the launch of the show, our prime minister at the time, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, explained why the Gardens was chosen as the series' first venue:
â€œIt is fitting that the first of these concerts should be held in the Botanic Gardens, for, in a way, this beautiful place symbolises what we all want. Not only are beautiful things grown here, but some of the shrubs, flowers and trees are foreign importations which have taken root in [our] soil... Here, under open skies, Malays, Chinese, Indians, will, I hope, discover the materials for a national art and national culture.â€
For all the big-picture history the Gardens possesses, it's also a place close to the heart of many Singaporeans.
Over the past few months, as I ploughed through old news about the Gardens, and collected various memories, I've found that there are so many stories (some quite amusing) that make the Gardens truly more than a garden to many.
Countless pre-wedding photographs have been shot there (perhaps taken in the hope that their marriages will last as long as the Gardens have?), and the swans have been fed by many a passer-by â€“ one of them was actually my friend who almost fed the swan her finger too. For years, the Gardens has also been a place of refuge from urban life (or for teenagers who wanted to run away from home, or just escape school for a bit), and so much more.
All these reasons make the Gardens so unique â€“ it is international in significance, but very much local in flavour. It is a place of the awesome and the ordinary, the unique and the ubiquitous... It is indeed a garden for Singapore, and for the world.

Every 9th of August is celebrated with style in Singapore. The traditional fly-past of Singapore's state flag, exciting parachuting performances by the red lions, and the march past of the parade contingents have become synonymous with our National Day celebrations.
Through this showcase of National Day Parade (NDP) photographs taken by the then Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA) Photo Unit, witness how the celebration of our nation's independence have transformed over the years, as seen through the eyes of MICA photographers. The MICA was renamed Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) in 2012.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Yoshie-Osawa-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"â€œYou will enjoy learning about Singapore's history and change your own history!â€ This is what Yoshie Osawa was told when she moved to Singapore in 1992. And, she found it to be true, especially when she became a docent here.
Yoshie moved to Singapore when she married a Singaporean. Through one of the oldest docent groups in Singapore, Yoshie began to learn a great deal about Singapore's history. The Japanese Docents (JD) group was formed in 1981. When you enter the National Museum of Singapore (NMS), you may notice that many of the captions with Japanese translations are done by the JD. Japanese tours are also conducted at the Museum. Yoshie guides mainly at the National Museum and also at the Singapore Arts Museum, Peranakan Museum, and the Singapore Musical Box Museum.
How it started
What started Yoshie on this journey of studying Singapore's history was a visit she made with her friend who was guiding at the Asian Civilisations Museum. The exhibition was â€œJourney of Faith: Art and History from the Vatican Collectionâ€. Her friend was able to talk about the artefacts and exhibits even though she was not a Catholic. Yoshie was so impressed that she decided to become a docent. After two to three months of training, Yoshie started guiding in 2006. The Japanese docents organise their own training by having the senior docents undertake the mentoring and training of newly enrolled ones. Yoshie also did the Japanese-related tours in Singapore as a part of the National Heritage Festival.
Yoshie has met a relative of Singapore's earliest Japanese resident who lived in the Upper Wilkie Road house that was known as Osborne House at Emily Hill. The house was bought by a Singapore-based Japanese, Jukichi Ikeda. His nephew's daughter, who is 83-year-old Miyoko Sato (Yoshida), visited the home she lived in last as a 5-year-old. The photographers and media gathered to meet her when she came to Singapore after having left it at such an early age. It was a pivotal moment for many, including Yoshie. Miyoko's photos are exhibited at â€œWitness To War: Remembering 1942â€ at NMS in 2017. Some of the photos were donated to the National Archive.
Yoshie feels that Singapore and the National Heritage Board (NHB) have been extremely kind to allow for these memories to be kept alive. Mamoru Shinozaki, whose photo hangs at the National Museum, is considered the â€œOskar Schindler of Singaporeâ€ during the war. He is more famous in Singapore than in Japan. Early this year, Shinozaki's relative visited NMS. His relatives did not know about Mamoru Shinozaki's fame in Singapore. For the Japanese docents, it is an exciting and important story to tell.
Japanese docents
According to Yoshie, the JD group is grateful to the National Heritage Board for allowing them to do Japanese tours. As a people, they love to learn about the history and culture of the places they move to. Yoshie highlights this point and says â€œMany Japanese join the museum as volunteers and totally immerse themselves so deep in the learning. They study everything about Singapore and learn so much. And, among ourselves we all have a common interest. Everybody enjoys guiding.â€
The Singapore Musical Box Museum and Japan
Yoshie started to guide at another museum two years ago â€” the Singapore Musical Box Museum. Naoto Orui is its founder. Half of them are from the U.K. The museum aims to share the historical background of the musical boxes and how they made their way to Singapore. While there is usually someone to operate the musical boxes, Yoshie enjoys guiding at this very special museum. Yoshie points out that the museum staff who operate the instruments speak English, Japanese, and Chinese. Yoshie herself speaks both English and Japanese. She has learnt Mandarin but does not speak it as well as she would like to.
Yoshie, unlike many of the other Japanese docents, will remain in Singapore well into the future. Most of the other docents are wives of expatriate husbands and may move on after two or three years. Yoshie, on the other hand, will continue to be here. Singapore is her home.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Muhammad-Hafiz-bin-Rashid-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"A songkok (a cap widely worn by Muslim males), a checked sarong (a tube of cloth worn around the waist by Malay Muslims), and a silky blue shirt .
A blangkon (a batik headdress worn by Javanese men), a batik sarong and a surjan (a long sleeved Javanese jacket which is often made from a striped fabric known as lurik) â€” this is what 26-year-old Muhammad Hafiz bin Rashid refers to as his â€œdefault attireâ€.
Sometimes his friends do not recognise him when he is not in this traditional attire. This young man takes pride in being an ethnic Malay, and it is a new-found phase in his life. The trigger for this came when he was a Polytechnic student. He went to the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC) for an exhibition on â€œIlham Alhamâ€ which is about the medicinal qualities of plants. The outcome was a hunger to explore his roots. It led to him becoming a docent at MHC.
Becoming a docent
Hafiz became a frequent visitor to the MHC. His visits to the MHC were noticed by a staff member who, in turn, suggested that he volunteer as a guide. He jumped at the idea because with that would come training and a chance to learn more about his own roots. â€œIt helped me to learn more about my own heritage which I was not really aware of previously,â€ said Hafiz. He became one of its youngest guides.
Hafiz is quick to point out that many people assume that, as a Malay, he would be better informed than most about his own heritage. He says that going to the museum makes you appreciate your own culture and heritage a lot more.
The rigorous two- to three-month training that he underwent to become a guide was also a huge plus. He used to have a huge gap in knowledge about his ethnic heritage. During docent training, he had the best of knowledge-providers. They were from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and National University of Singapore (NUS). Hafiz recalls, â€œThey told us about the history of Kampong Glam as well as certain cultural practices â€” the significance of the history, its origins, its influences â€” it's really something that wasn't taught in schools.â€
A deeper appreciation of the Malay culture and heritage has grown for Hafiz as a result of becoming a guide.
Building on history
The visitors Hafiz meets while guiding is also another way for this full-time library officer to top-up on his knowledge. Take, for instance, Nenek Hasnah (â€œnenekâ€ is Malay for granny). It was an instagramable-moment when the two met. In fact, it is now part of Hafiz's instagram stories.
Nenek Hasnah was visiting MHC with her daughter. While taking her through the first gallery on the map of the Malay world, Nenek Hasnah started to speak of her personal experiences. Born of a Javanese mother and a Malay father, she made the treacherous journey with her family to Singapore. Their ship caught fire at the coast of Pulau Buaya and eventually they had no choice but to jump into the sea. Clearly, she survived and settled in Arab Street (then known as Kampong Java). She remembers the Arab Street of old very well, including her neighbours.
Hafiz keeps in touch with his new-found friend and uses her stories in his guided tours.
Tracing their Malay roots
Hafiz has had interesting encounters with overseas Malays. He has a great deal of respect for them because they have come a great distance to trace their ancestry. Those are times Hafiz is also grateful for the opportunity of being a guide. â€œAt least they leave the place enriched by that extra piece of knowledge that I was able to impart,â€ he says.
For the local visitor, he likes giving them extra knowledge and he also likes the fact that he might be â€œpeeling away the misconceptionsâ€ as well.
Visitors come from all over the world. Once he had the unexpected privilege of guiding Cape Malays from Capetown, South Africa. Hafiz had nothing but admiration for them â€” travelling all this way to discover their roots. He felt humbled and had a strong sense of responsibility to share all that he knows about this region and the Malays. In the same vein, Hafiz had a healthy exchange with the Cape Malays about their lives in South Africa and what it was like living through the apartheid era.
These visitors have made a deep impression on him. Thanks to the MHC visitors from far away, it has now become his dream to, in turn, visit his own family's hometown â€” in Bawean island, Indonesia.
Growing as a docent
One great takeaway for Hafiz is that there is a great deal of mixing in Singapore with the other cultures and he gets to see the bigger picture.
To illustrate his point, he referred to his checked sarong. In this part of the world, it is a common design. But, he then highlights the fact that it was Indian traders who brought such designs to South East Asia in the first place.
To illustrate his point, he referred to his batik sarong. The motif on the sarong is known as tambal. He then explained that the tambal motif itself is a patchwork of different batik motifs - some of which are derived from Indian mythology such as the mythical Garuda, the bird mount of the Hindu god Vishnu.
He does not stop at appreciating such interlinks between cultures. Hafiz is now learning a new regional language â€” Kristang spoken by the local Portuguese-Eurasians. â€œIt's a melange of Malay and Portuguese and also some of the other languages such as Chinese dialects and even Indian languages.â€
For this young Malay Singaporean, being a docent is far more than guiding at MHC â€” he is on his own journey to discover his roots and pass on his cultural heritage.

What is communication? The word originates from the Latin term communicare, meaning to â€œshareâ€ or â€œmake commonâ€. By exploring the development of communication, we can chart mankind's progress across the fields of science, history and technology.
Text by Chua Mei Lin
BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2011
What is communication? The word originates from the Latin term communicare, meaning to â€œshareâ€ or â€œmake commonâ€. By exploring the development of communication, we can chart mankind's progress across the fields of science, history and technology.
Before the advent of writing, men gathered to narrate stories and exchange ideas. Some daily routines and annual occurrences were recorded on walls, stones and bones. Later, the written and printed word encouraged learning and more people participated in this form of communication. With a little help from electricity, words were then transmitted over greater distances.
The tools of communication have gone through amazing transformations. Without missing a step, we call, email or text each other. Communication engages people and it draws the world closer. In Message Me, a 2011 exhibition at the Singapore Philatelic Museum, we reflected on men's ingenuity in overcoming obstacles in the effort to share and in keep in touch.
Cuneiform and Hieroglyphs
In the prehistoric era, men communicated by speaking. Individuals talked to other people around them but not to those who were far away. A man could use his memory to store some information for the future but he had no way of saving it in other forms. To preserve the stories they knew, early man drew simple pictures on cave walls. Over time, these images became more detailed and complex and started to represent animals and objects encountered by early men. This was the beginning of writing.
Clay remnants found in the Mesopotamia region show shapes of animals, food and clothes. Some of the earliest forms of writing can be traced to the Sumerians of Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE. Clay was an early writing surface but it was not easy to use. Depending on the writing tool used, the lines could be of different thicknesses.
Instead of curves, wedge-shaped lines were used. This wedge-shaped writing is known as cuneiform script.
When cities were first built, their inhabitants began to specialise in different fields of work. Some became farmers or herders of animals, while others worked as craftsmen making pottery and baskets. Traders helped to exchange goods. Very often, the products of one city were traded in other towns. To keep track of these items and their movements, early traders used clay tablets to record their goods.
Hieroglyphic script appeared in Egypt around 3,100 BCE. The ancient Egyptians started with pictograms (picture signs) and phonograms (sound signs).
Ideograms â€“ signs that represent ideas or things â€“ were introduced later.
For a long time, nobody could translate the hieroglyphs until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 by a French soldier with Napoleon's army in Egypt. It took Frenchman Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion 15 years before he made the connections and deciphered the hieroglyphs in 1822.
Alphabet and Writing
Not everybody can draw, and given the sheer number of things to be represented, the alphabet was invented. The alphabet is a selection of consonant and vowel sounds which form words when strung together. The English language, for instance, comprises words made up of 26 letters. The Chinese written language uses nine basic strokes, but when combined, these create a vocabulary of more than 100,000 characters. In its simplest form, the Tamil language has 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one special character.
What did man use to write in the early days? During the Stone Age, men wrote on pre-existing materials such as rocks, bones and cave walls. Clay tablets later provided a handy surface but were heavy and required laborious preparation before they could be used. The ancient Egyptians used papyrus, a paper-like material made from the pith of an aquatic sedge native to the Nile River. In the Middle Ages, leather and parchment made from animal skin were used for manuscripts. Around the 2nd century CE, Cai Lun, an official at the Chinese court of Emperor He of the eastern Han dynasty, invented paper. Europeans learnt about paper much later in the 12th century when the Venetian Marco Polo visited China.
To write, the ancient Egyptians used the trimmed ends of reeds. Metal styluses were used in the Roman Empire, but due to an alarmingly high number of stabbings, they were banned and replaced by bone and ivory tools. In the Middle Ages, writing was done using quill pens obtained from duck and goose feathers. A scribe would dip the sharpened end of the quill into a jar of ink, tap off the excess ink and put quill to paper. As quills wore out very quickly, some people turned to more lasting materials such as horn and tortoiseshell.
Much later, the Briton Samuel Harrison crafted pen points of metal in 1780 and this marked the birth of modern steel pens. The fountain pen was patented by Lewis Edson Waterman, an American, in 1884. With an internal reservoir of ink, this tool advanced the art of writing to a new level. In 1945, the Hungarian LÃ¡szlÃ³ JÃ³zsef BÃ­rÃ³ invented the portable and disposable ballpoint pen.
Letters of Note
Ever since writing was invented, letters served to bridge distances between people. Letters nurtured relationships, maintained friendships, conveyed condolences and best wishes, and even provided missing pieces of information for historians and biographers of notable personalities.
Some letters are serious and historic. For example, the physicist Albert Einstein wrote to US President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 to warn him of the German government's interest in developing atomic weapons. This letter prompted the formation of an Advisory Committee on Uranium and the start of America's nuclear research programme.
How much is a love letter worth? A lot if you are John Keats, the great English poet of the Romantic Period. In March 2011, one of Keats' love letters to his fiancÃ©e Frances (Fanny) Brawne fetched Â£96,000 at an auction in London.
Letters also provided a means of communication for early migrants. In the 1800s, many Chinese men landed in Singapore to seek jobs. These manual workers and coolies were mostly illiterate. Letter writers were in great demand by migrants who wanted to send money and messages back to their families in China. These letters provided an essential lifeline and a source of comfort for the workers.
Printing and Typing
Before the invention of the printing press, books were written by hand. This made books very special and expensive. The Chinese invented block printing some time in the 8th century. To make copies, pictures and text were carved on wooden blocks. The blocks were first coated with ink and a piece of paper was laid the surface and pressed to transfer the contents of the print. In the 11th century, Pi Sheng, a Chinese, made individual clay types, the world's first movable type. A movable type consists of individual letters or characters that can be assembled and rearranged to form different words and texts. Pi Sheng's clay types, however, broke easily and the sheer number of characters in the Chinese language made it impossible to carve enough types.
In 1450, the German Johannes Gutenberg developed movable metal types for printing. Using this method, he invented a press that was used to create the first printed book, the two-volume Gutenberg Bible. Printing revolutionised communication. As books became affordable and common, more people learnt to read and write and the dissemination of new ideas, discoveries and information became faster and more widespread.
The typewriter was invented by Christopher Latham Sholes, an American newspaper editor, in 1868. The original keyboard, with a layout commonly known as QWERTY, is still in use today. This arrangement of the letters on the keyboard prevented typists from working too fast, which caused the keys on the machine to jam. Confusingly, the first people who used Sholes' invention were also called typewriters. Only later were they known as typists.
From Poniesto the Penny Post
In the old days, only royalty, religious leaders and the very rich could afford to send letters. Runners were employed to carry the letters. Later, horseback riders covered greater distances and achieved higher speeds using a relay system with fresh horses at regular stations. The most famous of these was the Pony Express of the American West. Another courier of correspondence and probably the earliest form of airmail was the carrier pigeon, which ferried messages attached to its legs or tail.
Ordinary people relied on the goodwill of travellers to carry their letters. Sometimes, the letters failed to reach their destination. As more people became literate and communicated with each other, the penny post was introduced in 1683. For a penny, the London penny post would convey messages anywhere within the city of London. This was the beginning of a postal service for the masses.
Very few people in ancient times knew how to read and write, including kings and queens. Scribes, people who specialised in writing, therefore played a very important role in ancient civilisations. They took note of offerings made at temples, recorded tributes paid to the rulers, wrote contracts and accounts for traders, penned wills and generated official correspondence.
In the Middle Ages, under the patronage of kings, wealthy nobles and powerful religious orders, scribes documented historical events, judicial and legal records, and copied books and sacred texts. But with the invention of printing in the 15th century, these professional writers soon lost their importance.
Smoke and Mirrors
Signals are messages communicated without words. Like doorbells and sirens, they usually convey only one simple message. Primitive tribes sent messages by beating drums which could be heard at a distance by other tribes. Signals that use visual means include smoke, fire and light. Native Americans used blankets to control the smoke over a fire as a method of sending messages to distant tribes. On a good day, these signals could be seen from afar. But this technique was not possible on windy days or at night.
Another way of sending messages was to reflect sunlight on mirrors. As early as the 5th century BC, the Greeks were already using sunlight reflected on metal mirrors to convey signals. In 1867, British Royal Navy Captain Philip Colomb introduced the use of a lantern to send messages from ship to ship. A few years later, the British inventor Arthur Aldis built an electrically powered signal lamp which was faster and brighter. Light continues to be a warning system in functions such as lighthouses and traffic lights.
Flying the Flag
Semaphore signalling uses an alphabet-based flag system. A signal man holds up two bi-coloured flags to indicate alphabets, numbers or a universal standard code. Naval communication flags have been used since the days of Christopher Columbus when he explored the New World.
Ensigns are national flags displayed by ships to show their origin and status: friend or foe. Naval signal flags are governed by the International Code of Signals. Ship crews of all nationalities understand and use this universal messaging system. During Singapore's early years, flags were flown at Fort Canning. They signalled the arrival of a ship with mail. A red ensign indicated the arrival of European ships while a yellow flag stood for ships from China. In the night, residents were informed of arriving mail by the firing of a gun.
The Birth of Modern Telecommunication
In the 1830s, the American inventor Samuel Morse devised the telegraph system and this marked the beginning of modern long-distance communication. Using electric currents to represent letters or numbers, an operator taps on a transmitter to produce short or long buzzes. A short buzz is called a dot and a long one is called a dash. Combined, these dots and dashes spell out a message. The most famous is the universal code dot-dot-dot, dash-dash-dash, dot-dot-dot for â€œSOSâ€ in emergencies.
In Britain, the first successful telegraph line was built in 1837 by William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. This system was originally used by railway operators to send messages to stations about train services. Later, underwater sea cables connected continents. The first telegraph link using this method was between Britain and France in 1850. A submarine telegraph link was eventually laid out between Europe and America after many unsuccessful attempts.
Several inventors in America and Europe were developing the telephone at around the same time but it was Alexander Graham Bell who made the breakthrough in 1876. Bell allegedly cried, â€œMr Watson, come here. I want youâ€ when he spilled battery acid on his clothes. His colleague Thomas Watson, who was in the next room, heard Bell's voice over a wire. Thus the telephone was invented.
Today, instead of wires, our voices are converted into beams of light and transferred through thin strands of glass called optical fibres. It was said that in 1891, an American funeral parlour owner named Almon Strowger was so upset with the bad service of the switchboard telephone operators that he invented the automatic telephone exchange.
New Waves of Communication
Radio waves travel through the air and do not need wires â€“ making them very useful for establishing contact with airplanes and ships. Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, discovered radio waves in the 1880s. Based on Hertz's discovery, the Italian Guglielmo Marconi experimented with transmitting radio waves and successfully sent a â€œwireless telegraphâ€ across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901.
In 1906, using radio waves, Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden made the first radio broadcast of voice and music. As early as 1927, engineers were experimenting with sending pictures using radio waves. After solving some major technical difficulties, television broadcasting arrived in the houses of the general public in the late 1940s and quickly became the most popular form of home entertainment and communication in the 20th century.
Making Communication Mobile
Primitive mobile phones made their first appearance in the 1940s but it took another forty years before these devices became affordable and practical. Early mobile phones weighed about 34 kg and were mainly fitted in cars. Besides making calls, mobile phones today, or more correctly smart phones, are multiple usage devices. They enable us to send text and video messages, exchange email, browse the Internet, play games, capture images, make voice recordings, play music, listen to the radio and navigate using the global positioning system or GPS.
The first text message was apparently sent by Neil Papworth, a young test engineer, from his personal computer to a friend's phone on Christmas 1992. Text messaging is probably the most highly used mobile data service. The activity is so popular that â€œtextingâ€ and other similar phrases have entered the mainstream lexicon. Interestingly, text messages and ancient Egyptian writing share a similarity â€“ the use of rebus, meaning pictures or symbols that represent words. Text, numbers and pictures are often combined in a single message. For example, â€œi <3 uâ€ uses the pictogram of a heart to represent love and convey a message that is simple and direct.
One-to-one communication is still prevalent, but staying in touch with large groups of people and the world en masse through mobile channels like Facebook and Twitter is becoming a major trend in smartphone usage.
The Internet, The World Wide Web and Email
The Internet has its origins in a 1950s military research project in the United States to counter Soviet missile threats. The early model was called SAGE; it had several keyboards and screens attached to one big computer. In 1969, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network or ARPANET was built. It allowed scientists in the US Department of Defense to share information.
This was a new type of computer network that would not break down even if one or more of the computers did not work. Large universities and other research institutions joined the network and made it a worldwide system of interconnected networks and computers. The Internet was introduced to the public in 1983. With about 14 billion users today, the Internet can be described as a global system of interconnected networks and computers.
The World Wide Web or Web is a way for information to be retrieved and distributed over the Internet. In the early years of the ARPANET, to find information, one needed to know where to look and use complex computer codes. Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, changed this when he created the World Wide Web. Initially the Web was meant only for scientists but in 1991 it was made available to the public. The Web uses computer languages like http (short for hypertext transfer protocol) to send information. To call up pages with graphics, sound, text and video, users access the web through software called browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox.
Electronic mail or email actually predates the Internet but it was the computer network at ARPANET that contributed to its development. Email started as a digital message board for scientists working on ARPANET where the @ address format was born.
Communication and You
Technology is advancing at an amazing pace and bringing people closer through faster and easier communication. With the advent of the Internet, all traditional forms of communications have become condensed and accelerated. Communication has become more rapid but not necessarily error-free.
What is communication to you?

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 1 - Apr to Jun 2015
An exhibition borne from a landmark book project on Singapore's early Modern architecture was held at the National Museum of Singapore from 17 April to 18 May as part of the Singapore HeritageFest 2015. Organised by National Museum of Singapore in partnership with Singapore Heritage Society, the exhibition was a showcase of the late Jeremy San Tzer Ning's remarkable photography.
In documenting Singapore's modern architectural heritage, the award-winning architectural photographer's pictures pay tribute to the often overlooked, everyday structures that form the backdrop of our daily lives: public flats, places of worship, schools, markets and workplaces. Taken over 10 years, these selected photos capture the struggles and achievements of the milieu and Singapore's endangered early Modernist architecture as it stood in the first decade of the 21st Century.
National Library
Inauguration: 1960 Architect: Public Works Department, Singapore.
The modest red-bricked structure, designed by Public Works Department architect Lionel Bintley, was inaugurated in 1960 by Singapore's first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (or Head or State) Yusof bin Ishak. While the institution originated in 1823 as a private collection, philanthropist Lee Kong Chian gave a seed donation in the 1950s and rallied for a public library with publications in â€œvernacular languagesâ€. Generations have since passed through its brick porches, as the understated Stamford Road library evolved into one of the few post-war civic spaces that Singaporeans, across class and ethnicity divides, identified with. Captured before the building's demise, the photograph shows the library courtyard, an urban oasis graced by shady trees and a fountain, well-loved for poetry recitals and nursing a cup of coffee.
Trinity Theological College Chapel
Inauguration: 1970 Architect: Chan Kui Chuan.
The Trinity Theological College Chapel is an excellent example of later modern tropical church design that evolved from the 1950s. The building is replete with layers of religious symbolism. Occupying a wooded, undulating site on Mount Sophia, the chapel is a simple rectangular pavilion capped by a sculptural roof form, derived from the Chinese character äºº (â€œhumanâ€) â€” chosen as an appropriate representation of the chapel's role as an interdenominational gathering space.
Tanjong Pagar Railway Station
Inauguration: 1932 Architect: Swan & Maclaren.
The former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station is gazetted as a National Monument, following the landmark June 2010 agreement that saw the transfer of the former Malayan railway land from Malaysia to Singapore. Underneath the graceful arches, inset panels with arabesque motifs are subtle local inflections in an otherwise internationalist design devoid of overt ethnic symbols, unlike the contemporaneous Federated Malay States Railway Headquarters in Kuala Lumpur.
National Stadium
Inauguration: 1973 Architect: Public Works Department, Singapore.
Designed by the Public Works Department of Singapore, the National Stadium was conceived as the centrepiece of the Kallang Park Sports Complex, a comprehensive mass spectator sports, leisure, and exhibition centre that would occupy the former landing grounds of Kallang Airport. For the subsequent three decades, the edifice was the unrivalled venue of numerous memorable matches and spectacular National Day Parades.
Clifford Pier
Inauguration: 1933 Architect: Public Works Department, Singapore.
Clifford Pier was inaugurated by Straits Settlements Governor Cecil Clementi in 1933. It was one of the three major transportation â€˜gateways' of interwar Singapore â€” the other two being Tanjong Pagar Railway Station (1932), and Kallang Airport (1937). Replacing the mid-nineteenth-century Johnston's Pier, Clifford Pier was an engineering feat of its times, with its 10 reinforced concrete arched trusses 36 feet high and spanning 60 feet across, resulting in a column-free space that facilitated passenger traffic flow.

Sited atop Pearl's Hill and towering over the densely populated shophouses of Kreta Ayer, the visionary project achieved several breakthroughs when it was built in 1976. As Singapore's first urban renewal residential development, Pearl Bank was among the world's most densely populated apartment blocks and the tallest apartment in Asia.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 1 â€“ Jan to Mar 2014
In the course of preparing for the 2014 exhibition â€˜A Changed World: Singapore Art 1950s-1970s' one of the challenges that confronted my co-curator, Daniel Tham, and myself was the use of terms in discussions about modern art in Singapore. These terms in themselves demarcate boundaries which limit and exclude â€“ and, in many instances, these boundaries are extremely ill-defined. The result is a problematic set of terms which one may, at best, use loosely, and with the utmost care due to their inadequacies. In particular, the contention over the use of the terms â€˜pioneer' and â€˜second generation' is one which we would like to explore further1. This article makes no attempt to resolve the issues of categorisation; rather, it aims to encourage readers to reflect on these terms, and to appreciate the richness and complexities of our art history.
Of The Term â€˜Pioneer': Inclusions and Exclusions
The term â€˜pioneer artists' is commonly used in writings on local art history. So who are these recognised â€˜pioneers' of our visual art history? Who are those who are consistently regarded as â€˜pioneers'? Are there geographical and age limits that are attached to the term? From when do we chart the beginnings of our visual art history?
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term â€˜pioneer' refers to â€˜a person or group that originates or helps open up a new line of thought or activity or a new method or technical development', or â€˜one of the first to settle in a territory'. If we were to combine both definitions, then the term â€˜pioneer' would refer only to immigrant artists, resulting in the loss of an important facet of our culturally diverse history as important non-immigrant artists would be excluded from this category. Geography and chronology further complicate matters, for the study of Singapore's history and its art cannot be divorced from the history of Malaya, which, in turn, brings us back to the colonial period. And if we say our visual history has its roots in the colonial period, how early should we start tracking it, and on what grounds?
From the late 1980s to early 1990s, â€˜pioneer' status has been conferred on artists like Liu Kang, Cheong Soo Pieng, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, Lim Hak Tai, Georgette Chen and Lim Cheng Hoe, with the latter three occasionally forgotten and omitted. All seven artists were Chinese immigrants who had settled in Singapore before and after World War II, trained and tutored a great number of art students, and later became full-time artists. The conferment of â€˜pioneer' status carries with it the understanding that these artists significantly impacted and contributed to the local art scene. While there is no doubt these seven artists deserved it, many more artists should be remembered as pioneers as well.
Artist Tsang Ju Chi, for example, is a forgotten pioneer. Trained in Shanghai and Paris, Tsang arrived in Singapore in the 1930s and actively organised art exhibitions featuring works depicting local subject matter. Although he was chiefly involved in commercial art, he was dedicated to promoting local art, especially in his capacity as the chairman of the Society of Chinese Artists. He also sought to groom young artists by organising the Youth Encouragement Society art exhibitions2. As a painter himself, he was known for his oil paintings of local Malay folk and fishermen. Unfortunately, none of Tsang's works survived. He was killed in the Sook Ching massacre during the Japanese Occupation.
Besides Tsang, artists such as Suri Mohyani, M. Sawoot bin Haji Rahman and Mahat bin Chaadang, Lee Ta Pai, Liu Sien Teh, Chong Pai Mu, See Hiang To, Chen Jen Hao, Wu Tsai Yen, Fan Chang Tien, Chang Tan-Nung and Sunyee should be regarded as pioneer artists for their significant contributions as artists and art educators in our history. When examining our art history, it is also important to note the significance of Penang. Hence, the works of the pioneers who were active there - in particular, Abdullah Ariff and Yong Mun Sen - should be taken into account too when studying Singapore's early art history. And if we were to rethink the constraints of time and space in our history, should we not regard the dedicated art inspector and artist Richard Walker - who made great contributions to the development of watercolour painting in Singapore and Malaya - as a â€˜pioneer' too?
â€˜Second Generation': When Does It Begin?
The term â€˜second generation' probably began to appear in the late 1990s to early 2000s. It generally referred to artists who were most probably taught by â€˜pioneer' or â€˜first generation' artists. In many cases, it is assumed that the artists received training at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, or that they were taught by the â€˜pioneers' privately, or in classes held at Chinese medium schools. It is also believed that many of these â€˜second generation' artists received further training in art overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom, other European countries and the United States. Artists who went to these countries to study in the mid-1950s to the early 1970s, such as Thomas Yeo, Yeo Hoe Koon, Anthony Poon, Teo Eng Seng, Ng Eng Teng, Tan Teo Kwang, Wee Beng Chong and Goh Beng Kwan are generally categorised as â€˜second generation' artists. Choy Wen Yang, Lu Kuo Siang, Latiff Mohidin, and Eng Tow are also categorised as second generation artists due to their overseas training, but they were not taught by any first generation artists.
And then, there are the artists who did not have the opportunity to be trained overseas in Western countries - students of the â€˜first generation pioneers', who were successful in their own right. These include artists such as Tay Chee Toh, Tan Ping Chiang, See Cheen Tee, Foo Chee San and Koeh Sia Yong. Moreover, the term â€˜second generation' also implies that these artists stood for and embraced Western abstraction in their art3. For example, Tay Chee Toh is widely recognised as a â€˜second generation' artist. However, the boundaries start to blur again in the case of artists who were students of the first generation who did not embrace Western abstraction. These artists include Ong Kim Seng, a prominent watercolour artist; See Cheen Tee and Foo Chee San, who specialised in wood block printing; as well as Koeh Sia Yong and Chua Mia Tee, who adhered to realism throughout their careers.
Then there is the issue of time: when does the â€˜second generation' begin? Should the limits of a generation be defined, or should one only consider the peak of an artist's career as the period of time that defines his or her generation? Can artists such as Lai Foong Moi, Foo Chee San, Choo Keng Kwang, Lim Tze Peng, Chua Mia Tee, Chen Cheng Mei and Yeh Chi Wei and Abdul Ghani Hamid â€“ all of whom were born between 1910s and 1930s â€“ be regarded as â€˜second generation'? How should we categorise these artists, who do not fit the mould of â€˜pioneers' or â€˜second generation' artists? Or should we simply ignore these categorisations and honour these artists for their unique contributions to our art history?
Indeed, the use of the terms â€˜pioneer' and â€˜second generation' throws up more questions than answers, raising issues that will not be immediately â€“ or ever â€“ resolved. This is because the reality of art-making and its history is not one of neat and convenient categorisations. The spirit of a milieu can be ingrained in an artist's works but if he/she is to be called an â€˜artist' in the first place, his or her unique voice has to come through and withstand the test of time - and transcend boundaries.
Szan Tan is Curator, National Museum of Singapore
The contentions surrounding the use of the term and category â€˜first generation pioneers' and â€˜second generation' were first raised in 2007 by Wang Zineng in his endnotes to the article â€˜Curatorial Notes', in the exhibition catalogue â€˜Bodies and Relationships: Selected works of Lee Sik Khoon', presented by NUS Museums.

3 The abstract works of these artists should not be seen merely as imitations or derivations of Nicholson, Rothko, Motherwell, De Kooning, Pollock, Kline or Hoffman for their expressions possess a universality that transcends space and time. At times an Eastern spirit can be detected in the use of strokes, lines, and composition.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/lee-kuan-yew/story,"TL;DR
Lee Kuan Yew (16 September 1923â€“23 March 2015), the founder of modern Singapore, was a brilliant statesman and highly-regarded visionary who transformed the island into a formidable nation and economic powerhouse.
Over three decades from 1959 to 1990, Lee as prime minister of Singapore, developed policies to improve living standards and education levels, ensure security and stability, and attract investment.1 He remained in service to the country until he passed away in 2015 at the age of 91.
Dodging a bullet
Lee was an academically gifted student who attended Raffles Institution and won a scholarship to study at Raffles College.2 His time at the college, however, was disrupted when the Japanese Army came a-knocking in 1942.3
Like many other Chinese males in Singapore, Lee was in danger of being rounded up for â€˜Operation Sook Ching' â€” a massacre where members of the Kempeitai or Japanese military police mercilessly executed people they believed to be anti-Japanese.4
While out with his family's go-to rickshaw driver, Koh Teong Koo,5 they encountered Japanese soldiers who ordered them to report to a screening exercise. Understanding the gravity of the situation, the men resorted to quick tactical thinking to stay alive â€“ a friend of Koh's had a residence at 75 Maude Road located within the registration centre's boundaries. The pair thus hid in the house until Lee found an opportune time to slip away following a change of guard.6
Lee's political awakening
While studying at the London School of Economics and Cambridge University, Lee got involved with the British Labour Party and the anti-colonial Malayan Forum.8 This experience deepened his interest in politics and reinforced his belief that the way forward for Singapore was independence â€“ not subservience. Interacting with fellow patriots and members of the forum such as Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye further spurred Lee's eventual foray into politics.9
A secret wedding
Lee received a first-class law degree in 1949 and was called to the bar at London's Middle Temple in 1950. Apart from academics, he also made time for romance, pursuing Kwa, a Queen's Scholar. The pair married in secret in December 1947 in Stratford, England.10

The reason behind their discretion? Few parents and scholarship boards of the 1940s were open to the idea of marriage before graduation.11
Both husband and wife were eventually called to the bar in Singapore on 7 August 1951.12
Fighting for the rights of locals
Lee, who began his law career with the firm Laycock and Ong, became politically engaged in a variety of causes. Among other things, he advised trade unions and clan associations on legal matters, and even fought tooth and nail for local civil servants to receive the same benefits as their European counterparts.13
His efforts caught the eye of members of the public who viewed him as the voice of the people.14
In 1959, Lee â€“ having set up law firm Lee & Lee with his wife and brother four years before â€“ decided to leave the field and plunge himself full-time into politics.15

Carving a nation out of a colony
In 1954, Lee gathered a team of passionate patriots and gamechangers such as Goh and Toh for a series of clandestine meetings to discuss the nation's future.16 On 21 November that year, Singapore's first independent government was established.
The newly-formed party went on to contest in the 1955 Legislative Assembly elections, their relatable personalities and fiery speeches winning the hearts of locals. Lee himself was elected to represent the constituency of Tanjong Pagar,17 a position he maintained for 60 years until his death in 2015.18
A powerful orator, Lee's rousing speeches and persuasive debating style subsequently led him and the PAP to a strong victory in the 1959 elections where his party captured 43 of the 51 available assembly seats. Lee, at the rather tender age of 35, became the prime minister of the self-governing state of Singapore.19
Merger with Malaya
From the outset, Lee believed that Singapore needed a hinterland or a larger country to lean on for natural resources and economic stability. This, as well as other concerns, led him to propose and push for a controversial merger with Malaya.20
Lee Kuan Yew walks alongside Tengku Abdul Rahman before he heads off to London to discuss about Singapore's merger with Malaya. (c.1962. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Lee, however, faced multiple challenges along the way.
For instance, some within the PAP were unable to accept his idea. This led to members breaking away to form their own political party, the Barisan Sosialis (Socialist Front) in 1961.21
Lee nonetheless plowed ahead, working out and negotiating a merger deal for Singapore. After a referendum in 1962,22 Singapore merged with Malaya on 16 September 1963, leading to the birth of Malaysia.23
The arrangement did not go down smoothly. In fact, the merger was marked by bouts of violence and riots.24 Among them, the Communal Riots of 1964 where Malays and Chinese clashed. On paper, the merger sought to bring the land masses together, on the ground however, communities were being ripped apart at their seams.25
The merger also resulted in rather intense friction between the leaders of both territories. On 9 August 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia.26 In a televised press conference the same day, Lee shed tears in what came to be known as his moment of anguish.
Merdeka! Merdeka!
Singapore's transition from merger to independence or merdeka in Malay, was relatively smooth as a result of careful planning on the part of Lee and his handpicked team.
Lee was also generally cautious about who he picked to serve in ministerial capacities. Based on their strengths, he placed Goh in charge of defence27, S. Rajaratnam on foreign affairs28, and Ong Pang Boon on education matters.29

A lasting legacy
After the setback of separation, Lee charged full-speed ahead to secure the future of the young nation.

Some of his wins included successfully locking down Singapore's long term supply of water from Malaysia,30 and transforming the republic into a lush, garden city through islandwide tree-planting efforts.31
Along the way, Lee set aside liberal experiments, prioritising growth, safety, security and equality instead.32

Image from National Archives of Singapore)
From as early as the 1970s, Lee began planning for the future government of Singapore by recruiting and grooming new talent. In 1990, Lee stepped down as prime minister, nominating Goh Chok Tong to take his place.33
Lee Kuan Yew, who took on the role of Senior Minister when he stepped down in 1990, is seen taking an oath as a Member of Parliament during the first session of the Ninth Parliament at Parliament House. (c.1997. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Lee remained in politics as Senior Minister, then as Minister Mentor in 2004 when his son Lee Hsien Long became prime minister. Both the older Lee as well as Goh left the cabinet on 14 May 2011, marking a new chapter in Singapore's political history.34

The nation is his legacy
Lee's work for the country has been commemorated through various tributes, such as the establishment of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in 2004, and the creation of the Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship by the Public Service Commission.
For his contributions, Lee has been commemorated in various ways. For instance, the Public Service Commission's Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship was set up in 1991.35 In 2004, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy was established.36
Lee Kuan Yew passed away at 3:18 am on 23 March 2015 at the age of 91.37 A week of national mourning and a state funeral was held.38 His legacy â€“ a sovereign nation that was safe, prosperous, and stable, and where millions continue to call home â€“ Singapore.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
The story of museums in Singapore begins with the Raffles Museum. Initiated by Raffles himself in 1823, and established in 1874 as part of a joint Raffles Library and Museum before it moved to its present Stamford Road premises in 1887, its purpose was to acquire specimens from and undertake research into Peninsular Malaya's wealth of natural history, ethnology, and archaeology. The British believed that knowledge was power. As such, the establishment of a museum to document and research colonial territory was part and parcel of the British colonial effort, and a physical symbol of British sovereignty over alien lands. The museum's predecessors included the Indian Museum in Calcutta and today's National Museum of Indonesia, established by the Dutch, but briefly under Raffles' supervision during an interregnum from 1811 to 1815 when Java was ruled by the British.

The Raffles Museum lost both its original purpose of being the collecting institution of the colonial apparatus and its collecting hinterland of Peninsular Malaya after Singapore attained self-government in 1959. Renamed the National Museum a year later, in 1960, it continued to flounder for the next few decades; critical questions as to what its role would be in the new nation were never satisfactorily answered. Management of the museum shifted from the Ministry of Culture to the Ministry of Science and Technology, and back again in 1972. With the latter shift, its natural history collections were excised and transferred to a brand new Singapore Science Centre and to the then-university of Singapore, where they still remain today and form the basis of the new Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. In place of its natural history displays, the National Museum introduced a new gallery dedicated to art from Singapore and the region.

It was not until the mid-1980s that the Government finally decided that it was necessary to address the National Museum's long-term role in Singapore. A high-level Task Force on the Long-term Development of the Museum (also known as the Museum Development Committee, or MDC) was appointed by the Government to look into this. Almost concurrently, a larger Advisory Council for Culture and the Arts (ACCA) was initiated by then-Second Deputy Prime Minister, the late Dr Ong Teng Cheong. The ACCA's mission was to review Singapore's entire cultural landscape, and to propose a comprehensive strategy that would boost the island's cultural vibrancy and preserve its heritage. Dr Ong wanted to turn around popular notions that Singapore was a â€œcultural desertâ€.
The recommendations of the MDC were eventually packaged as part of the slate of recommendations announced by the ACCA in 1989. Chief among the recommendations was a proposal to split the museum into five major standalone galleries: a Fine Arts Gallery, a Southeast Asian Natural History/Ethnology Gallery, a Singapore History Gallery, a Community Gallery, and a Children's Museum. These galleries would be located in a â€œNational Museum Precinctâ€ centred around Fort Canning Hill and Bras Basah.
The motivation behind this proposal was the recognition that it was vital for Singapore's continued economic success to engender in Singaporeans a deep understanding of the cultures and ways of living in the Southeast Asian region and in Singapore. Singapore's increasingly cosmopolitan nature also made critical a deeper historical, cultural, and sociological exploration of Singapore society and identity. Moreover, the committee agreed that the existing museum premises were not large enough to accommodate works for all the new galleries, and that there was a need to expand significantly.
The recommendations of the ACCA were collectively implemented in the 1990s, first with the renaming of the National Museum as the Singapore History Museum in 1993. Subsequently, the Singapore Art Museum was established in 1996, at the former Saint Joseph's Institution campus and so was the first wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum, in 1997 at the former Tao Nan School. Two other major developments took place during the same period â€” the first was the merging of the National Museum, the National Archives, and the Oral History Centre into the National Heritage Board (NHB) in 1993, charged to oversee the implementation of recommendations made by the ACCA pertaining to museums and cultural heritage. The second was the formation of the Museum Roundtable three years later, in 1996 â€” a loose association, or â€œcoming togetherâ€ of existing museums and public art galleries in Singapore. Today, the Museum Roundtable has grown organically to more than 50 members, including the National Museums, and other popular and established museums, such as the National University of Singapore Museum, the Science Centre, the Singapore Discovery Centre, the Changi Chapel and Museum, and the recently opened Art Science Museum at Marina Bay Sands.
The millennial decade saw an adrenaline-fuelled flurry of new developments in the museum landscape because of the Renaissance City Masterplans, which led to an emergence of a â€œbusiness of museumsâ€. This change was characterised by two paradigm shifts: the first was a recognition that museums â€” and the arts â€” were critical to urban vibrancy and quality of life, and thus an asset Singapore had to invest in in order to attract new businesses and talent; the second was to recognise museums as an industry in its own right, requiring strategies for the development of specialised capabilities such as curatorship, audience development, and object conservation.
There was a level of activity in the museum landscape never before seen â€” within the space of 10 years between 2000 to 2009, no less than 12 major museum-related milestones were achieved. These included the establishment of the Peranakan Museum, 8Q at Singapore Art Museum, and the Heritage Conservation Centre; the re-opening of the revamped National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum at Empress Place; the announcements of the proposed new National Gallery of Singapore and Indian Heritage Centre; the inaugural Singapore Biennale and Singapore Night Festival; and finally, Singapore's participation for the first time in the prestigious Venice Biennale.
The Heritage Conservation Centre opened in 2000
The Peranakan Museum opened in 2008
Every year during this 10-year period, Singaporeans were treated to two to three high-profile â€œblockbusterâ€ exhibitions imported from major international museums including the British Museum, the Vatican Museum, the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City, and the MusÃ©e du Louvre in Paris; or exhibitions that featured major artists and prestigious private collections in Singapore and the region. These exhibitions included China Art NOW! at the Singapore Art Museum in 2001, Journey of Faith: Art & History from the Vatican Collections at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2005, Greek Masterpieces from the Louvre at the National Museum of Singapore in 2008 and The Kangxi Emperor, Treasures from the Forbidden City at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2009. These blockbusters were often accompanied by two to three smaller, â€œboutiqueâ€ exhibitions that presented Singaporean art, history, and popular culture, and explored Singapore's role as a crossroads of art, cultures, and ideas across Asia. One such example was the Beauty in Asia exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2009, which saw the museum taking on Asia in its entirety through the medium of a single question: â€œWhat is Beauty?â€. These efforts to partner regional and international counterparts as well as explore Singapore's own culture and heritage established the museums as destinations in their own right â€” visitorship to the National Museums went from a few hundred thousand in the early 2000s to more than 2 million annually by the end of the decade. Total visitorship to museums in the Museum Roundtable went past the 8-million mark by the 2010s.

Terracotta Warriors: The First Emperor and his Legacy at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2011.

Looking ahead, the future looks rosy for museums in Singapore. In 2013, entry to National Museums was made free for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, resulting in museum visitorship figures crossing the 3-million mark that year. 2014 saw major gifts amounting to over $50 million in cash and in-kind sponsorship to the National Gallery of Singapore, as well as $46 million raised for the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Finally, 2015 had four new museums opening â€” the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, the Indian Heritage Centre, the privately-run Singapore PinacothÃ¨que de Paris, and the long-awaited National Gallery of Singapore. Concurrently, the National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum were also undergoing major gallery revamps and re-opened their doors at the end of the year. In the meantime, the Singapore Botanic Gardens had also just been successfully inscribed as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site. All in all, there will be very vibrant and rich cultural heritage experiences for the general public in the years to come.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Rosalind-Tan-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"When Rosalind Tan was growing up, her mother would speak to her and the rest of the family, only in Malay. Baba Malay to be exact.
This baffled her. She looked Chinese, had Chinese ancestry but did not have a Chinese name.That simple act fuelled an interest in her origins.
Rosalind is Peranakan Chinese. â€œI come from an ethnic culture that not many people know about. Most people take it that you're half Malay and half Chinese, period. That's the most that they know,â€ she says.
She would learn that her ancestors, who were from China, arrived in the Straits of Malacca in the 19th century and married local women.
Religion was not on the forefront of these women's minds. They were more concerned about basic needs such as food, shelter and clothing â€” so they took on the religion of their husbands. As a result, Peranakan Chinese are not Muslims, and pork is a regular feature in their cuisine.
Her roots were very much alive at home. Rosalind 's mother came from Malacca, had Hokkien roots but spoke only Baba Malay, while her father was ethnically Chinese. His first wife only bore him two daughters after twelve years of marriage. Because sons were valued in Peranakan culture, he decided to take on a second wife.
â€œ'My father was an Anglophile - the â€œKing's Chineseâ€ as they were referred to then. His children would take the names of English kings and queens. My mother bore him eight sons and six daughters.â€ adds Rosalind. â€œGoing by her lineage, I am fifth-generation Peranakan. My children are sixth and my grandchildren are seventh.â€
Starting early
Her passion for volunteering began in secondary school. Rosalind started a social service club, which regularly visited childrens' and nursing homes.
She later fundraised for the National Council of Social Service and was awarded the Special Volunteer Award. She has also been an air stewardess, worked in hotel management and real estate.
Rosalind retired at age 55. At that point, volunteering seemed like a natural next step. The Peranakan Museum had opened that year, just as she was entertaining the idea of becoming a docent.
A visit to the museum sealed the deal. On display was an artefact: a Catholic altar with carvings of the phoenix and qilins.
â€œI nearly fainted. I saw an artefact that once belonged to my family. I recognised it because I had seen it from afar, from the main door (of the home of my father's first wife),â€ she recalls. â€œI couldn't believe it so I brought some family members there. And, they said yes, it's the one.â€
Looking back, she reflects, â€œI believed that I could add value to the museum. Plus, I was looking to contribute to society in the space of arts and culture, and better still, in the promotion of an ethnic culture which even my own ethnic group don't know much about.â€
Rosalind started training to be a docent in 2009. A year later, she was appointed co-head, and her responsibilities included training new docents.
Reaching out
In 2010, Rosalind mooted the idea of tours for the elderly in Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese dialects and the Malay language at The Peranakan Museum.
Although there were requests for Mandarin tours at that time, she didn't speak the language, and wanted to present them with alternatives.
The tours were a hit. The museum would host a group of eight to ten seniors once every two months. As time went on, the tours were held twice a month.
Elderly visitors loved the mock-up of an old kitchen, which was on display at the museum, and often shared their own stories of earlier times. Those who lived on Pulau Ubin would share that they reared chicken and ducks for a living. To get running water, they needed to pay 50 cents for the installation of water pipes, said Rosalind.
Then, the Alzheimer's Disease Association (ADA) wanted to take persons with dementia to the museum, as part of their therapy. Collaborating with The Peranakan Museum, ADA conducted a typographical survey in 2011, to ensure that it would be a safe environment. The route needed to be wheelchair-friendly and bright.
Rosalind also visited the association's New Horizon Centres with other docents. They found out more about its programmes for persons with dementia, which included arts and craft. They then decided that their museum tours for ADA's clients would include the porcelain and kebaya galleries, to draw connections to familiar colours and patterns. Elderly visitors were also served tea with red dates before tours, to put them at ease.
â€œWe are not trained medical personnel, so we needed to be very sensitive to how they would react to a new place. I think being friendly, warm and approachable is very important,â€ Rosalind says.
New horizons
ADA tours have since expanded to the National Museum of Singapore, with the launching of â€œMemories Cafeâ€ in 2018. Held on Saturdays for persons with dementia and their caregivers, they visit two galleries which touch on Singapore in the 1950s, after a meal at the â€œFood for Thoughtâ€ cafe.

When I was asked to write this article, I was told to focus on the natural history collection1 of the former Raffles Museum and how they showcase a different aspect of Singapore's (and the region's) heritage. At this point, I must confess that I am no specialist in the field of natural history or biodiversity. However, as a student of museology, I have taken the liberty of expanding my topic to include the roles of collectors â€“ both institutional and individual â€“ and how they have contributed in building the Raffles Library & Museum's natural history collection.
Through archival notes and published materials, this article will share stories behind how some specimens were found, the key personalities involved in the collection and why they have collected these specimens. On a larger context, the article also looks into the history of collecting as a natural form of human activity and it will end by examining the importance of a natural history collection today.
From Cabinet of Curious to Natural History of Collection
During the Renaissance period that emerged in the early 16th century, there began to appear â€“ initially in European courts â€“ collections of a special type, known as kunstkammer or cabinet of curiosities. The term literally refers to a â€˜cabinet' or a room filled with various types of â€˜curios' (objects) whose categorical boundaries were yet to be defined. These collections included antiquities, works of art, scientific instruments, books, paintings, religious or historical relics, exotic items from faraway lands and particularly natural history specimens. The historian, Irmgard Musch has commented that the aim was to bring together â€“ at least in representative form â€“ the most complete collection possible of all things knowable and worth knowing, to record them and thus to make them easier to grasp2.
Famous owners of cabinets of curiosities included Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria, Munich (1528-1579); Flemish physician Samuel van Quiccheberg (1529-1567); Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria (1529- 1595); Grand Duke of Tuscany, Francesco I de' Medici (1541-1587); Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II (1552-1612); Danish physician Ole Worm (1588-1655); and Dutch pharmacist Albertus Seba (1665- 1736). Most of their collections laid the foundation of European museums today. In assembling their collections, these men were actually following a trend of their time.
The Renaissance was also known as the age of discovery as several nations and peoples engaged in intensive explorations of the world. In each voyage, new geographical and scientific findings were made and the ideal cabinet of curiosities defined an attempt to produce an overall and encyclopaedic picture of this world, the cosmos. However, this cosmological view of the world began to lose importance after 1600. In the 17th and 18th centuries, cabinets of curiosities were replaced by more specialised collections often triggered by scholarly curiosity based on scientific â€˜objective' principles. The new aim was less to reflect, in representative samples, the whole cosmos than to cover comprehensively a chosen area of speciality. Through description, comparison and ordering of their pieces, collectors strove to reach an empirical and scientific understanding of nature. It was even considered as a duty of every educated person to watch and study the time in which he lives and to participate in collecting natural history specimens or objects from foreign material cultures.
From the 18th century onwards, Europeans were increasingly interested in nature and societies beyond the Western world. This led to the establishment of academic societies, such as the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (1778) and the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1784), whose activities included the study of natural history, people and their material cultures. These institutions often encouraged laymen to collect for the sake of science and to share their research and donate their collections.
By the mid 19th century, riding on the expansion of colonial empires, European and American collectors were making their way to Southeast Asia in search of exotic plants, animal specimens and ethnographic objects. Scientists, voyagers, entrepreneurs and amateur collectors played an important role in building the large natural history and ethnographic collections of museums around the world. There were motivations enough for collecting â€“ whether to act as an intellectual stimulus, to satisfy an investigating spirit, or to display wealth and erudition. And of course, collections owned or donated to academic institutions also raised the social prestige of their owners. Natural history museums, which evolved from cabinets of curiosities, also played an important role in the emergence of biological and environmental studies.
The birth of the Raffles Library & Museum
To bring this long museological tradition into the local context, Singapore's oldest museum owes its birth to an eminent British colonial administrator, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781-1826), who was also a passionate naturalist and collector of natural history specimens. Raffles' interests in natural history are well known, culminating in his founding of the Zoological Society of London in 1826, from which arose the London Zoo. Before he set foot in Singapore, he pursued these interests during his career in Penang, Malacca, Java and Sumatra. His own scientific interests were largely zoological and later he collected all things Javanese.
Raffles' History of Java (1817) is an amazing assortment of miscellaneous knowledge. Writing to his friend, Dr Thomas Horsfield, (1773 - 1859) an American physician and naturalist, he constantly mentioned his latest finds and informed Horsfield of the shipping of his collections back to London. He wrote:
""Among my baggage and collections sent home by the Borneo are a few cases of animals (not very important but some new) and two cases of insects belonging to Lady R. If you would occasionally look at the latter it may be useful & my friend Mr. Evans to whose care they are consigned will gladly transfer them to you if you will under-take the charge â€“ there is also a case or two of snakes and 5 barrels of animals in spirit â€“ none however important â€“ one contains the Bornean Orang Ootan4...""
Raffles' letters reveal that he was a man of omnivorous learning but had little time, with an 18th century faith that believed it is possible to learn everything4. It was he who, in 1823, proposed setting up a museum and library in Singapore as a repository for specimens deemed relevant to the flora, fauna and peoples of the region. In another letter to Dr. Horsfield, he mentioned that:
""I am at present engaged in founding an institution at Singapore for the cultivation of the Chinese, Siamese and Malayan languages & the moral & intellectual improvement of the natives, in which there will be separate department for scientific purposes including a professor of natural history â€“ as patron and founder of this institution I shall have to form a committee or corporation in Europe & we shall then have the means of at all times collecting information regarding these countries â€“ the particulars I will hereafter send you when they are printed â€“ I am glad to see your botanical collections are so well arranged and that you so soon propose publishing5.""
Unfortunately, Raffles left Singapore the same year and it was not until 1849 that the institution â€“ named in his honour â€“ was established by the committee of the Singapore Institution (present-day Raffles Institution). After several relocations, the Raffles Library & Museum finally found a home at Stamford Road and was officially opened on 12 October 1887.

Collectors and Curators: Charting the Specimens of the Raffles Museum
The Raffles Library & Museum was established in a period when the rise of disciplines such as anthropology and archaeology coincided with the expansion of colonial empires. Natural history was still the dominant discipline and took centre stage in the Raffles Library & Museum (RLM). Until its renaming as the National Museum in 1969, the RLM had established itself as a well-known scientific institution with a particularly comprehensive zoological collection. Almost all its curators were specialists in natural history6. In contrast, most of the ethnological materials acquired in the early years of the museum were haphazardly acquired with sketchy records and little information on the objects.

In 1893, RLM curator Dr Karl Hanitsch (1860-1940) reported the need for more systematic collecting with clear objectives and accurate documentation, as these were evidently lacking at the time. However, due to various other complications such as limited funds, manpower and storage space, the museum continued to rely on ad hoc donations and purchases whenever the opportunity arose.
One of the earliest attempts to systematically collect objects was in September 1924. Then RLM director, Cecil Boden Kloss (1877-1949), along with his assistant, N. Smedleyand Dr. H.H. Karny, Assistant Entomologist of the Zoological Museum in Buitenzorg (present day Bogor) in Java, organised an expedition to the Mentawai islands off the west coast of Sumatra. The expedition included 12 â€˜native' assistants who did most of the work â€“ catching insects, trapping animals and gathering samples of plants and seeds. Among them was a Malay plant collector from the Botanical Gardens in Singapore and a number of Karny's assistants from Java. Together, they spent two months on the islands gathering over 1,500 specimens. Most of these were natural history specimens now housed now in the collections of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research at the National University of Singapore. Among the items collected were about 150 ethnological objects which eventually came to the Asian Civilisations Museum. This small but significant collection of objects remains largely intact today. The majority of the pieces collected are everyday items of local manufacture: hats, containers, tools and weapons.

The museum's Annual Report (1926) mentions that three cases of ethnological objects gathered by the expedition were put on display in the galleries and at least 23 monographs were published on the natural history specimens gathered through the Bulletins of the Raf es Library & Museum. In his introduction to the Spolia Mentawiensia series, Kloss noted that the islands were not very pleasant collecting grounds7, describing them as mostly swamp with paths that were often impassable owing to oods. Moreover, in spite of systematic employment of quinine and other precautions, all the members of the party except himself contracted malaria. Kloss added that the expedition enjoyed the protection of a military escort although this was â€˜happily largely unnecessary'.
Building a Regional Network
The Raffles Museum curators continued to build up the collection by organising expeditions around Southeast Asia â€“ often jointly with staff from the Selangor Museum and Perak Museum.
Thus a large number of specimens were acquired and deposited at the Raffles Museum. The Raffles Museum also conducted specimen exchange programmes with other institutions in Malaya, Indonesia, England, America, the Netherlands and India. One of the most significant exchanges was arranged in 1926 by H. C. Robinson, then director of the Federated Malay States Museums. He sent the bird and mammal collections of the Selangor Museum in return for the Raffles Museum's insect collection.
Aside from the staff's tireless collecting activities, many individual collectors have also contributed to the museum's collection. William Louis Abbott (1860-1936), a native of Philadelphia, was considered as one of America's greatest naturalists. In 1899, Abbott commissioned the construction of a 65-foot schooner, The Terrapin, in Singapore. Over the next 10 years, he visited almost all of the Southeast Asia island groups on The Terrapin. After each expedition, Abbott would return to Singapore to have his collections shipped off to Washington, D.C. He donated over 6,000 objects to the Smithsonian Institution, most of which were zoological specimens. A small portion of his collection was donated to the Raffles Library & Museum. Many were collected in collaboration with Kloss. Today, most of Abbott's zoological collection remains intact in the Smithsonian and the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR), Singapore. A group of proboscis monkeys from West Kalimantan, Indonesia and a Malaysian Giant Terrapin donated by Abbott in 1905 and 1907 respectively are still on display in the RMBR gallery. These specimens were borrowed in 2009 for display at Hunters & Collectors â€“ the Origins of the Southeast Asian collection, a special exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum.

Another prominent individual who contributed to the Raffles Museum's zoological collection was Tom Harrisson (1911-1976), a British polymath and then Director of Sarawak Museum from 1947-1966. His friendship with the then director of the Raffles Museum, Michael Tweedie, fostered many working opportunities between the two museums. It was recorded in the Raffles Museum's Annual Report that he brought a large collection of over 900 bird skins from the Kelabit Plateau in the interior of Sarawak8. Both Harrisson and Tweedie made a preliminary examination of the collection and drafted a report on this. It is unknown, however, if this report was ever published.
Anonymous Assistants
There is another class of unsung heroes who helped to build the museum's collection. They were usually local assistants hired by collectors during their expeditions. Using local assistants was extremely important for both institutional and individual collectors. They acted as guides to the unfamiliar terrains and as interpreters to language and cultural barriers. This fact is often undermined or even neglected in return for a more objective scientific report or a more romantic and adventurous account by collectors in those days. Tweedie made a gratuitous note with regards to hiring local assistants and their contribution in the museum work.
""When I arrived in Singapore in 1932 to fill the post of Assistant Curator, zoological collecting and taxonomy was the museum's main activity, but its scope was limited. The retiring Director Cecil Boden Kloss and his successor F.N. Chasen interested themselves solely in mammals and birds. The Curator, N. Smedley, who retired at the same time as Boden Kloss, had concerned himself mainly with the museum's collection of reptiles. Entomology was covered by H.M. Pendlebury at the museum at Kuala Lumpur. So I had care of the reptiles, the fish and all of the invertebrates.

The collectors on the staff were Ibans from Sarawak, intelligent, energetic men and born naturalists. They and I would go together sometimes on day excursions, sometimes camping for a week or more, and they were soon far more adept at finding centipedes, scorpions and the like than I was. Under their patient and sympathetic tuition my Malay vocabulary steadily progressed9.""
The encounters between the local assistants and collectors also included many interesting stories. In an expedition to the Batu Puteh and Ulu Batang Padang Mountains in Perak, Cecil Wray, a Pahang Resident of the State Council, reported of a strange creature that lurked the area. He wrote:
""Later on we again heard the Datoh exhorting the Sakeis to be vigilant during the night; we could not understand why, but on inquiry, were told that on this mountain lives a peculiar animal, which prowls about at night: the body is that of a rhinoceros, but it has the head of a tiger. We were particularly told if one should visit the camp not to look at it, for it always chased and tried to kill anyone who looked at it, whereas if no notice was taken it passed on quietly. The Penghulu assured us that lots of people had seen this curious beast and many had been chased.10""
A blend of Science and Artistic Skills
Collecting natural history specimens might appear to be fun and exciting on the surface but it has practical problems as well. Storage space and conservation matters are usually the main concerns when it comes to natural history collections even today. While fossils, seashells and bones were not subject to major decay, other natural specimens require complex conservation measures.
Curators and specialists had to have basic knowledge of other relevant disciplines such as medicine and taxidermy. Aside from publishing scientific reports, curators also published guidebooks to assist amateurs and special interests groups. Cecil Boden Kloss, himself a well-known taxidermist, wrote an instruction manual for preparing mammal skins11.
Publications formed a part of every natural history collection and also served as commentaries on them. Kloss understood the importance of publications and had hence started the Bulletins of the Raffles Museum, which provided access to specialised subject matter and enabled readers to debate and acknowledge the work produced by the museum curators. The Bulletins quickly became one of the premier scholarly journals in its time, publishing many important papers on Southeast Asian zoology. The illustrations in the Bulletins also served to supplement collection of natural specimens, closing any gaps and making up for any deficiencies with pictures. Illustrations of the specimens could act as a substitute or supplement for specimens that were difficult to preserve or only partially collected.
However, to produce an illustration of a specimen is not an easy task. Musch has commented that â€œwhen a collector or naturalist commissioned an artist to draw specimens of interests to him, and in a second stage even to transfer them onto a plate for the press, the plant or animal in question underwent considerable abstraction and distillation on its way to becoming a scientific illustration12.â€ Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill, Director of the Raffles Museum (1911-1963) was known to act as both naturalist and artist.
It is also interesting to note that he liked to make his own drawings in pen and ink, choosing not to rely on the Museum's resident artist. He preferred to depict his subjects in black and white instead of colour for he noted that:
""[Colour illustrations] are pleasant to draw, but the blocks are expensive (for publishing), and they are frequently not as helpful as many beginners (bird watchers) imagine them to be. Black and white work places the emphasis on the arrangement of light and dark tones in the plumage. This is far more constant under varying climatic conditions than the colour itself13.""

We can see from Gibson-Hill's illustrations that a specimen was regarded as a representative of its species and its appearance was systematised. In most natural history illustrations, individual traits not typical of the subject's kind were minimised and the scientifically significant ones were accentuated. The elements important for human identification of the specimens are better rendered and considerably clearer in the picture than in the actual specimen itself. Musch commented that this pictorial abstraction technique applied by artists of natural history illustrations may also be understood as one way of taming the multifariousness of nature14.
The natural history collection enjoyed its prominence until 1969 where its fate took a sudden turn for the worse. The Raffles Museum was renamed the National Museum and new directions were set for the institution to cater for arts, history and anthropology. The natural history collection was moved out to the Singapore Science Centre and was later transferred to the University of Singapore's Bukit Timah campus and the collection became known as the Zoological Reference Collection in 1972. However due to space constraints and bad storage conditions, some specimens were damaged and it took a tremendous effort by the curators to prevent more losses. In 1986, the collection finally got a permanent home in the Kent Ridge campus of the National University of Singapore. Two years later, the university decided that the time was ripe to establish a research centre for biodiversity and hence oversaw the birth of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research.
A Race Against Time: Preserving and Presenting Natural History Collections for the Future
Today, the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR), renamed the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (LCKNHM) on 1st April 2014, has well-representd collections of animals - some of which are among the best in the world. At the time of writing, the LCKNHM had around 566,500 specimens16. Most of these items are irreplaceable, priceless and historically significant specimens.
Among the museum's mammal collection, the primates (a taxonomical group that includes monkeys and apes) which total 867 catalogued specimens are probably the best represented. The LCKNHM also has large collections of rats, squirrels and bats. The mammal collection had 315 species and around 15,000 specimens in 2010.
The LCKNHM is also one of the finest reference museums for Southeast Asian birds, with approximately 1,060 species and some 31,000 specimens in 2010, including a fine collection of eggs and nests. Even with legal constraints on bird collecting, a few good specimens are still donated from time to time by members of the public nowadays. These are usually casualties of the migratory season.
In 2010, there were about 70,000 specimens in the RMBR's entomological collection. While many specimens are mounted on pins, others are preserved in vials of alcohol. Microscopic taxa like mites are mainly mounted on glass slides. All entomological specimens have been sorted according to their various taxonomic levels.
At an international level, despite of their ever-growing importance, natural history collections, like most other aspects of the museum world, are suffering from a serious decline in resources16. Along with the wider impacts of globalisation and economic inflation, most museums today are under serious budget constraints, inadequate funding, declining numbers of trained professionals and lack of young people who want to work in museums. It was reported that the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., lost 30 federal scientist positions in the last decade17.
The challenge of future museums lies on how these institutions manage to find ways of continuing to develop the research potential of their collections while learning how to live with reduced resources. In Owen's report, Robert Gropp, a representative of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) commented that natural history collections are bleeding slowly. Many museums are losing staff positions due to cuts to their operating budget. Gropp predicts that slowly but surely they will lose resources until an administrator determine that it is best to close the facility18. These implications have resulted scientists and curators working in a museum in a race against time.
To make matters worse for natural history museums, the world is in the grip of a biodiversity crisis. Keith Thomson, an Emeritus Professor of Natural History at Oxford University, has warned that â€œas the whole ecosystems continue to be lost because of human activities, the need for natural history collections is more important than ever. These collections provide essential research in the biological sciences; serves as a vast library about what organisms have lived and are living on Earth; and contribute to public education in an easily accessible venue19.â€
Research in biodiversity is of particular urgency. Professor Peter Ng, Director of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, has remarked that â€œSoutheast Asia is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, though it has received much less attention compared to the Amazon, West Africa and the Great Barrier Reef. But how can we protect the diversity of this region if we do not conduct the necessary research to understand it in the first place20?â€
With natural history museums in Washington, New York and London drawing millions of visitors each year, there was demand from both the public and scientists of this region for a proper natural history museum in Singapore. Commentators and letter writers to the newspapers noted that the premises of the RMBR in 2010 did not allow it to realise its full potential in education and research21. The museum received tremendous public support since media reports highlighted its vast but little-known collection. This call for a new facility was heard from an undisclosed member of the public who pledged S$10 million for a natural history museum22. The plan to build a new natural history museum in Singapore was fulfilled with the building of the LCKNHM, a museum and research facility, which was opened to the public on April 18, 2015. It aims to be the focal point for regional biodiversity research and education and it is accessible to other universities, national agencies and nature lovers.
The modern museum is a constantly evolving entity. Julian Spalding, a former director of the Glasgow Museums, has observed that museums â€œwill continue to have a duty to accumulate knowledge, but their authority will be based more in the future on their openness towards and commitment to learning, not on the weight of their knowledge to date23.â€ Given today's technological advancement, anyone with access to the Internet can obtain or claim any required form of information. Hence, museums would have a better chance of captivating the attention of a wider audience if they used as their starting point the ignorance we have all shared, and must share. In other words, museums need to preserve the past not merely for nostalgic reasons.
Nostalgia is personal; it dies with each individual and generation. The past only merits preservation if it has something to teach the public of today. Museums are about learning through looking. Hence, it is the museum's job to make its collections meaningful to audiences. Modern museums have to find more dynamic ways of integrating the public with the research functions of collections. Natural history collections do not just mirror the planet's biodiversity â€“ they help to sustain it. For many museum visitors, the countless rows of stuffed or pickled specimens on display in the galleries are a reminder of what's at stake.
Selected timeline of the Raffles Library and Museum
1823 â€“ Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Dr Robert Morrison (1782-1834) come up with the idea of a scientific institution devoted to the study of natural history and history of the islands of the Malay Archipelago. Raffles departs for Bencoolen (present day Bengkulu, Sumatra) on 9 June. Work plans for the scientific institution are handed over to a board of trustees to oversee the project.
1827 â€“ The institution building, known as the Singapore Institution, is erected but stands vacant for eight years.
1837 â€“ The school library begins to build its collection of books. The management committee contemplates the formation of a museum in connection with the library.
1849 â€“ The museum slowly begins to take shape. The Library receives an official gift of two gold coins from the Temenggong of Johore, presented by Governor Colonel W.J. Butterworth, who supports the management committee in pressing for the establishment of a museum.
1850 â€“ The management committee reports that the museum is a valuable addition to the library and gradually sees a series of official gifts from neighbouring government officials. The Straits Settlements government announces the museum's participation in the Great Exhibition in London the following year.
1851 â€“ The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations is held in London. It is the first in a series of World's Fair exhibitions of culture and industry.
1873 â€“ Singapore participates in the Permanent Exhibition of Colonial Products in South Kensington, UK. Formal paperwork is put through for the establishment of the Raffles Library and Museum.
1874 â€“ The Raffles Library and Museum (RLM) opens its doors to the public. The first Annual Report of the RLM is published. Issues reported frequently over the next century are: lack of space, lack of proper accommodation and too much work for the curator-cum-librarian.
1881 â€“ Growing interest from the public and scientific society at large towards the library and museum. Scientists passing through Singapore begin to visit the museum and zoological specimens are sent for identification by experts.
1882 â€“ After several relocations, the RLM is shifted to the foot of Fort Canning at Stamford Road.
1887 â€“ The museum is officially opened on 12 October 1887 by Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements.
1895 â€“ Entomologist Dr Karl Richard Hanitsch (directorship 1908â€“19) appointed Curator and Librarian of the RLM. His principal research is in entomology (the study of insects), but he also works on other natural history specimens such as sponges, birds, amphibians and mammals. A large part of his publication is on insects, in particularly, cockroaches. Hanitsch becomes director in 1908 and holds the position for eleven years. During his tenure, RLM's zoological collection prospers from expeditions around the region. The ethnological collection is also enhanced by donations and acquisitions from Agricultural Trade Shows around the region. Before his retirement, Hanitsch starts a collection of portraits, plans and pictures of old Singapore to celebrate the centenary of the founding of Singapore by Raffles.
1902 â€“ Valentine Knight joins as assistant curator and taxidermist for the zoological collection, a post he holds till 1921. He is responsible for many taxidermy masterpieces during his service.
1911 â€“ Growing interest in the museum from the local communities. In 1908, the museum sees over 10,500 visitors over the two-day Chinese New Year holiday and by 1918, some 17,472 visitors pass through the galleries.
1919 â€“ Entomologist John Coney Moultan (directorship 1919- 23) succeeds Dr Hanitsch as director. He was Curator of the Sarawak Museum (1909-15) and founding editor of the Sarawak Museum Journal. Moultan reorganises the natural history collection, giving the insect collection a proper display and reviews the chaotic and haphazardly arranged ethnological and archaeological collections. Moultan emphasises the museum's educational role and plans a series of guides to the different sections of the zoological collections. He resigns in 1923 to become Chief Secretary to the Government of Sarawak.
1921 â€“ Frederick Nutter Chasen appointed assistant curator to take over from the retiring Valentine Knight. Chasen has a strong interest in birds and museum work.
1923 â€“ Zoologist Cecil Boden Kloss (directorship 1923â€“32) takes over directorship from Moultan. In the early 1900s, Kloss travelled with American naturalist William Louis Abbott to the Andaman and Nicobar islands. He also worked under Herbert C. Robinson, Director of the Federated Malay States Museums. Kloss and Chasen make a strong team: they established the museum's zoological collection and boost the quality of research. Kloss retires in 1932, remembered as an ardent collector, skilful taxidermist, fine shot and a first class photographer.
1924 â€“ Kloss and staff of RLM conduct the first systematic collecting expedition on material culture specimens from the Mentawai islands.
1928 â€“ Kloss produces the Bulletin of the Raffl",Roots Website,Learning Through Looking The Natural History Collection Of The Former Raffles Library And Museum

Singapore prides itself on its multicultural society and the resultant cultural diversity that such a multi-ethnic social landscape produces. Nonetheless, historical official categories of â€˜race' and â€˜ethnicity' in singapore have tended to gloss over the rich heritage and cultural practices unique to sub-ethnic groups within the larger ethnic â€˜wholes'. Hence ethnic categories such as â€˜Chinese', â€˜Malay' and â€˜Indian' may only scratch the surface of cultural communities that are in fact far more complex, with myriad histories and customs, despite some shared religious practices and languages.
In that respect â€˜Malay' sometimes becomes a convenient administrative â€˜shorthand' â€“ a catch-all term that belies the various origins and social histories of the Malayo-Polynesian communities of Southeast Asia, communities which include diverse groups such as the Baweanese, the Javanese, the Minang, the Bugis, the Banjarese and the Mandailings. For centuries, these peoples voyaged back and forth across what historian Leonard Andaya has termed the â€˜Sea of Melayu' and many of them, especially the Baweanese, came to settle in Singapore during the period of European colonialism in the 19th-20th centuries.
On 15 March 2014, the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC) launched its first-ever community co-curated exhibition, LaaobeChanging Times: Baweanese Heritage & Culture in Singapore (Laaobe: Warisan & Budaya Bawean di Singapura). The exhibition, which featured the Baweanese community in Singapore, also marked the launch of the Se-Nusantara series. This is another exhibition put up annually that features a different sub-ethnic group of the Malays in Singapore. Each partner sub-ethnic cultural group will get to work together with MHC's curatorial experts to showcase their unique cultures and tell their diasporic histories of merantau (voyaging) across Southeast Asia, and how they ultimately came to compose the mosaic of Malay identities in Singapore.
Laaobe highlighted the Baweanese community in Singapore, whose forefathers hailed from Pulau Bawean, a small island located off the northeastern coast of Java. Laaobe, which means â€œchangedâ€, showcased the heritage and transformation of the local Baweanese community over the years, as shaped through various historical and socio-economic events.
The exhibition presented the history and development of Singapore's Baweanese people through over 40 objects and archival materials contributed by the community. Exhibits included rarely-seen personal collections of pictures of ponthuk life and daily objects found in Baweanese households, such as handwoven pandan mats and bags, and a high-footed bed frame popular with Malay families in the past.
Who are the Baweanese?
Narratives of diasporic communities usually revolve around several themes and milestones in their journey and experiences in their new homeland. They usually elaborate on the reasons the Baweans migrated to Singapore, factors that contributed to their migration patterns, and the impact of their migration on Singapore's cultural landscape. The exhibition sought to provide an insight to these topics and introduce both local and foreign visitors to the MHC to the vibrant Baweanese community in Singapore. The Baweanese originated from a small island called Pulau Bawean, which is located off the northeastern coast of Java in modern-day Indonesia. The inhabitants call themselves â€˜orang Phebiyen' or â€˜orang Bawean', speak â€˜Baweanese' and profess Islam as their faith. Here, they are more familiarly known as Orang Boyan (â€˜Bawean people', although â€˜Boyan' is a mispronunciation of â€˜Bawean').

Merantau and the Malay Diaspora in Souteast Asia
Merantau, the Baweanese cultural practice of temporarily migrating to distant lands in search of work opportunities and to better oneself, was one of the key factors that led to scores of young Baweanese men leaving their ancestral desa (villages) in search of their fate and fortunes. The majority did not have the intention to settle down permanently in the countries they visited. Their main motive was to make sufficient money to buy gold and other consumer goods, and ultimately to build a house in Bawean when they returned.
The Baweanese started migrating to Singapore in the 19th century and this movement further intensified in the early 20th century due to the vast economic opportunities available here. Colonial records show that Baweanese migrants were a formal ethnic category of Singapore's population in 1849, but given the active maritime movements criss-crossing Southeast Asia, it is highly likely that Baweans were already part of Singapore's social milieu as early as the turn of the 19th century. These early settlers provided much-needed services in the port areas, town centres and even recreational arenas. At the time, Bawean men were known for their horse-handling and motoring skills and many worked as horse syces, drivers and water-boat workers. Even though many of these Baweanese saw themselves as sojourners, most of them settled permanently due to the higher wages they could earn here as well as the increasingly restrictive colonial policies that prevented them from easily returning to Bawean.
Ponthuk Living
The Baweanese community of Singapore grew out of successive waves of migrants settling permanently here from the mid-19th century onwards. Many Baweanese settled at the bank of the Rochor River between Jalan Besar and Syed Alwi Road. Pre-war shophouses located around Kampong Kapor Road near Jalan Besar were turned into ponthuks, such as Pondok Diponggo, Pondok Kalompang Gubuk and Pondok Gelam.

The ponthuk (Malay: pondok), a communal residence based on village affiliations back on Bawean, became an important social institution for the Baweanese community in Singapore until the end of the 20th century. These ponthuks, in effect shophouse residences set in urban locations around Singapore, initially served as temporary homes for the Baweanese newcomers and provided them with safety and other welfare services â€“ a practice similar to the kongsi concept of Chinese clans. A newcomer lodged in the ponthuk until he had found employment and a permanent home usually provided by his employer.
As more Baweanese came to settle in Singapore and married locals or brought over their families, the ponthuk came to grow as a social institution that ensured the communal welfare of the Baweanese until they were financially able to set up their own home. It served not only as an institution that gave them a sense of socio-economic security but was also a micro-economic reflection of village relationships back on Bawean.

One of the highlights of the Laaobe exhibition was the depiction of life in a ponthuk during the mid-19th to late 20th century and the vivid presentation of community-contributed artefacts. The ponthuk representation gave visitors an insight into the living conditions of the Baweanese settlers and the communal activities that contributed to the beginnings of a community group known for being close-knit.
A Pak Lurah or residence master would head each ponthuk and serve as the leader of that household. The Baweanese are known for making group decisions by consensus, and general assemblies and other meetings usually took place in the living room of a ponthuk. Generally, this area was restricted to male ponthuk residents and guests only. A typical living room in a ponthuk had a huge multi-purpose ambin (a low raised platform) and a communal dining table. The ambin, which usually covered one-third of the floor area, served several purposes â€“ it could be used as a huge yet spartan bed for ponthuk bachelors, for daily solat (prayers) or even as a place where Qur'an recitations were performed.

Baweanese cultural norms and practices
Living in a close-knit ponthuk environment contributed to the formulation of cultural norms and practices within the Baweanese community in Singapore. These cultural norms, which are ill- practised today, include the concept of gotong-royong, or â€˜mutual aid'. Gotong-royong is a shared cultural value across the different Malay communities and the spirit of â€˜mutual aid' was embodied in ponthuk life. Ponthuk residents were expected to assist one another in good and bad times, and contribute financially to the household. Weddings, thanks-giving customs, newborn baby celebrations and funerals were affairs that concerned the entire ponthuk community. Ponthuk living also contributed to the formation of social groups such as the kendarat (a voluntary service during wedding occasions), kompang (a handheld drum ensemble), berzanji (a religious recitation group) and kercengan, a quintessential traditional Baweanese group performance that blends Quranic verses and Baweanese chorale music.

Persatuan Bawean Singapura (PBS)
Laaobe was produced in partnership with Persatuan Bawean Singapura (PBS - Singapore Baweanese Association), a social organisation formed in 1934 to assist and supervise all the ponthuks scattered all over the island at that time. Back then, PBS worked closely with the various ponthuks to help Singapore's newly arrived Baweanese migrants by providing shelter and sustenance as well as aid to secure employment.
After 1962, ponthuks started closing down as families began to move out into single-family residences. Although the ponthuk has disappeared from Singapore's urban landscape, PBS continues to play an important role in the context of Singapore's multi-ethnic cultural milieu by promoting the language and culture of the Baweanese community. The group also organises charity and community events nationally that involve the larger multi-ethnic Singapore community.

The Baweanese Community in Singapore today
The Baweanese today no longer live in ponthuks, but that has not diminished the community spirit of the people. The Baweanese word â€œlaaobeâ€ means â€œchangedâ€ and while transformation aptly describes the history of the Singapore Baweanese community over the decades, many aspects of Baweanese culture, heritage and values are still very much alive today.
The many programmes supporting the exhibition were also opportunities for both Singaporean and foreign visitors to learn more about the Baweanese culture as well as its delicious cuisine, and about how the community has enriched the extraordinary cultural landscape that we enjoy in Singapore.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 â€“ Jul to Sep 2015
Singapore's first stand-alone natural history museum finally opened its doors to the public on April 18, 2015 and members of the public warmly welcomed the latest member of our museum and heritage scene. Quintessentially a people's museum, it was supported by a grounds-up fundraising initiative that generated donations from foundations, corporations, and thousands of members of the public.
While the museum is new, the inspiration for its establishment can be traced all the way back to Sir Stamford Raffles himself. Over the years, many have pushed for the idea of a stand-alone natural history museum in Singapore; in 2005, Professor Tommy Koh, Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large and Honorary Chairman of National Heritage Board, formally proposed the idea. However, due to a lack of funding, the project never materialised. It was only in 2009, after a group of anonymous donors came forward with seed funding, that the idea took root.
Over a weekend in May hosting 2009's International Museum day, the collection which was then housed in the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR) at the National University of Singapore, saw over 3,000 visitors â€” more than what RMBR would see in a year! This keen interest, along with awareness raised by articles in The Straits Times surrounding the idea of a museum, followed a string of donations from the public which amounted to almost $1 million, $25 million from the Lee Foundation, along with the original seed funding given by the group of anonymous donors, which allowed the project to progress. It was because of the interest and generosity of the public that LKCNHM stands as it does today.
A secretary gave a month of her salary; a retired technician at the NUS Biological sciences department gave another $20,000. The museum's centrepieces â€” Prince, Apollonia and Twinky, a trio of among the largest creatures to roam the earth about 150 million years ago â€” would not be around had Della Lee, wife of Lee Foundation chairman Lee Seng Gee, not generously donated $25 million to the cause. Another signature piece, a 200-year-old narwhal tusk, was donated by the family of late businessman â€œWhampoaâ€ Hoo Ak Kay, one of Singapore's pioneers of the 1800s. The tusk was given to Whampoa by the Russian government in the 1860s as a gift, as he represented them as consul in Singapore.
Both a museum and a research facility, LKCNHM strives to be a leader in Southeast Asian biodiversity â€” in research, education and outreach. The public gallery consists of over 2,000 specimens categorised across 15 different zones. These include the Cabinets of Curiosity zone, which showcases many iconic specimens from our native soil and Singapore Today, a showcase of our island's geology and important conservation work being done by national agencies. The impressive collection of natural specimens and artefacts tells the story of our island nation.
This precious gem of an institution stands as testament to the role we, as seemingly ordinary citizens, have in shaping and preserving Singapore's heritage story.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/still-standing/story,"Singapore is all gleaming spires and sleek edifices today, but back in the day when these were rarer, she achieved a different type of architectural feat. Post-colonial Singapore had various architectural styles represented in her skyline which were telling of the nation's turbulent past, but most of them have since given way to the towering skyscrapers that came with our economic advancement.
Of the buildings of yesteryear, some have been demolished, others, refurbished â€“ and they continue to stand proud today amongst the steely faÃ§ades of newer glass monoliths. Some of these structures include the Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall, Old Supreme Court, and CHIJMES.
Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall

Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall did not start off as a theatre when it was completed in 1862. Initially built as a Town Hall with an accompanying theatre, it soon became too small to serve its dual function of housing a venue for local dramas and operas, as well as a space for government agencies and the Singapore Library.
Following the passing of Queen Victoria in 1901, a public meeting was held in the Town Hall to pass the resolution of building a memorial hall for the late queen on the land adjacent to the Town Hall building. Designed in Palladian style to reflect the Italian Renaissance, it opened in 1905 and was later accompanied by a newly refurbished Town Hall that now served as a municipal theatre â€“ the Victoria Theatre. In an effort to unify the appearances of both buildings, a clock tower was built between them, and a portico was duplicated on the Town Hall building to mirror that of the New Memorial Hall.
Over the years, the Victoria Memorial Hall has played an important role in Singapore's political landscape. In the midst of World War II, it served as a hospital; at the end of the war, it saw the trials of Japanese war criminals; and in 1954, the newly formed People's Action Party (PAP) used it for their inaugural meeting. Between the years of 1952 to 1979, the building underwent major renovations to restructure its interiors and increase seating capacity. Accompanying its new appearance was also a new name: Victoria Concert Hall. In 2010, the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall closed for major renovations costing $158-million and reopened in 2015, fully operational.

CHIJMES
Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) was a girls' school established at Victoria Street in 1854 by French Catholic nuns. It underwent extensive restoration works and reopened again in 1996 as CHIJMES | c. 1904 â€“ 1910 | Lim Kheng Chye Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore
The origins of CHIJMES hark back to an older era where it started out as the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ), a Catholic school for girls. Established in 1854 by an order of French Catholic nuns, the site was initially only home to the Caldwell House building which was designed by renowned colonial architect, George Coleman. When the property was bought over, the surrounding parcels of land were also acquired with the intention of building a girls' school. The four-acre precinct soon came to include English-language primary and secondary schools, Chinese-medium school St Nicholas Girls, an orphanage, the nuns' quarters and a chapel.
By 1983, the primary and secondary school relocated to new premises in Toa Payoh and the remaining site was redeveloped and partitioned to house the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) headquarters. Of the longstanding complex, the Caldwell House, chapel and orphanage building remain â€“ today, a plaza of nightlife spots and retail shops. Amongst the five Neo-Classical buildings, the chapel â€“ now known as CHIJMES Hall â€“ remains the centrepiece. The Gothic chapel features intricate 19th century stained-glass windows made in Bruges, Belgium that depicts scenes from the Bible. Below arched cross-vaulted ceilings, wooden pews imported from Toulouse, France, sit on colourful terrazzo tiles. The building's exterior, with its flying buttresses, elaborate Corinthian columns, and five storey Gothic-style steeple, is an impressive sight. Also adding to the different aesthetics of the self-contained city block, is the 176-year-old Caldwell House that emphasizes Ionic columns and sweeping courtyards with cobblestone floors and fountains.

Queenstown, also known to some as the queen of estates,1 was initiated by the British in 1952 as Singapore's first satellite town.2
A satellite town is essentially a self-sufficient housing estate located outside the city centre with its own amenities, schools, shops, markets, cinemas, and places of worship.3
This public housing model, with satellite towns better known as the heartlands today, has since been replicated across the island.4
Watch: Queenstown: The First Satellite Town

Singapore's first public housing skyscraper
The ambitious plan to build Queenstown was undertaken by the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT). Naming it after Queen Elizabeth II to mark her coronation,5 the SIT set out to construct five estates â€“ the Princess Estate, Duchess Estate, Tanglin Halt, Commonwealth,6 as well as Queen's Close and Queen's Crescent.7
When the Housing Development Board took over its development in 1960, it added the neighbourhoods of Mei Ling and Buona Vista.8
The former Buller Camp,9 as well as Boh Beh Kang village's swamps, cemeteries and farmland, were among the first areas the SIT built over.10
The SIT's Forfar House, with its pleasant curves and modern sanitation system, was 14 storeys tall and comprised 106 flats. (c1956. Image from the National Archives of Singapore)
Among the new structures heralding a new era of public housing was the 14-storey Forfar House at Queenstown11 â€“ the first ever public housing skyscraper to grace Singapore's skyline.12 Featuring undulating curves across its facade, the structure had been solidly constructed to withstand wind pressure. Its various residential units were also among the first in Singapore to be equipped with modern toilets and built-in rubbish chutes,13 modern conveniences for its occupants who used to live in village huts.14 The 1956 landmark was demolished and replaced in the 2000s,15 by the even taller 40-storey Forfar Heights' residences.16

Crown jewels
Among the other standout structures to rise in Queenstown was Alexandra Road's red-bricked Princess House which was designed to host offices and community facilities.18 Its occupants included the SIT, the HDB which sited its headquarters there in 1960, 19 as well as the departments of Social Welfare and Licensing which were responsible for issuing hawker licenses as Singapore transitioned itinerant and street hawkers to purpose-built markets and food centres.20
Princess House was conserved in 2007 for its historical and social significance. 21

Commonwealth Avenue Wet Market, which opened on 23 October 1960, was has been well-loved by residents. It was one of the first wet markets to rise on the island22 and the last standing market in Singapore to have been designed by the SIT. 23 It was gazetted for conservation in 2013. 24

The town of many 'firsts'
Queenstown's developments over the years reflect the country's pioneering and innovative spirit,25 with the planning area playing host to many â€œfirstsâ€ on the public housing front.

For instance, it was where the first HDB flats in the form of Stirling Road's blocks 45, 48, and 49 rose. Completed in 1961,26 they came in handy for displaced victims of the Bukit Ho Swee fire which occurred the same year.
Later, the first point blocks to have ever been built in Singapore were erected on Mei Ling Street. The units went on sale in April 1970.27
Adding finishing touches to the self-contained town, the HDB introduced amenities for learning, entertainment, health and sports.28 This resulted in the opening of Singapore's first full-time branch library, the Queenstown Public Library;29 the first polyclinic, Queenstown Polyclinic; as well as the first ever neighbourhood sports complex, the Queenstown Sports Complex.30

Similar satellite towns were subsequently launched by the HDB across Singapore. These days, more than 80 per cent of the population live in HDB flats.31 Even so, Queenstown remains one of the most sought-after residential estates in Singapore,32 living up to its name as the queen of towns.

The Singapore flag could have been blue.1 It was one of several proposed designs that had been put forward by founding father Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye (10 December 1921 - 3 February 2012) and his committee.2 Eventually, another design â€“ red and white with five stars and a crescent â€“ was picked. Toh, who was the People's Action Party's (PAP) founding chairman, had been given the task of developing Singapore's official symbols to reflect the values and identity of the newly-formed self-governing state.
Apart from the flag, Dr Toh also contributed to the design of the state crest3 and worked on the national anthem with composer Zubir Said4
A scholar shaped by hardship
Toh, born in Taiping, Perak on 10 December 1921, was academically inclined and managed to secure a scholarship to study at the prestigious Raffles College in Singapore.5
His studies, however, had to be put on hold during the Japanese Occupation (1942-1945). During the war, he eked out a living as a hawker assistant and grew potatoes and tapioca to survive.6 7 This experience gave him first-hand exposure to the hardships and suffering of the people of war-torn Singapore and shaped his political outlook and leanings.8
Toh eventually graduated from Raffles College in 1946 and went on to pursue a doctorate in physiology at the National Institute for Medical Research in London in 1949.9
Foray into political activism
While in London, Toh met Goh Keng Swee,10 who had co-founded an anti-colonial student group. Known as the Malayan Forum, members met regularly to discuss an independent trajectory for Singapore and Malaya.11 Toh, who shared the group's ideals, joined them. Goh, who was due back in Singapore,12 later nominated Toh to take over his role as chairman.13
The founding of the PAP
Upon his return to Singapore, Toh participated in clandestine basement meetings at Lee Kuan Yew's Oxley Road bungalow. Goh too was present. These meetings led to the establishment of the PAP on 21 November 1954,14 an open and legal political party seeking independence for Singapore.15 Toh has been credited for initiating the party's formation.16

Monumental tasks ahead
With a capable and passionate team in his corner, Toh successfully ran for the position of Legislative Assemblyman for the constituency of Rochore in 1959.17 Soon after, he was tasked to head a committee to design the Singapore flag and state crest. There were many things to take into consideration at the time including the sentiments of neighbouring countries as well as Singapore's multiracial population. After careful deliberation, Toh designed the flag and state crest to represent Singapore's aspirations and its geographical significance.18
When Singapore needed its own national anthem, Toh was once again called upon. He was responsible for shortlisting Encik Zubir Said's composition Majulah Singapore which had originally been written to commemorate the newly-renovated Victoria Theatre in 1958. Toh was instrumental in shaping the final cut of the song, suggesting, among other things, to shorten its length and tweak its melody for easy recall. The revised version was unveiled along with the state flag when Singapore gained independence in 1965.19 
Decades of selfless service
Toh served as Singapore's deputy prime minister from 1959 to 1968, minister of science and technology from 1968 to 1975, and minister of health from 1975 to 1981.20 
Apart from his ministerial portfolios, Toh also took on the role of vice-chancellor from 1968 to 1975 at the National University of Singapore (NUS) where he introduced nationally-oriented reforms prioritising engineering and architecture in support of Singapore's industrialisation efforts.21 
Toh also helped to centralise the university's various campuses at Kent Ridge,22  and played an important part in setting up the National University Hospital (NUH).23

After stepping down from the cabinet in 1981, Toh continued serving in his role as member of parliament for Rochore for another seven years.24  An advocate for critical thinking, he became a vocal source of opposition to his own party, debating hot issues such as the Medisave Scheme, Central Provident Fund's age withdrawal limit,25 as well as press freedom.26  
Toh received a number of distinctions and awards for his dedication to the nation. For his 29 years at Rochore's helm, the Toh Chin Chye Benevolent Fund for the elderly was established. Toh was also awarded the Order of Nila Utama (First Class) for his contributions leading up to and after Singapore's independence. Later, in 2001, the NUS launched the Toh Chin Chye Professorship in Molecular Biology.27

The national pledge is recited in schools across Singapore most mornings â€“ a tradition upheld since 1966.1 The 38-word oath, largely written by wordsmith and former journalist Sinnathamby Rajaratnam (25 February 1915 â€“ 22 February 2006),2 encapsulates the core values that form the bedrock of our nation. Apart from famously lending his expertise to the development of the pledge, Rajaratnam, who was one of the founding members of the People's Action Party (PAP), is also known for his dedication to the nation, having held down numerous portfolios during his long political career.3
Journalist turned politician
Born in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, Rajaratnam was just six months old when he was brought to Seremban, Malaya to join his father, a supervisor at a rubber plantation.
An avid reader, he studied at Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur and Raffles Institution in Singapore. Later, he pursued law at King's College in London. This, however, came to an abrupt halt during World War II. To make a living during these difficult times, Rajaratnam became a journalist.
Rajaratnam and his Hungarian wife, Piroska Feher, returned to Malaya in 1947 where he secured a job with the Malaya Tribune the following year. After two years with the publication, Rajaratnam joined the Singapore Standard as an associate editor before moving to The Straits Times where he worked for five years.
During the course of his journalism career, Rajaratnam wrote pieces opposing colonial rule and communist ideologies. These articles attracted the attention of Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee. In 1954, the four of them, together with other founding members, formed the PAP.
Rajaratnam, whose views widely resonated with locals, contested in the 1959 Legislative Assembly general election and won a spot as assemblyman for the constituency of . He was also appointed Minister for Culture.

Putting Singapore on the map
When Singapore gained independence in 1965, Rajaratnam became the nation's first ever minister for foreign affairs. He was effective in this role, forging positive relationships with other nations and successfully articulating Singapore's brand and credo. In 1968, he took on another portfolio â€“ that of Minister of Labour.

Closer to home Rajaratnam was recognised as one of the founding fathers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, having represented Singapore in 1967 at an event designed to establish the regional economic union.
In Singapore, Rajaratnam is celebrated for developing the national pledge shortly after the island's emotionally wrought separation from Malaysia. The oath he drafted espouses timeless values such as racial harmony, unity, equality and progress. On National Day, Singaporeans young and old, standing with their right fists over their hearts, pledge to uphold these principles and standards.
Rajaratnam continued to serve faithfully on homeground. In 1980, he became the second deputy prime minister, a position he held for five years before taking on the responsibility of senior minister in the Prime Minister's Office for three years. He eventually retired in 1988.
Rajaratnam remembered
Rajaratnam never stopped working. He served as a senior distinguished fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asia Studies from 1988 to 1997.4
The numerous world leaders and throngs of Singaporeans who convened at the Esplanade for his state funeral in February 2006, was a reflection of the deep respect he had earned from people far and wide over the course of his career. The same year, Raffles Institution named a new building in his honour. The Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University followed suit, renaming itself the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in 2007.5

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
Tan Tock Seng, Goh Keng Swee and the late Lee Kuan Yew â€” all integral Singaporean icons, and all of them â€œPeranakanâ€. The Malay word â€œPeranakanâ€ commonly refers to the creolized Chinese who lived in Southeast Asia. The community gained a reputation with its close ties to the British under colonial rule, but were also crucial players in Sun Yat Sen's revolutionary activities and of course, our country's rise since independence. In celebration of our country's 50th anniversary, an exhibition showcasing the lives of 50 great Peranakans who contributed significantly to the development of our nation ran at the Peranakan Museum in 2015.
The featured 50 Peranakans in the exhibition
â€˜Great Men'
In our reading of Singapore's history, we must not forget the pivotal role Peranakans have played in shaping it â€” from the obscure kapitans, the baba captains of industry, to members of our first Legislative Council. We must also dispel the myths and misconceptions surrounding the community. The Peranakans were not merely rich, English-educated dilettantes who collaborated with the British and Dutch colonial masters, nor were they part of the large migration of Chinese who came to Singapore to find a better life. Women are outnumbered in the selected group for the exhibition, which to a certain extent reflects the cloistered lives of nyonyas before the twentieth century. But while the lives of Peranakan women are not as well documented, their contributions are apparent in the community's culture, including in the aspects of dress, food, residences, and social behaviour.
Crossing Boundaries
The Peranakans' influence spread beyond the shores of Singapore. While the 50 featured in the exhibition were selected based on their contributions to Singapore, many were born and had made large impacts elsewhere. The community's strong connections to Malacca, Penang, and Java highlight Singapore's comparative newness as an independent entity. From 1819 to 1959, Singapore functioned as a British colony and the centrepiece of the Straits Settlements. Many of the individuals who found their way to the young nation also had connections and family networks throughout the region.
The Peranakans were quick to adapt to changing political circumstances. During the colonial period, they became powerful compradors and collaborators with the British and Dutch regimes. With the rise of Chinese nationalism in the late nineteenth century, some became crucial players in Sun Yat Sen's revolutionary activities both within and outside China. Most leaders saw no contradiction in supporting both the British and the Chinese. World War II marked a turning point, after which some Peranakans began to champion for an independent Singapore and Malaya. The common caricature of Peranakans as â€œKing's Chineseâ€ and their closeness to the British should not obscure their active engagement with Chinese culture and the Chinese community. Although many Peranakans lost their fluency and literacy in Chinese, they nonetheless supported Chinese or bilingual education, and founded Chinese newspapers. Some Peranakans converted to Christianity from around 1900, while others rediscovered Confucianism. Peranakans carefully balanced the two empires of British and Chinese. As they knelt loyally to receive visiting British royals, they also paid homage to Qing dignitaries. As some proudly received British decorations, they also purchased overseas Chinese honours.
Beyond their national contributions, a study of institutional histories and memories related to the selected Peranakans has also revealed individual legacies. These are documented in temples, associations, churches, schools, hospitals, and private families, as well as in libraries, archives, and museums. Many of the objects shown in the exhibition are hybrid in form and design. The exhibition did not attempt to represent or define a Peranakan aesthetic, but, rather, celebrated the variety and inconsistencies within the community. Memoirs, interviews, and private collections paint intimate images of these exemplary figures. The objects featured in this exhibition ranged from spectacular furnishings, personal belongings, and rare portraits, to humble images, handwritten papers, and objects of everyday use.
One notable aspect of Peranakan families today is the extent of their knowledge of their past and their relations, whether by blood, marriage, or friendship. The Peranakan Museum is grateful for their generosity in supporting this exhibition and has been impressed by the strong sense of community and connectivity among Peranakans â€” ties which seem to have strengthened in recent years with the revival of interest in Peranakan culture. The Peranakans remind us that Singapore has long been closely connected with family and trade networks with the region â€” not only Penang and Malacca but also Jakarta and the rest of Java, and elsewhere. Taken as a whole, the biographies and objects on display in the exhibition illuminate not just the history of the Peranakans in Singapore, but that of the wider nation as well.
Tan Tock Seng
The First Community Leader 1798â€“1850
Portrait of Tan Tock Seng, 1950s. Oil on canvas. Collection of Tan Jiew Hoe.
Born in Malacca, Tan Tock Seng moved to Singapore in the year it was founded by the British. He sold produce before building a fortune as a landowner in partnership with J. H. Whitehead of Shaw, Whitehead and Co. Tan was the first Asian to be appointed a Justice of the Peace in Singapore and is remembered principally for founding Singapore's first hospital for poor Chinese.
At the request of the governor of Singapore, William Butterworth, Tan contributed $7,000 to start a public hospital. In 1844, the foundation was laid for the Chinese Paupers' Hospital, which received its first patients in 1849. The hospital was named after Tan Tock Seng after his death in 1850.
Lim Nee Soon
Pineapple King And Chinese Nationalist Supporter 1879â€“1936
Lim Nee Soon, China Studio, early 20th century. Photograph. Collection of Ivy Kwa.
In 1911, Lim Nee Soon started a rubber and pineapple company. His large plantations in the booming pineapple industry soon earned him the nickname of â€œpineapple kingâ€. A close friend of Sun Yat Sen, Lim became deeply involved in Chinese Nationalist politics. In 1904, together with Teo Eng Hock and Tan Chor Nam, he founded the revolutionary newspaper Thoe Lam Jit Poh (å›¾å—æ—¥æŠ¥). Lim also participated in the founding of the Singapore branch of the Tong Meng Hui (åŒç›Ÿä¼š), the Nationalist underground organisation. The organizers met at Teo Eng Hock's house, Wan Qing Yuan (æ™šæ™´å›­), which is today the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall. In 1925, Lim became an honorary advisor to the president of China. He was given a state funeral in Nanjing and buried near Sun Yat Sen's mausoleum.
Goh Soon Tioe
Maestro and Impresario 1911â€“1982
Goh Soon Tioe, 1940s. Photograph. Collection of Vivien Goh.
Goh Soon Tioe was a pioneer in the development of classical music in Singapore. Born in Padang, Sumatra, he came to Singapore at the age of 13 to study at the Anglo-Chinese School. Goh only started violin lessons at the age of 15 but showed great promise, and in 1932 he left for Switzerland to join the Conservatoire de Musique de GenÃ¨ve, where he studied for three years. During his time there, he was awarded the â€œPremier Prixâ€ â€” first prize â€” in each annual exam.
In 1954, Goh founded the Goh Soon Tioe String Orchestra. In the 1950s and 1960s, he ventured into concert promotion by bringing internationally renowned musicians to perform in Singapore. However, he was not able to continue organising these concerts because, as he observed, â€œcosts are heavy and work is hardâ€. In his studio above a garage in Oldham Lane and later in his home in Balmoral Crescent, he taught many of Singapore's musical prodigies, including violinists Lynnette Seah and Lee Pan Hon, pianists Seow Yit Kin and Melvyn Tan, and conductor Choo Hoey. Goh was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1963 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the music scene in Singapore.
Lee Choo Neo
Singapore's First Female Doctor 1895â€“1947
Wedding photograph of Teo Koon Lim and Lee Choo Neo, 1922. Photograph. Collection of Vera Teo.
Lee Choo Neo was Singapore's first female physician. Breaking away from the tradition of the cloistered nyonya, she used her privileged position to help enact social reforms. Lee was the daughter of Lee Hoon Leong, a Peranakan from Semarang who was manager of Oei Tiong Ham's shipping business in Singapore. Educated at the Singapore Chinese Girls' School, she was the first Straits Chinese woman to obtain a Senior Cambridge certificate in 1911. She studied at the King Edward VII School of Medicine in Singapore, and became the city's first Chinese female doctor in 1920. These were remarkable achievements considering the general Chinese cultural expectations of women's roles.

Be Muse Volume 8 Issue 1 â€“ Apr to June 2015
In recent years, the display of human remains has become a topic of discussion in Western countries, particularly those with a history of colonialism. The Codes of Ethics provided by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and the Museum Association UK offer guidelines on how to handle such collections and address questions of aims, but they are primarily intended for Western societies that deal with opposition from â€œpeople of originâ€ â€“ the descendants of the people whose remains are displayed. The guidelines do not specifically address human remains at museums in regions from which they originated.
As a former British colony in Southeast Asia, Singapore assimilates its familiarity with Asian cultures with concepts of museum governance based on western principles. Hence, it is in a good position to reconsider how such artefacts may be treated with sensitivity.
A Modern Framework For Handling Ancient Human Remains
Human remains in museums have historically been â€œimplicated in situations of inequalityâ€. In the United States, laws for the repatriation of human remains, such as the Native American Graves Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990, accorded indigenous communities â€œequal rights regarding their deadâ€. This paved the way for overseas communities to request for their ancestors' remains from museums worldwide.
In the United Kingdom, laws allowing museum collections to be held for perpetuity were relaxed after unrelenting campaigning from such groups. Since 1995, the British Museum has received six requests from organisations - including the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and the Museum of New Zealand - making claims on its collections of human remains.
The British Department for Culture, Media and Sports eventually produced guidelines for the care and return of human remains in 2005. Similar provisions were also drafted for the Museum Association UK and the American Alliance of Museums, iterating the need for a formal framework to manage human remains on display in a sensitive and culturally appropriate manner.
The late ICOM Code of Professional Ethics, revised and adopted in 2004, stated that the display of human remains must â€œtake into account the interests and beliefs of members of the community, ethnic or religious groups from whom the objects originated.â€ The code also highlighted the possibility of â€œoriginating communitiesâ€ requesting for the removal and return of such remains from public display, and how museums could address these requests â€œexpeditiously with respect and sensitivityâ€. As the secretariat of ICOM Singapore, the National Heritage Board (NHB) and its member museums in Singapore must adhere to the ICOM Code of Professional Ethics.
In particular, the way human remains are handled in three of the NHB's member museums in Singapore is note-worthy. The collections in the Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM), the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, and the Department of Anatomy Museum in the National University of Singapore (NUS) are ethnographical, religious and medical in nature respectively. This allows us to see how different curatorial directions affect the treatment of human remains, and if such approaches may signal a way for other museums worldwide to follow.
A Level-headed Approach to a Headhunting Tradition
The ACM is an ethnographic museum that focuses on pan-Asian cultures and civilisations, including those originating from China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia. The Dayak Carved Human Skull is the centrepiece of a permanent display showcasing the lifestyle of the indigenous Dayak tribe of Borneo. It is physical proof that the Dayaks engaged in headhunting activities, even though the practice has long been outlawed by Malaysian and Indonesian governments in Borneo.
ACM went to great lengths to assure visitors that headhunting was not a form of brutal tribal behaviour. The catalogue gave a balanced view by explaining how the Dayak tradition of headhunting was an honourable means to â€œimprove the community's well-beingâ€ as human heads were â€œbelieved to contain a powerful beneficial spiritual essenceâ€. In fact human heads were treated respectfully by the Dayaks. Major rituals followed each successful headhunting expedition. Captured heads were honoured and proudly displayed in the ancestral longhouse. Elaborate swirl patterns on the skulls show that these were not merely war trophies, but revered artefacts.
ACM thus framed its curation of the Dayak human skull within an anthropological understanding of the Dayak tribe. The Dayaks are portrayed as an important component of Nusantara (Malay world). The museum also noted similarities in social structures found in some communities in Riau-Lingga sultanates, where Singapore's Malay community draws its ancestry.
Other museums such as Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and the Pennsylvanian Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum), which also included Dayak carved skulls in its collections, treated these artefacts with similar sensitivity. In a special volume of Penn Museum's Expedition magazine, the tribe's practice of headhunting was described in the social context of â€œcontributing to the prosperity of community through performance of certain important rituals, such as the Iban Dayak kenyalang, which required fresh human heads for their performanceâ€.
Curating The Religious Remains Of Buddha
The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum serves two functions. Firstly, it honours the tooth relic and other Buddhist relics, or sarira, purportedly from Gautama Buddha. Secondly, the temple exhibits these relics and other religious artefacts in a museum setting to impart Dharma and promote awareness of the faith.
The relics from Buddha's remains are venerated and enshrined in elaborate reliquaries housed in the museum's Relics Chamber. In Buddhism, the crystal-like sarira is the embodiment of spiritual energy culminated by Buddha and eminent monks during their lifetimes, and represent a person's â€œsanghaâ€ or Buddhism learning. Buddhists believe that before Buddha's departure, he had said: â€œ...if thou all see my relics, it would be as good as meeting in person, as good as learning the Dharma and as good as knowing nirvana.â€ Hence, relics associated with Buddha's remains are highly regarded by the religion's devotees.
The centrepiece of the museum, the Buddha Tooth relic, is housed in a 3.6m-high stupa made with 270kg of gold that was donated by devotees. Buddhists believe that â€œrelics can grow and multiplyâ€, which may be seen as not only a testament of faith, but also a departure from conventional Asian attitudes in that devotees do not view exhibiting these remains as culturally taboo. Similar beliefs are seen elsewhere: Sri Lankan Buddhists view relics enshrined in the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy as a means of receiving Buddha's blessings and to â€œprocure wishes for economic wealth and health.â€ The translocation of the Buddha Tooth from Sri Lanka to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Singapore is also an example of how Buddhism may be spread via the veneration of these relics.
The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and its curation of Buddha's remains are driven by the veneration for the Buddha Tooth and sarira. Its curatorial approach also focuses on how the display of such relics represent the religion's beliefs and their spread across Asia.
Respecting a School's â€œSilent Mentorsâ€
At the Anatomy Museum (AM) in NUS, embalmed cadavers hold specific parts of the human body, which are arranged anatomically. The curatorial approach of AM may be described as that of a teaching museum founded on the educational needs of medical students and instructors.
The cadavers on display came from donors who had pledged their bodies for medical use after their deaths. That said, the bodies are only dissected and embalmed after a â€œclaimsâ€ period of three years. As some facial features are still discernible, AM does not allow its handlers or viewers to take any pictures as a mark of respect. Students are also prohibited from making â€œHumourous and derogatory remarksâ€ towards the cadavers. Visits to the museum must be booked ahead, and access is usually granted only to medical students and practitioners. Similar guidelines are practised in other pathology museums, including the Wellcome Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons, and The Gordon Museum in King's College in the UK.
Unlike the controversial Body Worlds exhibition that showed plastinated cadavers in positions mimicking horse riding, fencing and swimming, the cadavers on display in AM are treated respectfully. Cadavers come with detailed write-ups of the donors' medical histories which highlight the museum's emphasis on education. The museum also runs a â€œSilent Mentorâ€ programme that provides information for body donation, and holds an annual ceremony to show its appreciation towards â€œonce living individuals whose bodies are used to impart invaluable anatomical knowledgeâ€. These practices demonstrate a unique way for treating human remains with dignity.
Paving The Way Forward
Academics argue that exhibiting human remains perpetuates a â€œconstruction of otherness within an anthropological discourse that tends to privilege the visual and the spatialâ€. In other words, the once-living person is now viewed with a sense of detachment in the museum â€“ not unlike an exotic artefact. Curation practices in these three Singapore museums thus demonstrate the importance of placing human remains within a larger context. From portraying headhunting as a unique ritual practised by Dayaks, to the veneration of Buddha's relics as religious devotion, and the role of silent mentors, donated cadavers, play to students of the human body, all three museums have own a way to fulfill their respective curatorial objectives, while still according the remains with the deepest respect possible.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 1 â€“ Apr to Jun 2015
Maps are fascinating objects. Visual and textual, they tell us about the world they depict and provide a glimpse into the worldview of their makers. In Singapore, maps are especially significant as they are the earliest material evidence of our past.
As part of Geo|Graphic: Celebrating Maps and their Stories, exhibitions and programmes were organized by the National Library that explored maps and mapping in both historical and contemporary contexts. They ran until 19 July 2015.
The two historical exhibitions â€” Land of Gold and Spices: Early Maps of Southeast Asia and Singapore, and Island of Stories: Singapore Maps â€” showcase the collections of the National Library and the National Archives of Singapore respectively. They provide amazing insight into the history and transformation of Singapore's landscape, and how Southeast Asia was imagined and mapped by the Europeans.
Geo|Graphic's contemporary art components, Mind the Gap: Mapping the Other, and SEA STATE 8 seabook: An Art Project by Charles Lim (co-organised with the NUS Museum), invited visitors to reflect on the concepts of mapping and what maps might look like in the hands of an artist.
Here are some highlights from the exhibitions Land of Gold and Spices and Island of Stories.
Map featuring a naval battle by Theodore de Bry, Frankfurt, 1607. | Collection of National Library, Singapore
Printed in 1607, this is a schematic map of a brutal Luso-Dutch naval confrontation that took place between 6 and 11 October 1603, in the Johor River (Rio Batusabar) and close to Pedra Branca (Pedro Blanca). The Johor Fleet (allies of the Dutch) is shown waiting at a shoal off the eastern coast of Singapore. The map, produced by Flemish goldsmith, engraver and publisher Theodore de Bry (1528â€“98), has been drawn with the east orientated to the top.
One of the earliest representations of Singapore's coastline, the map is also significant for depicting the battle that illustrates the strategic importance of the Singapore Strait as a waterway connecting the Indian ocean to the South China Sea.
Strait of Singapore, circa 1675-1700 | Collection of Leiden University Library
This hand-drawn chart that shows the Straat Sincapura (Strait of Singapore) is a V.O.C. (Dutch East India Company)-based chart and might have been derived from an earlier version. The outline of the Long Island (â€˜t Lang Eylant) referring to Singapore is not completed at the northern part, perhaps reflecting the cartographer's lack of knowledge of the area. To the south of the strait, a large landmass can be seen. It has a phrase stating that to the southern side of the Singapore Strait are broken islands, or gebrooken eilanden. The cartographer has not drawn the outline of the numerous islands, as little is known about them. This chart with soundings and compass-rose lines, however, identifies two navigational landmarks in the Singapore Strait: Johor Hill and the twin peaks of Bintan, both of which are highlighted in black ink.
Detail of a map of Singapore and the Melaka Strait by Jacques Nicolas Bellin, Paris, 1755 | Collection of National Library, Singapore
Jacques Nicolas Bellin (1703â€“72) was a French hydrographer who created maps for several key publications in the 18th century. On this map, Bellin depicts the island of Singapore and calls it Pulo or Isle Panjang (Pulau Panjang, meaning Long Island in Malay, or Panjang Island). If the main island of Singapore is named at all on early European maps, it is most often called Pulau Panjang. On this map, the old Strait of Singapore (Vieux Detroit de Sincapour) is shown as the waterway between Singapore and Johor, which is known today as the Johor or Tebrau Strait (Selat Tebrau in Malay).
Interestingly, Bellin shows two islands on the Johor Strait: Salat Buro and Joor. It seems that Salat Buro, or Selat Tebrau, has been mistakenly depicted as an island; similarly, Joor is presumed to be Johor Lama. The two islands depicted are likely to be present-day Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. The lack of knowledge on most European maps about the Johor Strait suggests that European navigators did not use this maritime route much.
Singapore Harbour: Proposed improvements, 1904 | Singapore Harbour Board collection | Courtesy of National Archives of Singapore
By the early 20th century, Singapore, dubbed the â€œGateway to the Eastâ€, had become a major international port serving the thriving trade between Asia and Europe. The sheer volume of ships and cargo that Singapore handled strained its port's infrastructure, which had become inadequate to meet its growing requirements by the late 19th century. This necessitated major harbour improvements, and this map of the Singapore harbour shows the proposed harbour improvement works drawn up in 1904 by the British government's consulting engineer Coode, Son & Matthews. It contains hydrographic details, including the soundings of the harbour, and the direction and velocity of the harbour's tides.
Some of the proposed improvements included plans to reclaim land to extend and straighten the wharf at Telok Ayer to make it easier and safer for ships to dock; to deepen the harbour; and to construct a series of moles, or breakwaters. But due to budget and technical difficulties, and public outcry against the move, only the southern inner mole was built. The one-mile-long (about 1.6 km) detached breakwater would remain a major landmark in Singapore until the late 1970s, when the waters around and behind the breakwater were reclaimed to create Marina Bay.
Map of Syonan City, 1943 | Port of Singapore Authority | Collection of National Archives of Singapore
The Imperial Japanese Army reprinted copies of the British Survey Department maps, and this particular reprint of the Singapore Gazetteer Map shows the main roads in the town area of Singapore renamed in Japanese script.
While most of the road names remained unchanged and were simply spelt out phonetically in the Japanese katakana script, public buildings, such as government buildings, hospitals and even cinemas, were given new Japanese names. For instance, Capitol Cinema, Cathay Cinema and Raffles Hotel were renamed Kyo-Ei Gekijo (å…±æ¦®), Dai To'a Gekijo (å¤§æ±äºœåŠ‡å ´) and Shonan Ryokan (æ˜­å—æ—…é¤¨), respectively. The selective renaming of such public landmarks allowed the Japanese administration to assert sovereignty over Syonan-to â€” Singapore's name during the Occupation â€” without causing widespread confusion.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/belly-of-the-carp/belly-of-the-carp,"Back in the days when a journey to far off lands usually meant a long sea voyage, ports were the hubs of exchange â€“ a merchant's gateway to international trade, a captain's safe harbour to refuel and a land of opportunity for anyone willing to work hard.
When it was called Temasek, Singapore was one of many port cities situated along the Straits of Malacca; the gateway in and out of Southeast Asia. It had a deep sea harbour and was strategically located between India and China, making it a promising entrepot.

Singapore's growth as a port
Leveraging the island's reputation as an ancient port of importance with traders in the region, the groundwork laid by Major-General William Farquhar and aspirations of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 caused Singapore to become one of the premier places for international trade, business and success.
In contrast to the Dutch â€“ another maritime power that controlled trade in the Malay Archipelago â€“ the decision by Raffles to make Singapore a free port attracted merchants from the region and beyond. In just two years, almost 3,000 vessels with 200,000 tonnes of cargo visited the port, and in four years, the population had grown to more than 10,000.
Scene of the crowded Singapore River and Fort Canning (c. Late 19th-early 20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
Along the winding river, Boat Quay would be the first stretch to experience the transformation. This particular part of the river became known as the â€œBelly of the Carpâ€ because of its curved shape which resembled the fish, deemed an auspicious symbol by the Chinese. It was at this location that many godowns and warehouses were built. It quickly became crowded with cargo-packed bumboats. The sight of junks and cargo boats with flapping sails became a common sight on the river.
Singapore soon became one of the most popular ports to trade at. Besides serving as the centre of trade in Southeast Asia, the island overtook Batavia as the main hub for Chinese junk trade. This was only the beginning, and Singapore eventually supplanted the Riau Islands as the export gateway for the gambier and pepper industry of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago, as well as South Johor. Even the Teochew trade in marine produce and rice came to our shores.
Constructing roads and architecture
A significant milestone in the evolution of the port was the construction of roads and railways to support the bustling sea trade. Primary materials such as crude oil, rubber and tin from the Malay Peninsula were transported to Singapore for further processing into staple products, before being shipped off to Britain and other international markets.
Besides the merchants and businessmen, the types of visitors started to grow to include a mix of travellers and seamen. â€œLa Favouriteâ€, a French corvette on a voyage to sail around the world, also found respite in Singapore's safe harbour for five days en route to far-off New Zealand.
This print (aquatint) shows the French corvette â€˜La Favorite', under the command of Captain Cyrille Laplace, which sailed eastwards around the world between 1830 and 1833. (c. 1856. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
Raffles directed land on the north bank to be reserved for government buildings; the east of this plot was allocated to the Europeans, and further east for the Arabs and Bugis. However, the needs of commerce thwarted this plan to some extent, as both European and Asian merchants preferred to locate their businesses by the riverside. Flat and spacious river banks were soon lined with trade houses. These diversified the landscape and were soon followed by the brick warehouses, also known as godowns, ready to receive and store goods arriving on Singapore's shores.
Ocean-faring vessels were too large to navigate the shallow waters of Singapore River. Instead, smaller flat-bottomed craft called lighters or bumboats would ferry cargo between these ships and the docks at the river.
The first stretch of the Singapore River to be developed, Boat Quay originated with Singapore's first land reclamation project to build an embankment. This part of the river, popularly known as the â€œBelly of the carpâ€, brimmed with traditional cargo boats until the Singapore River clean-up was completed in the 1980s.
Commercial hubs such as Raffles Place, Market Street and Fullerton Square also emerged in the river's vicinity as merchants and bankers gathered to exchange news and seize business opportunities, forming one of the key economic pillars of independent Singapore.
The Singapore River Settlement was captured by artist Percy Carpenter in the â€œView of Singapore from Mount Wallichâ€ (which has now since been levelled for the land reclamation of Telok Ayer) in the 1850s. One can identify other landmarks in the painting such as the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Cathedral of the Good Shepherd and St Andrew's Church.
But architecture and buildings were not the only things brightening up river life. The river was also filled with people of diverse communities who came from various parts of the world; some for work, and some for rest and recreation.
People along the River
Armies of coolies, lightermen and stevedores (dockworkers) toiled to unload bales of merchandise into riverside shops and warehouses, while new arrivals came ashore to seek their kinsmen and business associates, or look for work. After a long, hard day work, many who worked by the river would unwind on bridges such as Read Bridge and Coleman Bridge to enjoy a drink and listen to traditional storytellers.
These storytellers would entertain the river communities with tall tales and live music. At a time when literacy was low, newspaper readers would also draw crowds, serving an important function by keeping everyone abreast of the latest happenings.
This mingling of people from all corners of the globe led to cultures and traditions intersecting and interacting on a daily basis on our shores. The port built upon the banks of the Singapore River facilitated not just an exchange of goods, but also of cultures and dreams of building a future.
The Singapore River no longer functions as a harbour for trade, but it continues to flow past important landmarks, buildings and neighbourhoods that serve as a reminder of how modern Singapore began; with the establishment of a trading settlement and through the diverse communities who built and shaped it into the international hub it is today.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2014
For many Peranakan Chinese of Southeast Asia, religion and ritual play a central role in their daily lives. Many ceremonies, from Chinese New Year to the annual tomb cleaning (cheng beng) festival, involve setting up altars and invoking deities and ancestors. Altars usually hold religious paraphernalia and offerings. On special occasions, textiles are draped in front.
Altar cloths, called tok wi in Hokkien (zhuowei in Mandarin), are usually made of silk with embroidered designs and were originally imported from Southern China. Common motifs included dragons, phoenix, qilin, ruyi sceptre, swastika, and other auspicious symbols. The cloths are almost uniformly rectangular â€“ to cover the shape of the front of a typical altar. An extra piece of fabric, also decorated, hangs as a flap over the upper section. Fragments of such hangings and altar frontals have been discovered in excavations of Tang-dynasty (618â€“907) monasteries near the Dunhuang Caves, in present day Gansu province, demonstrating that the tradition has been long-held.

Gift of Matthew and Alice Yapp
By the early twentieth century, Peranakans on Java began using altar cloths made of local batik. These batik altar cloths maintained the form of the embroidered versions, though they adapted established Chinese symbols in imaginative renderings and introduced motifs and designs from Southeast Asian and European cultures. Most batik altar cloths are designed on a single piece of cotton cloth, with depicted, rather than actual, upper panels. It is unclear why Peranakans of Java began using batik altar cloths, but perhaps it was due in part to the already thriving batik industry on the island. Another theory could be that the tropical climate of the East Indies was more suited to textiles made of cotton than of silk. Batik altar cloths show the distinct cross-cultural identity of the Peranakan communities of the region. They are fascinating examples of a community's adaptation to its new surroundings.

THE EXHIBITION
The Peranakan Museum received a donation of seventy-two batik altar cloths from Matthew and Alice Yapp in 2012. The cloths were collected by their son Alvin over a period of ten years. On 11 April 2014, the museum opened the exhibition Auspicious Designs: Batik for Peranakan Altars, which featured several highlights from the collection. The exhibition was divided into five sections over two floors of the museum's special exhibition gallery.
The first section was a contextual display featuring a deity altar and a set of furnishings that might be found in a typical Peranakan home. An altar cloth was draped over the front of the altar table, embroidered hangings adorn the doorways, and chairs flanking the altar were also covered in embroideries. This display emphasised the importance of textiles in demarcating sacred space during special occasions.
Traditional altar setup
The second section focused on the embroidered silk altar cloths made in China. These cloths were imported into Southeast Asia and used by Peranakans. An example on display was a full gold thread altar cloth depicting the Three Star Gods that once belonged to the Chee family, one of the oldest families from Malacca. This section showed examples of cloths that were forerunners to the batik versions produced later in Java.

The third and fourth sections of the exhibition examined the stylistic diversity found in the designs on batik altar cloths. Batik cloths in these two sections are decorated with designs that mix Chinese, Southeast Asian, and European influences.
One of the cloths prominently displayed the coat of arms of the Dutch East Indies at the centre, with Chinese cloud collar motifs at the sides. A selection of Chinese objects, from what are known as the Hundred Antiques, decorated the upper panel. This cloth is possibly one of the oldest batik altar cloths in the museum's collection: it was made using natural dyes.

Another cloth showed the influence of designs popular on batik sarongs. The blue and white cloth with the oral bouquet motif (called buketan in batik terminology) â€“ a sarong design that was made popular by Dutch-Eurasian batik maker Eliza Van Zuylen â€“ is an example of this. Another altar cloth in this section worth highlighting was the only cloth in the collection that is decorated with Roman letters â€“ Chinese characters are much more common. The letters appear to spell the surnames â€œHoeâ€ (or â€œKoeâ€) and â€œSioeâ€, if read from the centre along the border. The middle line reads â€œhongâ€ and â€œlengâ€. In Hokkien, hong is phoenix and leng means dragon; both are depicted on this cloth. The creatures are often used as symbols of a bridal couple, which suggests this cloth may have been used in a wedding.

Altar cloths could also be a means of declaring political affiliation: a cloth from Yogyakarta shows human figures waving the flag of Nationalist China.

Another aspect of batik altar cloths highlighted in the exhibition was the varied interpretations of common Chinese symbols. Batik cloths featuring dragons and qilins, for example, are used to show the physical differences between the two creatures. Other objects featuring these two creatures from the collections of the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Peranakan Museum were displayed alongside these cloths, so that viewers could discuss similarities, and their possible sources.
One interesting comparison worth mentioning was a Balinese palanquin with nagas â€“ a group of serpent deities â€“ depicted on its sides, juxtaposed with a batik altar cloth that shows elongated dragons that more closely resemble the naga than the typical coiled or front-facing Chinese dragons found on embroidered altar cloths.
The fifth and last section provided visitors with the opportunity to learn more about the rituals per- formed by Peranakans, and how different altar cloths were used for different occasions. Cloths used during Chinese New Year and other celebratory events, for example, were coloured in strong auspicious reds and generally bright hues. For funerals, altar cloths with more sombre tones were selected.
These were colours often associated with mourning in the Peranakan world â€“ blues, purples, and greens. An example of this on display was a dark blue cloth from Singapore, which features crane and deer motifs â€“ symbolic of longevity â€“ as well as the cicada, a symbol of immortality.
As with the diverse designs found on them, batik altar cloths are distinctive examples of the cross- cultural interaction inherent in the hybrid identities of the Peranakans. Although these cloths â€“ whether embroidered or batik â€“ have long been a feature of Chinese altars, research into their past remains limited. This exhibition therefore aimed to be a preliminary investigation of these culturally and historically rich textiles, and their multiple influences.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2010
Cheong Soo Pieng (1917-1983) is generally regarded today as one of the most innovative and influential Singapore artists of the 20th century. Essays on him usually focus on his experimental spirit and formalistic innovations, often highlighting his synthesis of Western and Chinese art traditions. For an artist whose practice was so rich and diverse, there remain many fertile areas for future research, of which art patronage is one.
Artists do not live in a vacuum. In early 20th century Singapore, many China-born and trained artists such as Cheong had to initially make a living by teaching art full-time, either in an academy like the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) or local schools. This meant that they had little time for their own practice. Amongst the early NAFA lecturers in the 1940s and 1950s, only a few such as Cheong and Chen Wen Hsi (1906-1991) eventually had the good fortune of early retirement to become full-time artists. Nevertheless, they had to continue to give private art tuition, work on commissions or even start businesses (as in the case of Chen who owned two art galleries) to ensure an alternative income source. What gave them the confidence to give up their full-time jobs to pursue art must, in part, have been the support they received in Singapore and abroad from patrons whom they could count on to either buy their works or recommend them to other collectors.
In Cheong's case, he started teaching at NAFA in 1947, one year after settling down in Singapore. He eventually left his job in 1961. Between 1946 and 1961, he held three successful solo shows in Singapore (1956), Kuala Lumpur and Penang (1957). He later travelled to Europe for two years and held exhibitions in London (Frost and Reed Gallery, 1962; Redfern Gallery, 1963), Munich (Galerie SchÃ¶ninger, 1962) and Oxford (Bear Lane Gallery, 1963). In 1962, he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by the Government of the State of Singapore. He was later honoured in 1967 with a retrospective exhibition at the National Art Gallery in Kuala Lumpur (his 12th solo show) in celebration of his 50th birthday and 25 years as an art teacher.
The support he received from patrons between the late 1940s and the early 1960s likely gave him the confidence and means to become a full-time artist who could travel around the world. This essay is a preliminary examination of Cheong's practice in relation to the burgeoning art market during this period and especially his ties with a key patron from that era â€“ Dato Loke Wan Tho. In particular, it will analyse some of Cheong's works that were collected and later donated by Loke and his estate to the then National Museum of Singapore (now part of the National Heritage Board collection). Hopefully, future research will throw greater light on the critical roles played by various patrons in the development of Cheong's practice and the reception of his works in Singapore and abroad.

Art Scene in Singapore
After the devastation caused by World War II in Singapore, the local art scene slowly regained its footing. In 1946, teaching resumed at NAFA where Cheong became a teacher a year later. During that period, art groups like the Society of Chinese Artists re-established themselves, whilst new ones like the Singapore Art Society (SAS) and Society of Malay Artists (Persekutuan Pelukis Melayu) were set up in 1949. Such societies provided much-needed platforms for artistic exchange and joint exhibitions.
With the erosion of ties with China especially after the start of communist rule in 1949, the idea of a regional Malayan or Nanyang1 identity began to take root amongst the Chinese in Singapore. They started to identify themselves with the region, rather than the place of their birth. This was especially evident in literature and later, the visual arts. Interestingly, the need for a Malayan identity was also echoed by the British colonial government then. The Malayan Emergency took place from 1948 to 1960, during which the British government imposed severe measures to counter the communist insurgency in Malaya. The British also embarked on a cultural strategy to win the hearts and minds of the Malayan public against acts of terror by the Malayan Communist Party. In order to achieve this, the British hoped to create a shared Malayan culture to unite the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo to stand against the Communist threat. Hence, the authorities worked closely with organisations like the SAS. For instance, in the 1950s, the British Council Hall was made available to many cultural and welfare groups, and the SAS even had its administrative office in the council premises.
In the 1950s, the concept of regionalism also dovetailed with growing nationalist sentiments and calls for decolonisation in the region as Singapore moved towards independence in 1965. This need for a Malayan identity continued even after Singapore gained self-government in 1959. One of the first ministries the new local government set up was the Ministry of Culture which was â€œvested with responsibility of formulating policies needed to create a common Malayan cultureâ€.2
Art Market In Singapore
The abovementioned circumstances brought forth a flurry of exhibitions in Singapore, especially those organised by groups such as SAS. An editorial entitled â€œSingapore Wakes Upâ€ in the 1955 SAS magazine reported, â€œIt is probable that visual arts have received more attention and publicity in Singapore in the first eight weeks of 1955 than in any corresponding period in local history. There have been seven exhibitions, seven broadcasts, six public lectures, an unprecedented number of meetings of the various committees of Singapore Art Society, and The Singapore Artist has been widely bought and read.â€3
In the 1940s and 1950s, there were no private art galleries in Singapore. Although venues like the Straits Commercial Art Company shop provided some space for artists like Cheong to display paintings, their primary business was not the sale of artworks. So, in those early years, exhibitions such as those organised by SAS provided critical opportunities for artists to show and sell their works to the public. For instance, the first exhibition held by SAS in 1950 featuring 278 works by 76 local artists, attracted over 6500 visitors and garnered sales of $3363.4
The buyers of such works then were mostly European expatriates and affluent locals. Amongst the more prominent in the former group were art promoter Frank Sullivan5 and art historian Michael Sullivan.6 In the latter group, the most famous was Dato Loke Wan Tho. Although there were other well-known collectors in Malaya then, like Tan Tsze Chor and Wong Man Sze, they tended to collect only Chinese art and antiquities, and had few or no works by contemporary Malayan artists like Cheong. The one exception was Loh Cheng Chuan from Penang who was not only a well-known collector of Chinese art but also a keen patron of local artists.
A Key Patron of The Era: Loke Wan Tho (1915 - 1964)
To many, the late Dato Loke Wan Tho is best known for leading the Cathay Organisation to become an important producer and distributor of Malay and Chinese films in the 1940s and 1950s. His regional business empire included cinemas, film studios and hotels. He was a much sought-after public figure and chairman of major institutions such as the Malayan Airways Ltd and Singapore Telephone Board. Often seen in the company of high government officials and glamorous film stars, he was very much one of the leading members of the Malayan establishment then.

Loke was a man of diverse interests and talents. A keen sportsman, he had a great love for nature. He was an accomplished ornithologist and photographer, and combined both interests to become an award-winning photographer of birds. Loke was also known as a great philanthropist. In particular, he was a tireless supporter of the arts and gave generously of his time and collections to various museums. Through his gifts, Loke supported the founding of the University Art Museum at the University of Malaya in the 1950s.7 As a collector, his interests were eclectic, ranging from Chinese ceramics8 to local modern art. In the latter, he was ably assisted by his personal secretary of 24 years, Ms Ann Talbot-Smith (1905-1983), who was herself also greatly interested in local artists.9
A sampling of Loke's activities as an art patron in the 1950s and 1960s reveals that he was supportive of a wide range of local artists. He was the guest of honour for the opening of exhibitions by established artists such as Chen Wen Hsi10 as well as younger ones like Lu Chon Min.11 For the latter group, these shows mattered a great deal as the artists often relied on the sales proceeds of such exhibitions to fund their overseas studies.12
By the early 1950s, Loke was already active with the SAS, having organised its first photographic exhibition with his good friend and SAS president Dr Carl Gibson-Hill in 1950. And Loke continued to maintain close ties with the SAS through the 1950s and early 1960s. For instance, besides serving as patron of the society in 1960,13 he also opened many of its shows as guest of honour and bought many works at such events. Loke's secretary Talbot-Smith was also closely associated with the SAS, having served as its secretary for a time.14
By the late 1950s, Loke was regarded as having Singapore's largest collection of works by local artists, numbering some 80 works. This was later augmented in 1957 by his purchase of another 64 works from Frank Sullivan who was then SAS vice-president.15 Loke had planned to display them with his own collection in Singapore's first community art gallery.16 This eventually culminated in Loke's decision to donate 99 paintings to the Ministry of Culture in 1960. The list of donated works by 50 artists included well-known names like Cheong as well as younger ones like Thomas Yeo.17 In 1962, Loke added 15 more paintings to the earlier 99 he gave.18 And after Loke's untimely demise in 1964, his estate made another gift of his collection to the state.
Artist And Patron
When Cheong arrived from China in 1946, Loke was already based in Singapore, reviving his family's cinema business after the war. At that time, Cheong was busy teaching at NAFA and had not yet had his first solo show in 1956. Although it is not clear when Loke first met Cheong, the latter was already taking part in group exhibitions then.19 Hence, it is likely that, given his interest in art, Loke would have encountered Cheong's works at annual group exhibitions such as the one organised by the prominent Society of Chinese Artists in 1948 which featured an oil painting by Cheong of a female bather rendered in a cubist-like manner.20 In 1951, Cheong teamed up with Chen Wen Hsi, Chen Chong Swee and Liu Kang, to present a group show called Four Artists from China organised by SAS.21 The same four artists held another group exhibition in 1953 under the auspices of SAS, after their 1952 trip to Bali. Again, it is highly probable that Loke, given his ties with SAS, would have heard of, if not seen Cheong's works at both shows.
Amongst the works by Cheong donated by Loke, the earliest painting is Indian Men with Two Cows (1949). This was listed as â€˜Kampong Scene' and already in Loke's collection when it was exhibited by the SAS in an exhibition titled Ten Years of Art in Singapore in 1956. However, it still does not provide the date of Loke's first purchase of Cheong's works as the painting could have been bought at any time between 1949 and 1956.

However, there is an ink portrait by Cheong of Loke's second wife â€“ the beautiful and glamorous Christina Lee â€“ completed in 1953. This indicates that at least, by the early 1950s, Cheong was familiar enough with Loke to have completed a portrait of the latter's wife.

Apart from Cheong, Christina Lee was known to have posed for a number of famous artists including Xu Beihong, Basoeki Abdullah, Lee Man Fong and Sun Yee.22

Three years later in 1956, Loke was the guest of honour at the opening of Cheong's first solo show in Singapore. Organised by SAS at the British Council Gallery, the show featured a wide range of media, including oils, watercolours, batik, gouache, Chinese ink and sketches. It is helpful here to highlight the close connection between Loke and Frank Sullivan, as the latter was the SAS exhibition organiser for the said show. And again in 1963, Loke opened Cheong's exhibition at the Victoria Memorial Hall in Singapore, showing mostly works completed after the artist's trip to Europe in the preceding two years. The fact that Cheong invited Loke to be the guest of honour at his first solo show in Singapore and that Loke, a highly-regarded personality, twice agreed to officiate at Cheong's shows, testify to the growing relationship between the two men.

It is highly probable that Loke would have shown his encouragement by purchasing Cheong's works at such openings. By the 1950s, Loke was widely known in the art circles for his admiration and support of Cheong. He reportedly bought two to three paintings by Cheong every month and hung them in his office. Loke also gave some of those paintings to his business partners in Europe.23 Cheong's daughter Leng Guat recalled that Loke's secretary Talbot-Smith used to visit her father's studio periodically to select paintings, usually Chinese ink, for such gifts.24  Talbot-Smith also sometimes brought Cathay's guests to meet Cheong in his studio.25 His student Thomas Yeo recalled that in the late 1950s, many of Cheong's collectors were either British expatriates living in Singapore or friends introduced by Loke. Occasionally, Frank Sullivan and Michael Sullivan also brought visitors to his studio.26
A number of Cheong's mural commissions in the 1950s and 1960s such as those for Cathay Organisation (1955) and Singapore Telephone Board (1959), were also likely made possible through Loke's connections.27 Loke's support of Cheong in the 1950s during the Emergency period was helpful as this was a period when the British colonial government was generally suspicious of artists from China.28 Loke was well-regarded by the British elite in Singapore and on good terms with the then Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom in South East Asia, Malcolm MacDonald.29 The latter, who was also an admirer of Cheong's works, bought paintings for his own collection as well as to give to friends during his tenure in Singapore between 1946 and 1955.30
Over time, Loke and Cheong developed a warm and easy-going relationship. They met fairly regularly, usually conversing in Cantonese. The Cheong family used to visit the Lokes during Chinese New Year.31 Cheong also dropped in, sometimes unannounced, on Loke at his Cathay office to either show new works, or introduce promising young artists to him. Despite his busy schedule, Loke often made time to meet Cheong.32 By the time Cheong left for Europe in 1962, he was already quite a successful artist and sufficiently well off to embark on a two-year long trip.33 Loke continued his support in various ways. During Cheong's European trip, Loke together with others, helped to effect introductions to London galleries such as Frost and Reed, and Redfern, where Cheong eventually held his exhibitions.34 Through his networks with the media industry, Loke was also able to arrange a TV interview for Cheong in the United Kingdom.35 In addition, Loke used his wide business contacts to introduce Cheong to collectors in France and Italy.36
The Loke Collection
There are 12 works by Cheong in the NHB collection which were donated by Loke and his estate. Two paintings â€“ Balinese Selling Toddy (1954) and Bali Beach (1955) â€“ were most probably from the Frank Sullivan collection which Loke purchased in 1957.

These two works were likely acquired earlier by Sullivan when he helped to organise Cheong's first solo show in Singapore in 1956.37 The 12 works do not represent an exhaustive list of Cheong's paintings acquired by Loke. There are probably more works in the collections of Cathay Organisation and the extended Loke family.38 However, they do provide a useful glimpse into the range of paintings Cheong produced after his arrival in Singapore in 1946 and prior to Loke's demise in 1964. They also reflect the types of works that attracted the attention of key patrons like Loke and Sullivan, and conceivably other collectors and admirers of the period. The latter would include personalities in Singapore such as Malcolm MacDonald, Michael Sullivan, Madeleine Enright, Ann Talbot-Smith and Ho Kok Hoe, and those in Malaysia like P.G. Lim, Kington Loo and Loh Cheng Chuan.39
The paintings, evenly divided between six works done in oils and the rest on paper (either Chinese ink or watercolours), amply demonstrate Cheong's proficiency in both Western and Chinese art traditions. Figurative works predominate, with only two landscapes and one still-life. Most of the figurative paintings feature scenes based on rural life such as Indian men tending cows or a Balinese selling toddy (a form of coconut wine). Others highlight local women (be they Malay, Balinese or Kenyah) in traditional dress. In these pictures, the women are usually shown against a backdrop of Southeast Asian motifs like palm fronds, tropical fruits, painted boats and oral patterned batik (a form of wax-resist dyed fabric).
The two landscapes depict scenes drawn from Cheong's immediate surroundings. One shows a row of riverside shophouses â€“ most likely along Singapore River â€“ with boats and cars in the foreground. The other captures rustic wooden houses nestled amongst coconut trees with two Malay women in the foreground. These subjects convey an identity that is distinctly Southeast Asian. Consider the painting of a street vendor surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. The hawker's loose singlet and wide-brimmed hat, together with the adjacent shirtless boy, hint at the hot and humid setting of the scene. Likewise for the painting of Singapore River â€“ whilst the building facades may look European, the colourful green and red tongkangs (a form of cargo boats) bobbing in the waters are a reminder that such vessels are usually only found in this part of the world.
Such localised or Malayan themes were adopted by many local artists from the 1940s to the 1960s, both in response to their immediate physical environment as well as the growing interest in asserting a local identity. Such subjects were also consistent with the then British colonial authority's attempts to create a shared Malayan culture amongst the local populace. Many expatriate collectors would have, understandably, also preferred works with explicitly local subjects as a reminder of the times they had spent in the region. As one of Cheong's admirers Malcolm MacDonald had put it, â€œ...whenever I contemplate one or another of them (Cheong's paintings) I imagine that I had suddenly dropped in at a kampong in Malaya, a sea-shore resort on Singapore island, or a Dayak longhouse in the jungly interior of Sarawak.â€40 Such was the evocative powers of Cheong's works!
Lastly, an examination of three paintings featuring female figures (Bali Beach, Woman Lying Down and Untitled [Girl with Birdcage]) reveals Cheong's innovative approaches between the late 1940s and early 1960s, which so captured his patrons' attention. Whilst all three ostensibly depict similar subjects, the media and styles could not be more different. In the painting Bali Beach, Cheong demonstrated his proficiency with a Western medium, namely oil, and the stylistic features of key Western movements such as Primitivism, Cubism, Fauvism and Expressionism. He moved away from a straightforward representation of two topless women by reducing the female forms into simple graceful lines. The latter recall the sculpted features of indigenous wooden figurines as well as the rustic quality of the local way of life. The beach setting is captured by blocks of roughly applied brown, ochre and cream paint.
The blocks in turn form an interlocking design of angular planes which convey the effect of shifting light cast upon an undulating surface. Cheong also used strong bold colours, forming exaggerated contrasts, in order to accentuate the intensity of light and decorativeness of the tropics. Whilst the two ladies repose serenely on the beach, there is a sense of immediacy as certain elements such the boat, the basket of fruits and the lying woman's feet have been cropped out by the picture's edge, akin to the framing of a camera's lens. The scene also pulsates with tropical fervour through Cheong's application of paint in strong expressive strokes. Details like the patterns on the sarong (a loose garment made of a long strip of cloth wrapped around the body) worn by the seated female are sketched with quick fluid flourishes, suggestive of an individualistic spontaneity.
Cheong was also equally at home with Chinese ink painting. In Woman Lying Down, he used the long horizontal format associated with Chinese traditional hand scrolls. The latter are conventionally associated with landscape painting where a viewer is meant to experience travelling through the mountains and rivers as the landscape is slowly unrolled with the scroll. However, in this case, Cheong chose the subject of a reclining female which is usually more associated with the Western figurative paintings of Gauguin or Matisse, both known for their depictions of females in exotic locales. In this picture, Cheong had conveyed the feminine charm of his model through soft lyrical lines in ink. The Southeast Asian setting was captured through his careful attention to the woman's elongated ears weighed down by heavy earrings and her oral patterned sarong. The figure's affinity to nature is suggested by the large banana leaf on which she rests, whilst her rural occupation seems to be hinted at, by what appears to be a round woven tray in the background. The relatively flat colour washes used for the figure are in sharp contrast with her background which is completely filled with varying shades of ink. These, apart from bringing the female form into sharp relief, also provides an amorphous setting that alternately suggests receding depth as well as shifting light and shadow, constantly in flux.

Unlike Woman Lying Down which is a fairly representational depiction of a female figure, Cheong used a very different approach in the third work Untitled (Girl with Birdcage). It is also an ink painting but this time, the vertical composition is akin to the traditional hanging scroll format. Here, a standing woman is seen in the foreground and her Southeast Asian setting is suggested by her dress and headwear. The female form is now somewhat distorted through the elongation of her neck and arms as well as her heavily lidded eyes. Another person is seen peering through a curtained window in the top left corner of the painting, beside which hangs two birdcages, a common sight in many rural Malay homes. In this work, Cheong departed from Chinese painting aesthetics which conventionally dictate that parts of the paper surface should be left unpainted to suggest the physical setting of subjects, be it the ground, sky or water. Here, Cheong had almost filled up the painting surface with a grid of heavy ink lines and blocks of greens, blues, purples, pinks, browns and greys. Most interestingly, Cheong integrated the two figures into the overall composition of rectilinear blocks, which even extended to the woman's dress. The grid-like pattern recalls the abstract works of Mondrian but, at the same time, also conveys the patchwork quality seen in many wooden stilted houses in Malay villages. The latter often use wooden planks for construction of its walls, which are then painted in bright colours.

These three works amply exemplify how Cheong was able to bring together diverse media, techniques and approaches drawn from many art traditions, in order to capture slices of Southeast Asian life. In an era where the modern artist was celebrated for innovation, Cheong was able to assert his identity as a modern Asian artist in several ways. Firstly, his links with Asia were maintained through his foundation in Chinese ink painting tradition. At the same time, he was able to demonstrate his knowledge of international trends, particularly in Western modern art, both in his oil paintings as well as his innovative Chinese paintings. Thirdly, his Southeast Asian subjects also reflected his immediate reality, both physical and social, which in turn helped to connect him with his audiences in Singapore. As the art historian Michael Sullivan had succinctly put it in 1960, â€œHis work is modern, yet not beyond the understanding of people of any feeling. It is influenced by modern art, but is by no means an imitation of it. It depicts the Malayan scene and yet does not merely illustrate or record it. It is, in fact, a true expression of the feelings of an artist who is at one with the world he lives in.â€41

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Billy-Wong-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"For 67-year-old Billy Wong, photography has been a passion and his one-and-only job since he completed National Service in 1975. He learnt photography from a professional photographer by serving as his assistant for five years before becoming a full-fledged photographer himself. Back then, aided by his background in Graphic Design, he took pictures for events and of commercial products.
Today, he still does freelance photography and, with more flexible working hours, contributes his talent as a volunteer as well.
â€œI started volunteering because of my wife's keen interest. She said I had too much free time, and wanted me to get busy,â€ he recalls with a chuckle. His wife, Susan, is a freelance tour guide. She is a Heritage Volunteer who organises and helps out with the logistics of museum events.
Together, through an online portal, giving.sg, they embarked on a volunteering journey to do something meaningful. He adds simply, â€œWe just see what organisations need and try to meet the need.â€
Rich experiences
Billy started off as a volunteer guide in 2014, giving tours to children and senior citizens. Later, he started volunteering his expertise in photography, and has since been serving actively as an event photographer.
Apart from volunteering with the National Heritage Board, Billy also volunteers for the Singapore Red Cross Society during its road shows and blood donation drives. He helps the Very Special Arts (Singapore) with their art classes, music lessons, and speech-and-drama sessions for children. He finds working with children with special needs very meaningful, and is awed by the children's expressions of their unique talents in various art forms.
Through shared experiences like these, he has made friends with other volunteers, with whom he often keeps in touch after the events. Billy finds that volunteering keeps him connected with what is happening in the world.
Challenging and fulfilling
The dim lighting conditions of a museum and not being allowed to use the flash, yet needing to capture that perfect fleeting moment, truly put his skills as a photographer to the test.
â€œMy friends ask, â€˜Why spend so much time taking a photo?' They don't know the most challenging part is concentrating, paying attention and trying not to miss any action. In events, things happen very fast. You really have to anticipate the next move â€” what's going to happen next. You need to spend time preparing and concentrating. That's how you capture a nice picture.â€
Besides the technical challenges, what Billy really loves about volunteering is interacting with visitors both young and old.
â€œSometimes, there are senior citizens on wheelchairs. They need extra care. It's also challenging because many speak different dialects like Hokkien and Teochew. I only know Cantonese, and not too fluently. And so, usually end up speaking in Mandarin,â€ he explains with a rueful smile.
Despite the language barrier, Billy manages to connect with them. He is also grateful for the many foreign volunteers, for instance, from India and the Philippines who can communicate with visitors in their native languages.
Connecting with the past
One of his favourite places within the National Museum is the Singapore History Gallery. It showcases the living quarters of the working class in olden-day Singapore, life along the Singapore River, and stories of the forefathers of Singapore.
â€œIt is the senior citizens who will relate their experiences to us, docents! They can relate with the exhibits and it brings back memories to them: carrying rice, going through hard times to feed their families... When you talk to them, they feel emotional about the past. Some of their stories are quite sad as their lives were very tough.â€
â€œI learnt a lot in the process â€” we should be quite happy (with life) and not complain so much now. I also learnt more about the exhibits. The ACM (Asian Civilisation Museum) changes their exhibits often,â€ he explains. â€œWe acquire new knowledge after every change!â€
Joy in connecting
As a father to a grown son and a grandfather to a five-month-old baby, Billy has a soft spot for children. He finds interactions with young visitors especially endearing. He explains that the children are very curious and often make funny faces when he takes pictures. After photographing them, they clamour to look and get excited about the shots.
â€œSome will exclaim, â€˜Wah, very nice!' Sometimes, you will encounter very shy children. When you try to take their photo, they will hide from you. When I manage to capture a special moment and show it to them, they start to open up and interact.â€ He finds this heartwarming because breaking the ice and connecting with a stranger is probably not easy for them.
â€œI hope that when they see the photos, they will recall their time at the exhibition and remember this uncle. Maybe one day, they will also want to be a volunteer and give back to society.â€
Own favourites
Of the pictures he has taken, some of his favourites include captured moments of funny gestures when children talk to one another and volunteers enthusiastically interact with children. He fondly recalls a tour of Little India with the young ones.
â€œLittle India has very nice, colourful buildings. Volunteers were interacting with the children and showing them the five-foot way of pre-war shop houses. In the backdrop, there was a mural depicting the Indian vanishing trades: like the fortune tellers, dhoby men, flower garland makers... I took some nice shots there.â€
Perhaps it was the contrast between a present moment against the backdrop of a nearly forgotten era that made the pictures especially poignant and nostalgic for him.
Billy continues to use his camera not just as an aesthetic tool or a means to chronicle history, but also as a bridge between himself and a younger generation. â€œAs long as I am fit, I will continue volunteering. This is a good way to spend my time instead of hanging around aimlessly.â€
To others considering volunteering, Billy has this to say, â€œWhen you volunteer, you need to come with an open mind. Don't expect too much. Instead, see how you can help. After that, just enjoy the experience.â€

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 4 â€“ Oct to Dec 2010
Let us begin by asking ourselves a rather simple, if mundane, question: Why is it that when we survey the vast repertoire of batik styles and motifs we often come across certain patterns that are rather loud and crude in the manner they are rendered? And how come some of these patterns â€“ such as the parang rusak or â€˜broken sword', which happens to be one of the â€˜larangan' (forbidden) patterns traditionally restricted to the royalty and aristocracy â€“ were regarded as special and their use limited to the exclusive confines of the palace?

Numerous theories have been advanced to explain this discrepancy in style and taste, and this article does not in any way claim to hold the final answer to the riddle. However we propose that in order to answer the question we need to remind ourselves of what batik is and how it ought to be understood â€“ and more crucially read â€“ as more than just pieces of hand-waxed and painted cloth, but rather as narratives containing statements about the wearer of the batik and the world around him or her. Batik is, in short, a form of visual and textual narrative that can be read (after all, batik is written, remember1) and the answers to the questions that it poses before the eye of the modern viewer can be found in the material itself.
BATIK IN TIME, SPACE AND SOCIETY
First of all, let us situate batik in its proper historical-social context: Like language, batik was the lingua franca of the peoples of Southeast Asia and batiks produced in Java and Sumatra were eagerly bought and used by not only the Javanese and Sumatrans but also the communities of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sulawesi and other parts of the Malay archipelago.
However it is to Java that we need to turn to if we are to locate batik in its original setting where the motifs and patterns of the cloth are to be understood and deciphered properly. For it was in Java â€“ particularly between the 18th and 20th centuries â€“ where a highly complex and plural cosmopolitan society emerged that was internally differentiated along the lines of class, wealth, political status and loyalties, ethnicity, language and religion. And in this overdetermined social environment where symbols and markers were constantly being contested and in a state of flux that the motifs and patterns of batik were used as markers of identity and difference.
Elsewhere, we have talked about batik as a marker of ethnic, class, gender and religious identity. But in our attempt to understand and account for the variations of patterns and motifs, and why some were bolder and cruder while others were finer and softer, we need to understand the complex web of social relations and the social hierarchies that were dominant in Javanese society then.
For a start, let us go back to our first question above: Why is it that some of the restricted â€˜royal' patterns and motifs seem cruder than their socially inferior counterparts? Of course it beggars belief to suggest that the Rajas of Java could not afford the finest batiks of the land; and it goes without saying that the workshops and ateliers of the royal houses did produce some of the most sophisticated batiks of Central and Eastern Java. So, why were patterns like the parang rusak deemed preferable to kings, nobles and aristocrats?
THE FABRIC OF A COMMUNITY
Answering such a question necessitates some imagination on our part, and having to imagine how batik was worn, and where and why. The bane of batik research today is the dearth of enough photographic data to show how batik was used on a daily, routine basis by people from all walks of life. In many private and public photo collections, we see batik being worn by those who were clearly posing to be photographed, in situations and settings that were hardly natural.
Nonetheless some leap of faith and suspension of disbelief is required when we try to imagine how batik was worn in the days when it was the common denominator of kings and peasants alike. Living at a time when batik was literally the fabric that held society together and when its use was universal, we need to remind ourselves of the double-faced nature of batik as the universal cloth of Southeast Asia. On the one hand it was the textile that served as the material lingua franca of various communities, but on the other hand, the distinctions between classes, ethnicities, gender and localities had to be inscribed in that same material.
So, if kings and peasants alike wore batik, the only way through which the uneven differentials of power and status between them could be materially reproduced in the public domain was in the material itself, notably its patterns. And in the patterns of batik we may begin to understand the Southeast Asian understanding of the concept of social space, social hierarchy and social distance as well.
CLOSING IN ON AN ANSWER: THE EFFECT OF DISTANCE
Take a look at a sample of parang rusak below and you may see what I mean: When looked at closely, the motif â€“ a simple, undulating repetitive pattern in a series of broken waves â€“ seems rather crude compared to the sumptuous batiks of Pekalongan, Kedungwuni, Cirebon or Kudus. Some older pieces of parang rusak batik give the impression that they were crudely drawn, almost as if the waxing needle was moved by the hands of an infant playing with a crayon. But therein precisely lies our error: for one is not meant to look at a piece of parang rusak close-up, but rather from a distance, and a respectful distance at that.
Parang rusuk pattern batik waistcloth or jarit (detail). Mid-20th century, Yogyakarta, Central Java. Collection of the Asian Civilisations Museum.
Indeed, the intended visual effect of the parang rusak motif is only evident when viewed from a distance (of say, 10 meters or more) and not when it is held in our hands. The same batik which appears crude when held before our eyes has a more arresting effect when viewed from a distance, and this implies that it is meant to be seen from afar; in turn, this implies that spatial distance is part and parcel of the batik's pattern and effect. This in turn tells us something about the person who wore it (a king or noble) and those who viewed it. From a respectable distance the effect of a parang rusak motif is striking: what appears as a crude representation of broken waves takes on the appearance of graceful undulations that exude order and regularity â€“ precisely the intended effect of the cloth's pattern and presumably the intended role of the ruling elite as well, who were meant to embody and perpetuate the order of Javanese traditional society.
By locating ourselves in the social milieu where batik was worn thus, we begin to understand the complex web of social relations that were crucial to the maintenance of order, social norms and values of this highly conservative and traditional society. It was not an accident that the parang rusak motif was the preferred motif of the aristocracy, in the same way that the mega mendung motif below was likewise the pattern of royal batiks at the court of Cirebon. Both motifs appear crude when viewed up close, but regal and solid from a distance.

Social distancing and the maintenance of social hierarchies were thus part of the function of batik in traditional Javanese society, and such batiks made sense to those who lived in the context of a traditional society where the repertoire of symbols would be available to those who understood how to decipher its hidden meaning.
Such sartorial restrictions â€“ and the social norms and praxis that accompanied them â€“ did not apply to the communities of the north coast where there were no royal houses to set and maintain the standards of society. And in such a milieu, batik motifs and patterns played an altogether different role as they were markers not of social distance but rather social proximity and familiarity.
THE PESISIR BATIKS: A REVERSAL OF SPATIAL AND SOCIAL RELATIONS
The north coast ports and cities of Java were somewhat different from the royal capitals of Central Java as they had initially been small coastal settlements that only later rose to prominence as a result of colonial rule, international commerce and the settlement of many diverse diasporic communities including Europeans, Chinese, Indians and Arabs. Here a different sort of batik emerged as a result of the melange of different cultures that came together within the ambit of colonial race relations and a different mode of social ordering that was the result of mercantilism and transnational linkages. In time the batiks of the north coast cities would become the norm for most Javanese who lived in the more modern and cosmopolitan urban centres and they would gain recognition from other colonial centres including Malacca, Singapore, Penang and as far as Manila and Bangkok.
The social order of these hybrid colonial settlements was entirely different from that of the royal capitals where social hierarchies were accompanied by their own mode of social distancing and spatiality. The absence of traditional values and norms, as well as the sartorial rules and regulations that maintained the social order in traditional Javanese society meant that the inhabitants of these hybrid cosmopolitan centres could mingle with relative ease and inter-ethnic and inter-religious marriages and relations were not uncommon.
It should also be added that the political economy of these coastal port-cities was dependent on international commerce and not the traditional agrarian based economic production model that was the norm in central and eastern Java. As such, the standards that dictated the hierarchies of class and status were somewhat different, and the notion of cultural capital â€“ which often brings with it the weight of history and patrimony â€“ did not apply as much in these new social settings. As many of the wealthier members of such coastal settlements were self-made millionaires whose fortunes depended on trade and manufacturing, social markers of distinction in such settings were more often determined by the markers of capital and economic largesse. The new elite in places like Kedungwuni, Pekalongan, Kudus, Surabaya, Indramayu and Jepara were the landed merchant classes; and in some places â€“ like Kudus, the centre of the hugely profitable kretek (clove cigarette) industry â€“ the wealthy merchants had plenty of money to spare on land, furniture, automobiles and of course batik.
MADE FOR A CLOSER LOOK
If traditional central Javanese batik established social distance and hierarchies through a repertoire of restricted patterns that were meant to be viewed at a respectable distance, no such scruples applied in the cities of north coast Java. The opposite seems to have been the case, with batik producers in places like Kedungwuni, Pekalongan and Kudus producing batiks of such intricate detail that much of the finesse and sophistication is lost to the naked eye when the cloth is viewed from any distance beyond an arm's length. Indeed, one can only appreciate north coast batiks at their best when looking at them as closely as possible.
Let us compare two pieces of batik from the north coast of Java below. Seen from a distance of more than three metres, both tubular batik sarongs appear similar in appearance, composition and quality. The finery of the work and the detailed craftsmanship are lost when they are seen from a distance.

However, again we come to understand the meaning and value of such batik when we place ourselves in the same situational context in which they first appeared and were worn. Such batiks were made for women, and it has been established that social relations, networking and interaction among women in the colonial settlements were more relaxed than they were for Javanese women in the royal capitals. As such, one can imagine how and when such batiks were worn by the Eurasian, Chinese, Indian and Arab Peranakan women of the coastal towns; presumably during women-only gatherings like tea parties, lunches or the odd game of mah-jong.
It is precisely during such close encounters that the women of these Peranakan coastal communities would be able to stand literally next to their friends and/or rivals, and at close glance fully appreciate (or in some instances, envy) the elaborate details and ne workmanship of the batik worn by the person standing or sitting immediately next to her. One can only imagine the unstated tension and intense competition of batik aficionados who were determined to out-do their rivals at such gatherings, and the chagrin of the Madam who discovered to her horror that her sworn adversary had managed to get her hands on a priceless piece of batik from the workshop of Oey Soe Choen or Eliza van Zuylen! Such a discovery, however, could only be made up close, when both competitors were sitting eye-to-eye in front of each other...

THE DETAILS THAT MATTER
Now let us look at the two batiks again. The first happens to be a fine piece which was painstakingly hand-drawn with the aid of a canting, a wax pen used to draw ink onto the fabric (fig. 4a). The second is a run-of-the-mill batik from one of the many non-descript factories which churned out large volumes of batik for mass consumption, of standard value and presumably commanding a standard price (fig. 5a).
(fig. 4a) Detail of sarong
(fig. 5a) Detail of sarong
In an interesting inversion of the social rules of traditional Central Javanese society, the batiks of the north coast display an almost uniform character: despite the fact that they were produced in locations as far apart as Batavia (Jakarta) and Surabaya, the most common motif happens to be the somewhat static and monotonous buketan (bouquet) that was inspired by European oral motifs probably copied from children's drawing books or fashion catalogues imported from the West. Yet the difference between these batiks lie not in their overall format and composition but rather in the rendering of the flowers, birds, bees and butterflies we see in them, rendered in varying degrees of detail ranging from the crude and elementary to the mind-bogglingly precise and microscopic.
This difference in detail in turn served as the benchmark whereby the value and price of such batiks were estimated and sold, with the most detailed pieces commanding the highest prices. Needless to say, in wealthy circles such as those found among the merchants of Batavia and Kudus â€“ as well as Bantam, Singapore, Penang and Malacca â€“ the most expensive batiks that were produced by the workshops of the Pesisir soon found a ready market and a happy home for themselves.
In summing up, we need to remember that batik has to be understood in the situational context in which it found itself, and that understanding the meaning and import of batik motifs and patterns requires some understanding of how batik was situated in extended spatial-social relations where it could perform the social function it had: as a means of establishing social distance and proximity, and a way of keeping everything and everyone in their place. No mean feat for a piece of cloth.
1 Batik is written in the sense that we write it with a wax pen canting, not painted with a brush. Also until today in parts of Java the word batik literally means to write, as in â€˜batikin nama bapak dalam buku ini'.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Frozen-in-Time-Time-Capsules-in-Singapore/story,"Time capsules are like buried treasure chests in which items are preserved for the future. When opened, these time capsules provide us with snapshots of the eras during which they were buried.
Time capsules come in many shapes and sizes, but they all contain items that the people and institutions of Singapore have chosen to represent themselves and their milestones. These items also represent the way that the makers of the time capsules hope to be remembered.
NHB's Frozen in Time: Time Capsules in Singapore travelling exhibition in 2018 provided an overview of the history of time capsules in Singapore and offer interesting facts about some of these time capsules and their contents.
Watch: Frozen in Time: Time Capsules in Singapore 360 Video
In Singapore, many time capsules have been buried over the past 200 years, often to commemorate important events. These include time capsules buried during the colonial period, after Singapore's independence and even in recent years.
Singapore's oldest known time capsule was buried in 1843 and rediscovered by workers involved in the restoration of the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd. The capsule was found under the cathedral's foundation stone in 2016. Its contents reflected the diversity of the communities in Singapore even during the nation's early years.
The restoration of the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd back in 2016.
The items from this time capsule are now on display at the cathedral's heritage gallery. The gallery is open to visitors and also features other items which are of significance to the heritage of Singapore's Catholic community.
One time capsule from the colonial era provides insights into life in Singapore just before World War II. It was buried on 1 April 1937 under the foundation stone of the former Supreme Court, which is now part of the National Gallery Singapore.
The date on which the time capsule was buried marked the 70th anniversary of the Straits Settlements (now Singapore and parts of Malaysia) as a British Colony separate from India. The former Supreme Court itself was a symbol for justice and the rule of law under the British.
The time capsule is scheduled to be opened only in the year 3000 with the smashing of the foundation stone. This seven-foot stone forms part of the floor in the former Supreme Court building and visitors can still see it at the National Gallery Singapore today.
During the early years of Singapore's independence, a number of time capsules were launched. These time capsules contained items that symbolised the hopes of the young nation.
The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) created a time capsule focusing on Singapore's industrialisation and buried it under the Jurong Town Hall in 1974. JTC then used the Jurong Town Hall as its headquarters until 2000.
Similarly, the Science Centre Singapore created a time capsule and buried it in 1973 to track Singapore's progress over ten years. Among the 112 items inside the capsule were a black and white television, a camera and even samples of pig feed.
This capsule was opened and sealed again with more items in 1983, 2001 and 2013. The latest capsule is displayed in the Science Centre Singapore's Kinetic Garden and will be opened in 2027 on the centre's 50th anniversary.
National anniversaries are times of celebration and time capsules have often been part of the celebratory activities. Time capsules serve as milestones marking the nation's progress, and are often buried or opened during these anniversaries.

25 Years of Nation-Building Time Capsule
In 1984, Singapore celebrated its 25th year of self-government. As part of the celebrations, a national exhibition was organised and visitors voted on 25 (out of 40) items that would go into a time capsule. This capsule was then buried in front of the Singapore History Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore).
The 25 Years of Nation-Building Time Capsule contained the following items:
    Singapore 2015 Time Capsule
In 1990, another time capsule was buried in the front lawn of Empress Place to mark Singapore's 25th year of independence. This capsule contained 88 items that best symbolised Singapore's achievements.

  More recently, during Singapore's Golden Jubilee in 2015, or SG50, many organisations and institutions created their own time capsules. These contained items which were symbolic of Singapore's history at that point in time, reflective of the Singaporean identity as well as representative of the people's hopes for the country's future.
The official SG50 time capsule can be seen at: www.sg/SG50/timecapsule
Post-SG50, time capsules continue to capture the public's imagination and they are likely to endure as a popular means of commemorating important events and milestones in the present, for the future.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/a-game-of-thrones/a-game-of-thrones,"With great geographical benefits come great strife, as the power struggles between the 14th to the 17th centuries prove. The late 14th century saw Singapore being attacked. This compelled the Sultan to flee to Malacca, where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca, which Singapore became a part of. In 1511, Malacca fell to the Portuguese â€“ the dominant European power in the region at the time â€“ forcing its Sultan to retreat back south, where he established the Johor Sultanate. Singapore then fell under the rule of this Sultanate. In 1613, the Portuguese raided and burned the island to the ground, and for the next two centuries, Singapore faded into obscurity while still being nominally a part of the Johor Sultanate, eventually falling under regional Dutch control after the Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago.
When Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore with Major-General William Farquhar in January 1819, there were only about 1,000 inhabitants on the island, and they were greeted by a quiet that belied its eventful past. However, this did not stop Raffles from seeing Singapore's potential â€“ after all, he had heard so much about the place from his studies, and correspondence with Farquhar.
Sir Stamford Raffles
Fluent in Malay and having served as assistant secretary to the Governor of Penang at the age of 23, Raffles was familiar with the region's history and culture, and eventually served as the Lieutenant-Governor of Java. He had also written a book, The History of Java. All this knowledge and understanding led him to strongly believe in the importance of breaking the Dutch monopoly of trade in the region.
This portrait depicts Raffles as youthful, confident and knowledgeable, surrounded by symbols of his scholarly work: the manuscript paper in his hand, a writing desk with paper, ink and quill, and sculptures from Java.The original painting by George Francis Joseph was made after Raffles returned to England from Java in 1816, where he had been Lieutenant-Governor. (c. 1912. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
As the Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, Raffles sailed to Penang after gaining permission to secure a post for the British East India Company, on the condition that he would not antagonise the Dutch, especially with the rising Anglo-Dutch tensions against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars. However, Raffles was met with a lack of cooperation by the Governor of Penang, and he also learned that the Dutch were claiming all territories under the Johor Sultanate. But there was still a chance to claim Singapore, since they had not yet occupied the island.
Despite receiving instructions from his immediate supervisor â€“ the Governor of Penang â€“ to abandon his quest and await further orders, Raffles slipped onboard the Indiana to reunite with Farquhar, and they arrived in Singapore on 28th January 1819.
The events that followed took place in quick succession â€“ everything happened within ten days.
The succession dispute between Abdul Rahman and Hussein Shah
Upon their arrival, they found that Temenggong Abdul Rahman, the Governor of the Johor-Lingga-Riau Sultanate, was Head of the island. On 30th January 1819, the British and Temenggong Abdul Rahman came to a provisional agreement for the British to establish a trading post on the island. However, the area was under the charge of the Dutch and Bugis, who would never agree to a British base in Singapore. To prevent the Dutch from challenging the legality of this treaty, Raffles needed the endorsement of the Malay sovereign.
The reigning Sultan at the time was Tengku Abdul Rahman. Tengku Abdul Rahman was the second born son, and his older half-brother, Tengku Hussein Shah, should have been the rightful successor. However, Tengku Hussein Shah was away at Pahang at the time of the Sultan's passing in 1811, which led to his younger half-brother, Tengku Abdul Rahman, becoming Sultan instead.
The hasty coronation ceremony to instate Tengku Abdul Rahman as Sultan before Tengku Hussein Shah's return was organised with a politically-charged agenda by the leader of the Bugis faction, effectively aligning themselves with the Dutch. Tengku Hussein Shah remained in Pahang, clueless to these developments. He eventually found out, but with the Bugis faction now allies with the Dutch, and after being warned by the British in Malacca not to interfere in Riau-Lingga affairs, Tengku Hussein Shah and his supporters dropped all plans to challenge Sultan Abdul Rahman for the throne. Sultan Abdul Rahman was pressured to remain the Sultan despite his lack of interest and Tengku Hussein Shah went into exile in Riau.
Using the dispute
Aware of this dispute, Raffles struck a deal with Tengku Hussein Shah, knowing that this man had the support of the Malay chiefs in Riau and Pahang. It was a calculated move on his part, since Abdul Rahman was crowned by the Bugis faction that allied themselves with the Dutch, and this may have presented challenges in the negotiations for a British trading settlement in the region.
Raffles summoned Tengku Hussein Shah to Singapore, acknowledged him as the legitimate successor to the throne, and proclaimed him the Sultan of Johor. An official treaty was signed on 6th February 1819 with Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein Shah, which gave the British East India Company the right to operate a trading post in Singapore. This acknowledgement was beneficial for both the Temenggong and Sultan Hussein Shah. Both men were paid a handsome sum of money yearly to uphold this agreement.
This treaty was signed by Sir Stamford Raffles on 6th February 1819 with Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein Shah, to give the British East India Company (EIC) the right to set up a trading post in Singapore. (c. 1819. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
Raffles left Singapore the next day and he instructed Farquhar to take care of this new settlement as its Resident and Commandant.
The Dutch strike back
Though the events leading up to the 1819 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance were tumultuous, they paled in comparison to the commotion caused once the Dutch in Batavia got wind of this new British development. The Dutch went on to challenge the legality of the settlement, stating that the island had always been within their sphere of influence. However, the British stood their ground as they had begun to recognise Singapore's strategic value
This copper engraving illustrates a detailed city plan of Batavia (Jakarta), the Dutch capital of the Dutch East Indies. (c. 1660s. Image from Asian Civilisations Museum.)
As predicted, Singapore grew from a trading port to a trading settlement in the span of four months. Singapore became a regional gem â€“ attracting traders, merchants and pioneers from all over.
The Anglo-Dutch Treaty
Though it took years for the Dutch and the British to see eye to eye, Singapore's legal ambiguity was resolved in 1824 with the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. This treaty recognised British influence over Singapore and the Malay Peninsula. It also officially acknowledged Dutch authority to the south of Singapore and in the Indonesian archipelago.
A map of the British Settlements in the Malay Peninsula and Coast of Borneo (c. 1870. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
It can be argued that this resolution came about due in part to Raffles â€“ his act of acquiring Singapore took tensions to an all-time high and forced the relevant authorities to come to an agreement.
There would be other Anglo-Dutch treaties to come in the 1870s but for now, this chapter was closed.
Eventful and fast-paced, Sir Stamford Raffles played a key role in this significant turning point in Singapore's history, though some of his methods could be viewed as questionable.

BeMuse Volume 6 Issue 3 - Oct to Dec 2013
The Asian Civilisations Museum displayed over 170 new acquisitions in the special exhibition Devotion and Desire: Cross-Cultural Art in Asia which ran until 8 December 2013. Objects acquired over 2009 to 2013 were mounted in the exhibition, most for the first time. Many of these works of art revealed the surprising connections between Asian cultures, and between Asia and the wider world. The exhibition highlighted a new direction for the museum, which had recently focused on collecting objects that have resulted from these interconnections.
The themes of the exhibition include the importance of trade, transmission of religions, courtly art, and colonial networks. For thousands of years, the cultures of Asia have traded, interacted, and exchanged ideas. These encounters have shaped our world, and they affect the way objects look. Religions moved from region to region, special objects were eagerly sought in lands far away, and new works of art were created by the blending of different traditions.
What is cross-cultural art?
Defining cross-cultural art is complicated. Trying to understand, through our contemporary eyes, why an object looks the way it does often requires a supple mind and a familiarity with various artistic traditions. Many works of art were made by people who lived a world away from their intended consumers â€“ and, therefore, did not necessarily share a language, religion, or aesthetic. Meaning and context are generated in unexpected ways, with crucial roles played by traders, agents, and consumers of various types. Art historians sometimes try to pinpoint the earliest occurrence of a motif or style in order to identify the â€œoriginalâ€ source of influence. Although this may be a useful starting point, it can also obscure the influence of creativity by later artists.
Cross-cultural art can result from an artist using ideas and styles from a foreign culture in order to produce new work. Whether the process is called copying, borrowing, emulating, or appropriation is of no importance. What is important and exciting is the process â€“ the exchange of influences, whether facilitated by networks of trade, migration, pilgrimage, diplomacy, or any combination of these â€“ and, of course, the resulting works of art.
Devotion and Desire
Desire for wealth, hard-to-obtain commodities, adventure, and objects of beauty has driven trade and the movements of people for a very long time. Devotion to gods, principles, charismatic leaders, and indeed, craft and art-making, has been and still is a major driving force in civilizations around the globe. The objects in the exhibition are products of these forces, and tell fascinating stories of the past.
Peranakan art embodies this cross-cultural blending of ideas. As the descendants of foreign traders who settled and married local women, they adopted traits from their new home in the Malay world, while retaining much of their own culture, whether from China, India, or Europe. Peranakan art reflects diverse influences â€“ it incorporates a complex mixture of styles and objects made in different parts of the world, which were commissioned or collected, and displayed together in a new context. The Peranakans provide an example for looking at the world: they remind us to look beyond the strict notions of nationality and ethnicity to discover the value of diverse communities.
Many regions around the globe have been sites of exchange and blending. As peoples and religions spread to new lands, new adherents incorporate local customs into new belief. A spectacular example is the monumental head of a bodhisattva (fig. 1). Both the style and the religious significance of the work can be traced to other lands: it is a Buddhist figure, made in a style borrowed from Hellenistic art. It was made in the ancient kingdom of Gandhara (in what is today northern Pakistan), an important crossroads between East and West. Like the Malay Peninsula, it was a point of exchange for trade, religion, and art.

Alexander the Great conquered parts of the Gandhara region in the 4th century BC. The state later transferred to the Indian Mauryan dynasty, whose King Ashoka (272â€“237 BC) converted to Buddhism. A succession of Greek and Bactrian rulers followed, until a long period of ability began under the Kushan kingdom (late 1 century until around 450 CE). These waves of influences left two profound effects on Gandharan art: Buddhism; and the realistic depiction of the human form influenced by Greek and Roman art â€“ a mixture that gave rise to some of the earliest depictions of the Buddha and bodhisattvas.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Sikhism were all represented in works of art in the exhibition. Many of these objects are the result of varied artistic influence. For instance, Hinduism and Buddhism were transmitted from India to Southeast Asia in the first centuries of the Common Era. Imported ritual objects provided inspiration for local work, and Indian artists and merchants settled in towns along the trade routes and contributed to the creative process.
Three images of the Virgin and Child show varied responses to Christianity in Asia. A porcelain model made at Dehua, China, with a base of swirling Chinese-style clouds, melds elements of Guanyin with the Virgin Mary (fig. 2).
Fig. 2. Virgin and Child, China, Dehua, Fujian province, late 17th or 18th century, Porcelain, height 39 cm.
An ivory sculpture shows the extraordinary skills of Sri Lankan carvers who worked for both Christian and Buddhist patrons (fig. 3).
Fig. 3. Virgin and Child, Sri Lanka, late 16th century, Ivory, height 32.5 cm.
And a wooden Virgin and Child crafted in Timor-Leste is an example of a local artist's interpretation of a Western sculptural style (fig. 4).
Fig. 4. Virgin and Child, Probably Timor-Leste, 19th century, Wood, pigments, height 73.7 cm.
The three sculptures all depict the same subject, but the stories of how they came to be are worlds apart.
Local religions dominate another section of the exhibition. In many cultures, ancestors are deeply respected and venerated. If properly attended to, ancestors would shower blessings upon the community and ensure bountiful harvests. In ancient China, vessels cast of bronze were used to offer food and wine during rituals dedicated to ancestors and the gods. Ritual vessels like a gui (fig. 5), richly decorated and exceptionally well preserved, were used by the elite. An array of impressive ritual bronzes was a display of power and prestige. These bronzes were often later buried in the tombs of their owners. Ancestor rituals not only showed respect but also emphasized the source of a ruler's political authority.

The Austronesian peoples of Southeast Asia often represented their ancestors by producing figures made from wood, stone, or metal. Some are extremely simple â€“ others grand and beautifully carved. A Hampatong guardian figure from central Borneo takes the form of a colonial-era soldier in Western- style military uniform (fig. 6). This shows that the Dayaks would even use powers from the world outside their community to ward off intruders from the spirit world.
Fig. 6. Hampatong guardian figure, Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), early 20th century, Ironwood, height 170 cm.
The desire to obtain money and goods through commerce has spurred the movements of people around the world for millennia. Much of the trade through the Indian Ocean centred around textiles from India and spices from Southeast Asia. A fine cotton textile (fig. 7), probably made for use as a bedspread or wall hanging, was produced on the Coromandel Coast of India. The bold floral patterns were popular in Europe at the time, and it was surely designed to appeal to that market.
Fig. 7. Hanging: Large flowers and cartouches, India, Coromandel Coast, early 18th century, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed, 277 x 170.6cm.
Porcelain and other goods from China were also coveted by much of the world, and for a time, the trade was strictly controlled. On display was a large bowl decorated with scenes of the lively waterfront at Guangzhou (Canton), the busiest trading port by the mid-18th century (fig. 8). Western trading companies were restricted to the â€œhongsâ€, as they were called, offices and residences abutting the port. Hong bowls like this were produced by Chinese artisans as souvenirs for wealthy foreign merchants.
Fig. 8. Hong Bowl, China, around 1785, Porcelain, height 15.5 cm, diameter 36 cm.
Luxury goods made from tortoise shell, ivory, mother-of-pearl, silver and gold â€“ even exotic woods â€“ drove markets for art in many places. A small chest covered with iridescent mother-of-pearl plaques mounted with silver pins was produced in Gujarat in western India (fig. 9). Collectors in Renaissance Europe were dazzled by such objects, which could be found in princely collections throughout the region.
Fig. 9. Casket, India, Gujarat, 16th or 17th century, Mother-of-pearl, wood, gilded silver pins, engraved metal mounts, 15.5 x 23.5 x 13 cm.
It is perhaps appropriate to return to Peranakan art to complete the circle. A full-length portrait painted in oil of Madam Wellington Koo embodies the shifting identities of Peranakans in the modern world (fig. 10).
Fig. 10. Portrait of Madam Wellington Koo, By Charles Tharp (British, 1878 - 1951), 1921, Oil on canvas, 197 x 100 cm, Gift of Lim and Tan Securities Pte Ltd in memory of Johnny and Nancy Lim.
Born at the turn of the century into a wealthy family in Java, Oei Hui-lan (1899â€“1992) grew up there and in Singapore, speaking multiple languages, and learning to negotiate the colonial society of the day. She married Wellington Koo, an American-educated Chinese diplomat, and they lived at postings in Europe and America. Madam Koo moved easily through high society in the East and the West. Featured in Vogue magazine, she was equally comfortable in haute couture or the sarong kebaya; the shops of Paris, or the dusty streets of Java. And thus, we might view her as another in a long line of adventurers, traders, and negotiators along the many paths that combine cultures around the world. These interactions can produce works of great beauty. Some of them were on display here in Singapore in the past exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum.

Be Muse Volume 6 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2013
Tucked way behind the borders of Singapore's shopping district is Tiong Bahru, a quaint and charming housing estate dotted with eclectic independent shops as well as eateries old and new. Popularly known for its food offerings and distinctive architecture, Tiong Bahru as become one of Singapore's most sought-after residences as many people have rediscovered in recent years the unique attractions of a laid-back, low-rise neighbourhood.
On 14 April 2013, the National Heritage Board (NHB) launched its 11th heritage trail to uncover the rich history and fascinating stories behind Tiong Bahru, which the public can now explore through a walking trail spanning the conserved housing area and its nearby surroundings. Tracing Tiong Bahru from its beginnings as an adjoining cemetery to a gravesite known as Teong Lama - literally 'Old Cemetery' - the trail sheds light on the social history and remarkable evolution of the estate, its unique Art Deco flats and shophouses, other landmarks past and present, as well as the people, trades, eateries and events that have helped shaped the community in Tiong Bahru.
FROM BURIAL GROUND TO BUSTLING DESTINATION
There is definitely more to Tiong Bahru than meets the eye. As the third public housing project developed by the Singapore Improvement Trust or SIT, Kampong Tiong Bahru, as it was known then, was transformed from a Chinese burial ground to a thriving residential estate. Today, there are no traces of he swamps, hills and graves that once dotted the area around Tiong Bahru Road from the mid-19th century until the 1930s, but many other aspects of the past can still be seen in and around the estate and are highlighted by informative storyboards and markers placed by these historic sites.
One hidden nugget that even regular visitors and residents may not have known about is an air-raid shelter located right under the flats of Block 78 Moh Guan Terrace. This vacant space, which was for a time used as a rubbish disposal site, was in fact the large public air-raid shelter in Singapore and the only on to be built as part of a public housing project. The shelter, dug in 1939, could accommodate up to 1,600 people but was seldom used as Tiong Bahru was not a major target for Japanese bombs during the Second World War.
Another oft overlooked historical site lies at the outskirts of Tiong Bahru along Outram Road, across the road from a petrol kiosk and Tan Boon Liat Building. Here, on a wooded hill long abandoned and ignored by passers-by, rest the remains of philanthropist Tan Tock Seng (1798-1850), his daughter-in-law Chua Seah Neo (d. 1882) and granddaughter-in-law Wuing Neo (d. 1882). The same hillock was also the location of a thriving Chinese-medium school called Gongshang, which operated at the site from 1930 till 1988.
Other former landmarks have vanished or changed beyond recognition. Visitors will learn from the trail about the history of a site at the junction of Seng Poh and Tiong Bahru Roads, where a small temple stood between 1918 and 2006. This Chinese temple was a major feature of the neighbourhood due to a large red hulu or gourd-shaped incense burner placed outside the shrine. Right across the road from the temple was a very popular bird corner that used to draw people from all over the island to listen to the songs of feathered pets as well as enjoy meals at a coffeeshop beside the bird corner.
The site of the former Seng Poh Road Market is also a very different sight from the past; the cramped old market has given way to a spacious food centre and wet market, where many stallholders from the older market continue to prepare and serve popular hawker fare such as fried kway teow, Hokkien prawn noodles, wanton mee, chwee kueh, porridge and traditional snacks. Visitors can read about the individual stallholders, their history and culinary specialties in a brochure that presents the Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail in detail, which can be accessed here.
These are just a few of the many highlights of the trail, which is designed to tell the story of Tiong Bahru and chart the milestones of its development in a way that reflects the spirit and character of the community, including the personal memories of present and past residents. To this day, the physical and social landscape Tiong Bahru is still evolving, as new residents, businesses and visitors arrive and interact with each other as well as older establishments. The conservation status granted to the housing estate, however, paves the way for a harmonious blend of the classic and contemporary, as new eateries and retailers move into the pre-war shophouses, injecting new life into the estate while retaining its old-world, understated nature.
GUIDED BY VOLUNTEERS AND STUDENTS
The Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail also marked a number of â€˜firsts' for the NHB, which is working to engage Singaporeans in documenting and sharing about the history of the places where people live, work and play. The trail was the first to feature guided tours conducted by volunteer guides on a regular basis for the public. Some of these guides are themselves residents of Tiong Bahru who were keen to share their own stories about the neighbourhood, as they have lived in the estate for many years. These volunteer guides underwent training sessions organised by the NHB and also conducted their own research on the estate. The tours have proven popular with the public; within three weeks of the trail's launch in April, all sessions until August 2013 were fully booked.
The trail is also the first to be adopted by a school. Henderson Secondary, which is located not too far away from the estate, adopted the Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail for two years and used it as an education platform. Students also served as the NHB's ambassadors in promoting the trail to other schools. The NHB also organized training sessions for students who were keen to act as guides for their peers. The heritage trail offered students a creative avenue to involve themselves with local history and further their understanding of Singapore's past, while honing their research and leadership skills.
LAUNCHING THE TIONG BAHRU TRAIL
On the morning of 14 April 2013, the basketball court beside the Tiong Bahru Community Centre was turned into a site of festivities for the young and old, as a curious crowd explored colourful stalls, watched cultural performances put up by residents and enjoyed the privilege of being the first people to embark on the heritage trail. Volunteer guides, students and long-time residents led the guests through the estate, stopping at 10 markers and storyboards that showcase historical elements of Tiong Bahru and pointing out places and moments of significance. The launch of the trail was a day-long event of fun and celebration as residents and visitors alike gathered to celebrate the history and life of a com- munity with much to offer in stories and sights.
The Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail is a collaborative effort between the NHB, the Tiong Bahru Youth Executive Committee (TB YEC), and the Tiong Bahru Community Centre Management Committee. Launched in conjunction with a Tiong Bahru Heritage Fiesta organised by TB YEC, the event was graced by Guest-of-Honour Ms Indranee Rajah, in her capacity as Advisor to Tanjong Pagar GRC Grassroots Organisations. Approximately 1,000 people attended the event, including close to 200 invited guests and representatives of businesses and organisations located in the area, who were invited to walk on a modified trail route of the estate. As part of the tour, the guests had the opportunity to interact with Henderson Secondary students who were stationed at each heritage marker to introduce the guests to the site. These students had been trained by the NHB and conducted their own research to prepare for the launch. Their efforts certainly paid off as guests and students alike had an enriching time learning about the places they saw.
Many of the participants and guests also grabbed the chance to sign up for a guided walk of the trail. Two trail routes were available: one covered all ten heritage markers, while the other brought participants into the pre-war air-raid shelter at Blk 78 Moh Guan Terrace. With help from the HDB and Tanjong Pagar Town Council, the air-raid shelter was opened to the public for this special occasion. Adding a highly personal note to the tours were the volunteer guides, who shared their own research, experiences and stories with the participants.
Also at the launch to share her personal story was Ms Mary Pereira, who was born in the air-raid shelter at Moh Guan Terrace during an air raid in 1942. Ms Pereira's mother was taking cover in the shelter during the war when she suddenly went into labour. Thankfully, the shelter was equipped with medical facilities and had a doctor on site to attend to her. Ms Pereira was thus safely delivered and has shared her story with many others over the years, including the guests on the trail.
Many visitors were clearly enriched by the tours. Expressing his thoughts after going for the guided walk, Anthony Loke said he â€œdefinitely learned more about the history and community activity in Tiong Bahru in addition to the architectural information.â€ Another participant, Karen Phan, remarked that the guided tours help to make â€œTiong Bahru [a] living and growing museum.â€
The day-long launch event culminated in an outdoor movie screening that relived the old times back in the 1950s when the Tiong Bahru Community Centre would organise open-air film screenings for the community. Earlier, various community groups had set up booths selling snacks, handicrafts and fashion by the community centre. Occupying a prominent space was a stall by Urban Sketchers Singapore, a group of avid and energetic artists who focus on drawing various outdoor locations in Singapore. The Urban Sketchers had collaborated with the NHB to conduct a sketch-walk along the trail, with individual artists seated at various spots where they could capture the mood and atmosphere of the estate in beautiful artworks that were exhibited during the trail's launch. Paul Wang, a representative of the group, stated, â€œWe the Urban Sketchers had a really good time sketching Tiong Bahru. The event was well-organised and we appreciate NHB's hard work.â€
Another touch of artistry at the event came from fashion designer Elyn Wong of Stolen, a Singapore-based womens-wear label. For the launch, Ms Wong had created a designer tote bag featuring Tiong Bahru's distinctive Art Deco flats. The bags were sold during the Tiong Bahru Heritage Fiesta, with all proceeds going to the Tanjong Pager-Tiong Bahru Citizens' Consultative Committee Community Development and Welfare Fund to assist needy residents. The money collected from subsequent monthly guided trails, which require a nominal fee of two dollars per participant, will also go into this fund.
ROUTES TO DISCOVERING THE HEARTLANDS
As with earlier NHB community trails, the Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail was launched with the aim of engaging Singaporeans to learn and share about the heritage of the heartlands, as well as to document the unique histories and social memories of places and communities in different parts of Singapore. These trails chart old trades, businesses, schools and institutions as well as the diverse communities that have shaped the character of each place. As part of this effort, the NHB also encourages the community to actively contribute to the making of these trails. The result is that these trails include many human interest stories shared by old residents or business-owners, which provide first-hand accounts of important landmarks as well as events and changes that have taken place over the decades.
Another mission of the trails is to encourage the public to explore Singapore's heritage on their own, and at their own time and pace. Apart from the permanent markers and storyboards installed at major historical locations along the trails, the NHB has produced detailed brochures to accompany each heritage trail, which provide in-depth information about the neighbourhoods and sites of historical interest. Tiong Bahru is just one of many heritage trails launched by the NHB in recent years; other community trails cover places such as Kampong Glam, Balestier Road, Jalan Besar, Bukit Timah, Queenstown, Ang Mo Kio and Yishun/Sembawang. There are also heritage trails focusing on the downtown Civic District as well as sites of significance during the Second World War in Singapore. Together, these trails offer a fresh and exciting understanding of the Singapore Story.
The heritage trails serve not merely as channels to improve our knowledge about places in Singapore. They also provide a useful platform for heritage enthusiasts, researchers and schools to pursue further research into the history of particular places, peoples and trades. It is hoped that these trails will motivate the public to see Singapore's history in a fresh light and discover more about the past in their own backyards, and in doing so, make history into a pursuit and passion that is continuous, alive and enriching.

The first official census of 1824 recorded 756 Indians, 7% of the population of Singapore then. In just over a century, by 1931, the Indian population had grown to 50,000 people and continued to grow with time. The dynamic profile of Indian migrants included North as well as South Indians. The early migrants came as British troops or Sepoys, prisoners (political and otherwise) who contributed to Singapore's infrastructure, traders, plantation workers, professionals and civil servants, policemen, and even as performing artists and craftsmen. These early migrants founded empires and institutions; inspired their community and others; and fought for their rights and beliefs. The increasing number of Indians also gave birth to several associations and organisations that served their agendas of religion, business and trade, arts and culture and even social reform. These organisations continue to be instruments of social bonding and cultural interaction till today.
The Indian Heritage Centre has been delving into this early history of the Singapore Indian community â€“ in the absence of published records, oral history has been pivotal to curatorial research. The Somapah/Basapa family is a perfect example of this initiative.
These names were mentioned to me by every other member of the Indian community; he (Somapah) was a pioneer in the property business, they would say. The names kept returning to taunt me, yielding few returns to endless searches at various public archives. Until December 2011, when I found, quite by accident, a family history website created that year by the family of Thomas Augustine (T.A.) Basapa (1917-2010), following his demise. T.A. Basapa was the grandson of Hunmah Somapah (d. 1919) and the son of William Lawrence Soma (W.L.S.) Basapa (1893-1943). With names, context and places made explicit in the content of the website, the public archive search (which included the collections of the National Museum of Singapore, the then Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research and newspapers in Singapore) became more rewarding. I also managed to locate T.A. Basapa's son Lawrence Basapa, who kindly agreed to be interviewed on the family's history. Lawrence Basapa has since donated digital copies of photographs from the family album for display at the Indian Heritage Centre.
A part of my research findings are compiled below into a short narrative on W.L.S. Basapa (Hunmah Somapah's son) and his passion for collecting animals, which led to his establishing of Singapore's first private zoo as well as his contributions to the erstwhile Raffles Museum. Curatorial research on the Somapah/Basapa family forms part of the content for the Indian Heritage Centre's permanent gallery on Indian Pioneers in Singapore. Please visit us at the junction of Campbell Lane and Clive Street to know more about this remarkable individual and other Indian pioneers in Singapore. The Heritage Institutions Division under the National Heritage Board has also produced a travelling exhibition on Singapore's Early Zoo which features photographs and the history of the first Singapore zoo at Punggol. The exhibition was launched at the Singapore Zoo in April 2013 and travelled to three National and Public Libraries in Singapore.
W.L.S. Basapa: Pioneer and Collector
Hunmah Somapah was a landowner and municipal official. The Somapah estate owned properties in the Serangoon Road and Changi areas. Upon Somapah's death, W.L.S. Basapa became a trustee of the Somapah estate and inherited his father's residence at 317 Serangoon Road. It was at his Serangoon estate that he began, between the period 1920 and 1922, to collect several species of animals and birds.
To accommodate his growing collection of animals and birds, Basapa acquired 11 hectares of seafront land at Punggol. In 1928, he relocated his collection to Punggol and started the Singapore Zoological Gardens and Bird Park at Punggol (also known as the Punggol Zoo).
It took ten years for Basapa to transform the muddy and overgrown piece of land in Punggol into a full- fledged zoo. At the rate of S$35 per day, Basapa maintained the zoo privately from 1928 until the start of World War II. Basapa was a man of foresight who forged international connections to create the best displays at the zoo. For instance, Basapa imported a stunning black leopard (announced as a Black Panther in a 1937 Straits Times article) for the Punggol Zoo from Sydney's Taronga Park Zoo in 1937. This was part of an animal exchange plan devised between the two zoos. He also brought in exotic animals from South Africa, America and Australia, and eventually built up a collection of 200 animals and 2,000 birds for the Punggol Zoo.
The zoo was a major attraction in pre-war Singapore and charged a nominal entrance fee of 40 cents. It even gave discounts of up to 75% off the entrance fee for students. In fact, the Punggol Zoo was known the world over, and even locally, as the Singapore Zoo â€“ the first to be called so.
At the start of World War II, the British moved their forces to the North of Singapore in anticipation of the Japanese onslaught and occupied the site of the Punggol Zoo. Basapa was given 24 hours to vacate his animals and birds, and given the short time span, was unable to save all of his animals. The British freed the birds and harmless animals and shot the more dangerous ones.
During the Japanese occupation, the Punggol Zoo became the location for the Japanese mess, and Basapa eventually died in 1943, a broken-hearted man. The Punggol Zoo was not restarted by the Basapa family after the war.
In his lifetime, Basapa made periodic, almost annual, donations to the Raffles Museum between the years 1924 and 1938. These donations included animal skins and mounted specimens of animals that had died at Basapa's home zoo at Serangoon Road and later at the Punggol Zoo. The Raffles Museum's annual reports (in the collection of the National Museum of Singapore) mention Basapa's generous donations to the Museum's collection of zoological specimens. More than 80 specimens donated by Basapa were later inherited by the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (now Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, National University of Singapore) from the former Raffles Museum and are still part of the museum's collection.

Milestones of the Punggol Zoo
According to contemporary newspaper articles, the famous physicist Albert Einstein visited Singapore in November 1922 to raise funds for a proposed Hebrew University in Jerusalem. His notes on this visit mentioned his passing through â€œSingapore's Zoological Gardensâ€. This is possibly a reference to Basapa's private home zoo located at 317 Serangoon Road.
Basapa's Punggol Zoo was commended by Sir Roland Braddell in his 1934 book Lights of Singapore. Braddell also mentioned Basapa's â€œmagnificent collection of birdsâ€, his orang-utans and a pet tiger named Apay that could be led around by a chain even though he was four years old.
In March 1930, the Punggol Zoo imported seals into the British colony of Singapore. This marked the first time members of the public could view these marine creatures in a public zoo.
A 1933 American film titled â€œDyakâ€ starring English actor M.H. Kenyon-Slade was shot at the Punggol Zoo. Kenyon-Slade was filmed fighting a dead python in a battle which was regarded as one of the high points of the film.
In February 1935, the newspapers reported that the Punggol Zoo had received several Arabian camels, black swans and Shetland ponies from the Perth Zoo. The following year, the Punggol Zoo produced advertisements to promote a cafÃ© that served afternoon tea at the Zoo. The cafÃ© was in fact an open-air â€œrefreshment roomâ€ that served tea, biscuits and lemonade at a low price.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010
Football is widely considered the most popular sport in the world. From 11 June to 11 July 2010, people of different nations and cultures were watching the FIFA World Cup â€“ the most prestigious and anticipated football event in the world. The previous World Cup tournament held in 2006 drew and amazing viewership of 26.3 billion.
In fact, the appeal of football goes back thousands of years. Archaeologists have unearthed evidence of earlier versions of football played by ancient civilisations across the globe, including Ancient Rome, Greece and China.
Cuju was played by Chinese soldiers as part of their fitness training more than 2,000 years ago. It later became a favourite game of both men and women from the upper class of Chinese society.
Ancient Greeks and Romans of both genders played ball games to keep fit.
The ancient Mayans of Central America enjoyed a ball game which required players to hit the ball with their shoulders, arms, shins and hips. Sometimes, the ball was substituted with the head of an unlucky enemy.
However, modern football was first played in England in the 19th century. It is believed to have originated in public schools for boys as an extra-curricular activity to bring about discipline and foster team spirit.
THE MASS APPEAL OF MOB FOOTBALL
In medieval Britain and France, large-scale and often riotous ball games were popular with the masses. They were played by many players, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, with few restrictions. Divided into teams, the participants had to get the ball to its destination with their hands and feet. The unruliness of the games caused King Edward II (1284 to 1327) of England to officially ban them in 1314.
In 1477, King Edward IV (1442 to 1483) explicitly forbade the playing of football and other games as they were distracting the people from practising archery which was deemed a necessity in wars. Despite royal disapproval, mob football continued to be enjoyed by the people until the 19th century when a new version of the game emerged.
THE BIRTH OF MODERN FOOTBALL
British public schools in the 19th century catered to the aristocrats and the nouveau rich. The students harboured a sense of social superiority over the staff which sometimes made controlling them a nightmare. Compulsory games were introduced to bring about some discipline and divert the excess energy of the hormonally charged teenagers. Unsurprisingly, traditional football with its chaotic and boisterous nature became popular. Games were held to improve staff-student relations, forge school unity and promote the notion of putting the institution before oneself.
Each school had their own football rules that were at first passed down orally. The sport became more organised with the formation of houses, colours and contests. The first set of rules was written in 1846 at Rugby School in Warwickshire.
Former public school boys spread the game to Oxford and Cambridge when they entered university and promoted the sport in the army. Some even went on to set up their own football clubs, with each having their own rules. Some favoured a rugby style of playing while others forbade touching the ball with the hands. During matches, the first half of the game could be played under the rules favoured by one club while the second half would adhere to the rules of the other club.
Researchers have found that organised football matches were held outside the world of public schools as well. These games, which often involved betting, took place all over Britain.
In 1862, representatives of leading football clubs met to standardise the football rules. Those who preferred a dribbling version of the game set up the Football Association (FA) on 26 October 1863. Those who favoured a rugby-like version withdrew from the meeting and went on to form the Rugby Football Union in 1871. Football, as we know it today, became referred to as association football. The FA Cup, launched in 1871, is the oldest national football competition. Today, the rules of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board.
KICKING OFF EVERYWHERE
Football quickly found its place in rapidly industrialising Britain. Men from all social classes enjoyed it and played against one another. The football pitch became a legitimate venue for the working class to take a shot at the elite. Football had even begun to surpass the popularity of rugby. One of the reasons was that it was just as masculine but less rough than rugby. Young men simply could not afford to be absent from work due to injuries! Britons who travelled overseas, especially to parts of the British Empire, brought the game with them. As the popularity of football grew, particularly in Europe and South America, other countries began to set up their own football associations.
BIRTH OF THE WORLD CUP
In the early 1900s, some national football associations wanted to create an international body to discuss the future of football. They were interested in organising an international football competition. As a result, the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, was formed in 1904.

FOOTBALL IN SINGAPORE
In the late 19th century, the British in Singapore formed sporting clubs and regularly competed against one another. The first football match recorded on the island was played in 1889 by British engineers at a pitch in Tank Road. The game was subsequently introduced to British subjects and students in British schools, before it became a favourite sport among the locals.
A predecessor of the Football Association of Singapore, the Singapore Amateur Football Association (SAFA) was registered in 1892. Formed 29 years after the Football Association in England, it is possibly the oldest football association in Asia. The SAFA held the first Singapore Football League in 1904. The early football scene in Singapore was dominated by Europeans. But by the 1920s, local teams such as the Singapore Chinese Football Association and the Singapore Malays Football Association began to make their mark. They often competed with overseas teams to packed stadiums. Once, the best players from both associations literally brought the house down when they beat Australia 4-2 at Anson Road Stadium.

""Singapore's passion for football never waned, even when the threat of war loomed. In 1941, the island's team beat Penang to clinch the Malaysia Cup for the fourteenth time. The Malaysia Cup was one of the most anticipated football competitions in Singapore. It was started in 1921 as the Malaya Cup by officers of the British battleship, HMS Malaya. Many Singaporeans still remember the days when the whole nation would put aside whatever it was doing to cheer for the national team, fondly called â€˜the Lions'.""

However, 1994 was the last year Singapore won the Malaysia Cup. In 1995, Singapore's football administrators withdrew from the tournament to focus on developing its own league. This did not sit well with local fans. Nevertheless, the S.League was born in 1996. As of 2010, 12 teams, featuring a mix of local and foreign talents, vie for the S.League title.

The football superstar has ventured where no Singaporean has gone - in 1982, he was offered a place at Ajax Amsterdam, the club of the legendary winger Johan Cruyff. He signed on with Dutch club FC Groningen from 1983-1985 and has also played with Indonesia's Niac Mitra and the Kuala Lumpur Football Association, helping the team win the Malaysian Cup three years in a row from 1987-1989.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city,"After Sir Stamford Raffles set up Singapore as a port, it quickly became a hotspot in the region. Trade took place in massive volumes, trade houses were built, and the culture of various communities started to take root here.
The increase in trade saw Singapore's population grow more than ten-fold in just three years, exceeding the 10,000 mark by 1822. The migrant population had origins across Europe, China, South Asia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This surge in numbers, along with the mix of cultures on the island, led to land being used unsystematically, which strained the availability of space on the island.
Singapore's changing landscape
The Padang was a designated government area, but had houses and godowns erected on it because the Europeans and the Asian merchants preferred to set up their homes by the banks of the Singapore River. The colony, in short, was becoming disorderly and drastically different from Raffles' original vision for the island.
This is a view of the Telok Ayer Bay (mid-late 19th century), an area set aside by Stamford Raffles for the Chinese community in 1822. In this photograph, two iconic structures could be seen in the distanceâ€” the old Telok Ayer market by the sea and the Thian Hock Keng temple to the left. The temple, which still stands today, was built by early Chinese immigrants in gratitude to the deity Mazu for their safe passage across the seas. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
Raffles was dissatisfied with Farquhar's leadership and immediately set into motion plans to clean up the colony. In 1822, Raffles formed a Town Committee with the help of the colony's engineer and land surveyor, Lieutenant Philip Jackson, to tackle the situation. From his personal observations of other colonial towns, such as Georgetown in Penang, he knew that a formal town plan had led to the successfully integration of Indian and Chinese immigrants. This was the solution he settled on, as it prevented groups from developing separately and creating haphazard settlements.
The Jackson Plan
The Raffles Town Plan (1822), drawn up by Sir Stamford Raffles and Lieutenant P. Jackson, together with a Town Planning Committee was aimed at curbing disorderly growth of the settlement.Using the Singapore River as a natural boundary, functional and ethnic zones were marked out. The North Bank was reserved for government use, the South Bank for finance and commercial use.The Plan also included clear instructions on the layout and design of new buildings, shophouses and streets, for example the five-foot walkways and right-angled junctions. (Image from National Archives of Singapore.)
The town plan, titled â€œPlan of the Town of Singaporeâ€, also known as the Jackson Plan, was published in 1828. It focused on the development of the area around the Singapore River, from Telok Ayer to the Kallang River.
Adopting features from colonial urban planning in British India, Raffles set up the seat of government in Fort Canning, similar to Calcutta's fort-based layout. Raffles introduced ample greenery in the form of the Padang and the Botanic Gardens to give the impression of prosperity. It was also perhaps Singapore's first step as a â€œGarden Cityâ€.
Despite the failure of nutmegs at Orchard Road, there was still much interest in horticulture amongst wealthier residents in Singapore. This led to the formation of another Agri-Horticultural Society in 1859. The society's members wanted to establish a botanical garden where they could enjoy flowers and other plants in a pleasant landscape. One founding member of the society was the prominent merchant Hoo Ah Kay, also known as Whampoa, who helped to secure a location for a botanical garden at Tanglin. This garden would later develop into the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
Guided by pragmatism, Raffles also introduced a variety of features through the town plan which are still visible on the Singaporean landscape today. He moved Telok Ayer Market to where it is today so that it would be in the centre of the commercial district. Meanwhile, burial grounds were pushed much further inland. He mandated continuous sheltered walkways â€“ also known as five-foot ways â€“ meant to protect pedestrians from the hot tropical sun and rain. He also ensured that buildings were constructed with masonry and roof tiles, to reduce fire outbreaks for accessibility and safety.
But perhaps his most impactful mandate was the push for uniform and regular streets. He was so precise that he called for right angle intersections, indicated a minimum width for pavements and a minimum spacing in between buildings. This gave Singapore its almost grid-like layout in the heart of the city today, as evidenced by the Jubilee Trail.
Impressive features and construction works aside, the plan was ultimately created to facilitate trading and promote communal harmony.
Every community would have a space to call its own.
The city was split according to residential, commercial or civic usage. There was also further segregation based on people's provinces and the type of residency among citizens and merchants.
Land segregated for different communities
The Government was allocated the area stretching from Fort Canning to the Singapore River. The sea beyond the Padang (labelled â€œOpen Squareâ€ on the Jackson Plan) was also reserved for Government use. However, some places like the Old Parliament House had to be acquired by the government as it was originally built as a private home, and some other European merchants had already built houses within this area.
This stretch of Bussorah Street near Masjid Sultan was once known as Kampong Kaji (Pilgrim Village), kaji being the Javanese pronunciation of haji (pilgrim) as there were many Javanese living here. Until the mid-1970s, Singapore was the pilgrim hub in Southeast Asia, and pilgrims from nearby countries â€“ in particular, Indonesia due to Dutch restrictions on the pilgrimage â€“ would come to Singapore and stay at Bussorah Street while waiting for the kapal haj (pilgrim ship).
The seafront east of the cantonment to the southwest bank of the Singapore River was largely reserved for Europeans. Its actual occupants were European traders, Eurasians and rich Asians. There were also spaces for merchants in the area. When combined with the south bank of the Singapore River, reserved for commercial use, this area makes up the modern day Downtown Core.
And as its name suggests, Chinese Campong (present-day Chinatown) was reserved for the Chinese, and they were allocated a large area southwest of the Singapore River. This was where Chinese laborers of different professions, such as samsui women, Chinese letter writers and wood carvers would reside.
Indians were allocated land further up north from the Chinese in a place called Chulia Campong, but they would find themselves moving to another point north of the river. It was at this spot where a booming cattle trade saw cattle pulling bullock carts across the streets. This is Little India today.
The postcard depicts the junction of Chulia Street and the northwest corner of Raffles Place which was dominated for many years by the Bonham Building on the right. Chulia Street was originally known as Kling Street as large numbers of Indians from Southern India known as 'men from Kalinga' or 'orang kling' in Malay had congregated in the area. It was renamed Chulia Street as the term 'kling' adopted a deragotary association when Indian convicts were transported to Singapore. Chulia is the North Indian term for the Kalinga kingdom. c. Early 1900s. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
For the Malays, the plan focused on the area around the Sultan's residence for Bugis and Arab migrants. The area was, and is still, known as Kampong Glam, and its development resulted in the creation of three distinct parts - an area for the Sultan, one for the Bugis settlers and another for the Arab merchants.
Sense of community
The legacy of the Jackson Plan can still be seen on our maps today through the representation of the different ethnicities and ethnic quarters of the island, in areas such as Chinatown and Little India. Singapore is no longer divided by ethnic enclaves. What we have today is the organic mixing of communities, by the people who decided to make Singapore their home.
But the Jackson Plan still represents the essence of Singapore â€“ a cosmopolitan port city where people of different communities, ethnicities and religions come together to live, work and seek opportunities for a better life.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/cinemas-over-the-years/story,"TL;DR
Going to the cinema today is a state-of-the-art audiovisual experience, complete with spacious, comfy seats, and a buffet of snacks for us to choose from. But it wasn't always like this. No one in Singapore knew what a cinema was until 1902, when Basrai, a Parsi showman, set up the first outdoor film screening tent on a field along River Valley Road.
The gypsy cinema arrives in Singapore
Basrai was a travelling showman of the Parsi origins. In 1902, he arrived in Singapore with a tent that would change the country's entertainment scene forever. Set up at the junction of Hill Street and River Valley Road, his cinema was the first ever to screen a public film here. The entrance fee was 10 to 50 cents, and films were projected onto the screen using limelight.
The first films shown included Miroir deCagliostro (Cagliostro's Mirror), Le reve d'unastronome (Astronomer'sDream), and Photographing a Ghost. Although the visual effects and cinematography was vastly different by today's standards, the tent cinema was a huge hit for the two years following Basrai's arrival.
Singapore's first enclosed cinema
In 1904, the tent cinema saw a new rival on the scene. The Paris Cinematograph, started by French entrepreneur Paul Picard, was Singapore's first enclosed cinema in the Malay Theatre at Victoria Street. He screened hour-long pictures and played music to accompany the silent films. Back then, a third-class seat costed 10 cents and a reserved seat was 50 cents.
Our next big starâ€¦ Sound!
It wasn't until the 1920s that the first-ever â€˜talkies' (films with sound) arrived in Singapore. Naturally, it took Singapore by storm, and amusement park cinemas started showing popular American, British, Chinese, and Hindi films, which captivated huge audiences. This era gave birth to the Oriental Theatre at New Bridge Road and Majestic Theatre at Eu Tong Sen Street. Today, you can still find the preserved facade of the Majestic Theatre, right next to Chinatown MRT Station.
The cinema craze did not die out even when the Second World War arrived on our shores. As Singapore ushered in the 50s, even more players came into the picture. In 1952, Cathay Cinema became one of the first to screen a full-length 3D movie, Bwana Devil. The devil that popped out from the screens took every moviegoer's breath away.
If you have watched a movie at one of the older cinemas, you'd have probably noticed that the screen also came with a significantly spacious stage. Cinemas during those days were also equipped for live shows such as musicals, magic shows, beauty contests, variety shows, and dance performances.
In the 1970s, Asia's largest drive-in cinema that could accommodate 900 vehicles also opened in Jurong. c. 1971. Image courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.
Capitol Cinema was Shaw Organisation's flagship cinema after they purchased the Capitol building (later renamed Shaws Building) from the Namazie brothers in 1946. The tenancy of the building was returned to Singapore government in 1980s. c.1950s. Image courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.
Running the show until today
The industry's boom led to many bigger players in the world of cinema to establish their presence in Singapore. Some of these have survived the changing eras, and film buffs today continue to enjoy big-screen entertainment at one of their cineplexes. Here are some you might already know:
View of Shaw House (right) and Lido Cinema from Orchard Road, Singapore. c.1969. Image courtesy of the National Archives of Singapore.
Shaw Brothers, a film group set up by brothers Run Run and Run Me Shaw, owned more than 100 cinemas in Southeast Asia and had the biggest cinema empire in Singapore in 1965. Their 19 cinema halls were located across the island, and another 30 cinemas licensed to play the movies they exclusively distributed. They also opened REX cinema at Mackenzie Road, a popular spot for foreign workers.

Cathay Organisation's founder, Loke Wan Tho, hailed from one of the wealthiest families in Malaya, and instead of carrying on the family business, he decided to produce movies and own cinema chains, a wise decision that brought the organisation its continued success until today.
Eng Wah, also a Malayan native, set up a cinema at the Happy World Amusement Park with a friend. It was renamed Victory Theatre and survived the war by screening Japanese propaganda films. He continued his expansion to more cinemas and set up Eng Wah Theatres in 1968, bringing in numerous Chinese movies from Hong Kong and Taiwan. It has since rebranded itself as WE Cinemas.
Golden Village is a relatively new player. A joint venture by Golden Harvest (Hong Kong) and Village Roadshow (Australia), it began operating in the early 90s and now owns 11 multiplexes and cineplexes in the country.
Filmgarde Cineplex is the latest addition in the line of high rollers. Established in 2007, this independent cinema offers films of other genres aside from the blockbusters, with the aim of cultivating a community of film lovers in Singapore.

Cinema now, and beyond
Over a century has passed since the tented cinema debuted with its first screening in Singapore. The cinemas today not only face fierce competition from one another, the films they show must also outshine the huge selections from online streaming services.

That's why independent venues such as The Projector, The Arts House, Alliance Francaise Cine Club, The Screening Room, The Substation, and Moving Image Gallery at SAM @ 8Q, offer unique genres of carefully curated films that are otherwise less accessible to the mainstream moviegoer.
From tented cinema to today's indie art house theatres, the journey of Singapore's big screens will continue to grow and evolve. What's going to happen to our cinemas in the future? Let's watch on.

Made popular in Shanghai in the 1920s, the ubiquitous cheongsam no longer invokes an image of an older generation in a bygone era who wore it for practical and functional reasons. Through the years, the cheongsam has evolved together with social, economic and political landscapes. It is now donned throughout the world, from silver screen sirens and female political figures to women from all walks of life.
In a fitting tribute to this iconic dress and how its evolution parallels the changing social roles of Singaporean women, over 150 pieces of cheongsam were put on display at the National Museum of Singapore from 28 March to 27 June 2012. Titled In the Mood for Cheongsam: Modernity and Singapore Women, the exhibition examined the rise of the modified cheongsam in modern Shanghai, its evolution, its introduction in Singapore during the 1920s and fascinating stories of iconic Singapore women who made the cheongsam their outfit of choice through the decades. These women include the wives of Singapore's former political leaders such as the late Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, the late Mrs Benjamin Sheares, the late Mrs Wee Kim Wee and influential female icons such as Mrs Elizabeth Choy, Datin Aw Cheng Hu and Mrs Christina Loke. The exhibition also featured the late legendary Hong Kong actress Lin Dai's personal cheongsam collection.
Capped sleeves embroidered cheongsam with rose motif Sequins, beads, 1960s, Hong Kong Image: On loan from Hong Kong Film Archives, Leisure and Cultural Services Department.
The exhibition was categories into six sections: (1) The Origins of the Modern Cheongsam, 1920s; (2) The Cheongsam in Singapore, 1920 to 1940s; (3) The Golden Period of Cheongsam in Singapore, 1950s to 1960s; (4) Personal Wardrobes; (5) The Power Cheongsam; and (6) Modern Interpretation of Cheongsam.
THE ORIGINS OF THE MODERN CHEONGSAM, 1920s presented the modernised cheongsam as worn by the educated elite. The style in the 1920s signified a period of liberation, with the burgeoning of new ideas and thoughts on the role of women. The cheongsam of the 1920s was loose; the sleeves were wide; and the overall look, simple.
The collar, sleeves, front flap and edges of this garment are embellished with machine-made trimmings, which help to accentuate the form. As the bolt is not wide enough, two pieces of fabric were joined at the centre to make this garment. The tailor had to skilfully match the patterns on both pieces of fabric to ensure that the design is symmetrical. This outfit has no slit on the left side and a press stud at the bottom can be seen if it is opened fully.

This is an example of a late 1920s cheongsam with long and narrow sleeves made of silk damask with cloud motifs. One side of the cheongsam is secured by simple knotted buttons. Its loose silhouette is similar to the changshan, the long robe worn by men. This cheongsam is one of the oldest pieces in the National Museum of Singapore's collection.

THE CHEONGSAM IN SINGAPORE, 1920 TO 1940s saw a stronger sense of modernisation and the embrace of western fashion concepts such as narrower and shorter sleeves, the use of imported fabrics such as silk crepe, georgette and chiffon, as well as the use of geometric, floral and Art Deco motifs.
In Singapore, the cheongsam, which was associated with modernity, was a popular garb for teachers, wives of wealthy businessmen, young girls, and the Peranakans.
This is a typical example of a 1930s cheongsam, made of fabric printed with geometric patterns from the Art Deco period. The use of such fabrics was extremely popular in Shanghai during the 1930s and reflected the rising influence of Western trends in the cheongsam. The sleeves and body of the cheongsam were made from one piece of fabric. The cut is relatively slender and narrow at the waist compared to the loose-cut cheongsam of the 1920s. The sleeves are not only shorter but also narrower, suggesting the effort to highlight the curves of the female form. There is a slit on the left side, and a full opening on the right. The collar, cuffs, front flap and hem are adorned with piping and binding that complement the colour of the fabric. Blue and white knotted buttons embellish the high collar.

This 1930s cheongsam, made of imported silk crÃªpe with floral embroidery, was worn by a bride on her wedding day. As the cheongsam is translucent; it is paired with a slip of scalloped edging underneath. The use of lightweight, imported fabrics for cheongsam in Shanghai and Singapore showed a shift in the nature of the garment from traditional to cosmopolitan.

THE GOLDEN PERIOD OF CHEONGSAM IN SINGAPORE, 1950s TO 1960s represented the evolution of the cheongsam to a popular everyday wear for working women, showing a significant shift in the identity of women from the traditional home-maker to the modern working female due to the country's changing political, economic and social climate after World War Two.
This cheongsam collection features a nipped-in waist which became popular in the West after the Second World War. Darts on the bust and waist of the cheongsam help to take in excess fabric and accentuate the figure of the wearer.

Christine certainly learnt that lesson well. Her vast knowledge was undeniable as she effortlessly peppered her National Museum of Singapore tour with precise dates and details from start to finish. Her fascination with the rich and colourful personalities of historical characters has clearly not waned.
â€œDid you know, David Marshall only wrote with a green pen?â€ she asks a group. This is just one of many fun facts Christine has at her fingertips, keeping visitors engaged with rich and vivid details that they would never have been able to glean from reading the museum labels.
Vivid scenes and stories
Whether it was Raffles, Farquhar, rickshaw pullers or Chettiars, Christine paints such vivid and compelling pictures of their lives that visitors feel, for a moment, they are in those people's shoes.
Sitting in a mock-up of a typical living room belonging to a Chettiar from Tamil Nadu decades ago, Christine describes the minute details of his everyday life. She walks visitors through everything â€“â€“ the tools he used, how he might have sat at his workstation, how to decode the scribbles in his journal.
A charming raconteur, Christine shares stories of Singapore's history as if they were her own. She has been a docent for 20 years, frequently holding tours not only at the National Museum, but also the National Gallery, Peranakan Museum, and more.
Christine's years of experience and close relationship with the National Museum â€“â€“ her very first museum â€“â€“ allows her to tell wonderful personal anecdotes about it.
For example, the National Museum houses a beautiful gold armlet from the 14th century which bears a plaque of repoussÃ© work depicting the Javanese kala. The kala motif is a protective symbol, found at the entrance of Javanese temples dating from the 8th to 14th centuries. Christine shares that during a major renovation, the armlet was kept in a temporary display location where a fire broke out. Rumour had it that the sacred kala was not happy to have been moved to the temporary display! Thankfully, there have been no further calamities since it found its permanent exhibit in the newly refurbished National Museum.
Moving through a section on William Farquhar, Christine teaches the correct pronunciation of â€œFarquharâ€ â€“â€“ â€œfah-kerâ€. This came as a surprise to many in the tour group, who had been saying it wrongly all these years. Christine herself had only learnt how to pronounce it accurately at the National Museum.
Still as exciting
The training docents have to undergo is very rigorous, requiring a high level of commitment. â€œBut it's all worth itâ€, she shared. â€œIt's very rewarding.â€
For Christine, two decades of giving history tours has not dulled her experience one bit. Each tour she conducts continually informs and enriches the next, and even across different museums.
â€œIt's never the same tour, twice,â€ explained Christine. Fresh information she learns at a new Asian Civilisations Museum exhibition, for example, equips her with new stories to tell on her tours at other museums. Furthermore, she takes care to tailor each of her tours to the demographic of her group. Attendees are so varied â€“â€“ tourists, elderly, young children, secondary school students, the list goes on. Christine always tries her best to focus on details and fun facts that her listeners might identify with and find interesting.
Asked if her friends and family share her enthusiasm for history or volunteering, Christine laughs and says, â€œMost of them think I'm weird, putting in so much work for free!â€ But, the friendships Christine has forged with fellow docents is priceless because that brings her happiness and fulfillment, day in and day out. Many of Christine's co-volunteers have become travel buddies and lifelong friends, and she is very grateful to have found fellow enthusiasts who share her passions. â€œWe're history nerds together,â€ she chuckles. â€œWe never run out of things to talk about.â€

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 2 â€“ Apr to Jun 2011
A recent edition of BeMUSE1 featured a painting by Pu Ru æº¥å„’ (1896-1963) titled A Copy of the â€œBeauties on an Outingâ€ by Li Gonglin from the Asian Civilisations Museum collection (Fig.1).
Fig. 1. Pu Ru (1896-1963), A Copy of the ""Beauties on an Outing"" by Li Gonglin, Undated, 37 x 718.5cm. Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum. Gift of the Tan family in memory of their late father, Dr Tan Tsze Chor.
Apart from its intrinsic beauty, the work epitomises a key feature of Chinese painting, which is a reverence for the past through the act of copying. As its title suggests, the painting is based on a work attributed to an earlier artist, Li Gonglin æŽå…¬éºŸ (1049-1106), from the Song dynasty.2 Li's work is also similar in composition and style to another painting, possibly done by the Song emperor Huizong å¾½å®— (r. 1100-1126) who had in turn copied a now-lost work of Tang dynasty artist Zhang Xuan å¼ è± (713-755)!3
A colophon was later added to Pu's painting by scholar Rao Zongyi who pointed out that Pu was mistaken in thinking that the subject he chose was of a concubine leaving the court. According to Rao, the depicted scene is actually Lady Guoguo's Spring Outing. The original painting by Li Gonglin is in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and can be used for verification (Fig. 1a).

The Tradition of Copying
Copying is a common method of art training in many cultures. This is especially so for the ancient tradition of Chinese painting also known as maobi hua æ¯›ç¬”ç”» or shuimo hua æ°´å¢¨ç”». The tools used for such paintings (ink and colour pigments applied with a brush on paper or silk) have remained largely unchanged over 3,000 years.
In China, copying is a commonly accepted means of learning painting and calligraphy. As early as the sixth century, Xie He è°¢èµ« had mentioned the copying of old masterpieces as one of the Six Laws or Principles of Chinese painting aesthetics.4 Closer to our time, there is a well-known episode in the 1940s when Zhang Daqian and Xie Zhiliu spent nearly a year to document the Dunhuang cave murals in Gansu province by painting life-size reproductions. Interestingly, the murals themselves were also the result of copying in ancient times. The paintings' outlines were initially produced through stencils. Relying on these stencilled outlines, Dunhuang artists then painted the final images directly on the walls. Zhang Daqian's remarkable copying skills have given rise to a number of enduring controversies. One of the most prominent is the case of The Riverbank â€“ a painting attributed to the 10th century master Dong Yuan by its owner, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, but which some recent scholars have suggested is a modern fake by Zhang.5
In Chinese painting, a beginner usually learns by copying his teachers' brushwork and composition, and from studying extant masterpieces, reproductions and instruction manuals. Once he has attained a sound foundation, he is then expected to develop a personal language that is a synthesis or reinterpretation of past styles, and one that reflects his personality, temperament and character. This is not to say that Chinese artists do not observe nature or are inept in capturing physical likeness. For them, studying nature is a key ingredient in art, but copying is a proven method of studying how earlier artists translated the physical form and, more importantly, the spirit of the three-dimensional world onto the two-dimensional surface of a painting. Moreover, in an era when mechanical reproduction was not yet available, making hand-painted copies was the only way of circulating widely admired works amongst artists and collectors. For instance, Su Shih è‹è½¼ of the Song dynasty was known to have lent old paintings to friends who wanted to have copies made.6 Sometimes, artists even created copies as a joke or to test their friends' knowledge. And in a society where much respect is accorded to seniority and ancestry, artists have long been regarded as custodians and transmitters of culture and tradition. Hence, creating a work that refers to the past, especially the styles of great masters, signals an artist's intent to be included as part of an illustrious lineage. In this way, making copies of paintings is seen as an exercise in virtuosity by artists who revere history. Pu's painting, with its declared connections to antiquity, is a clear example of such aspirations.
Generally, there are three ways to make copies. The first is to make an exact copy by tracing an existing work (known as mo æ‘¹). This ensures that the entire composition and scale are reproduced very closely. However, because tracing has to be done slowly, the final brushwork may lack fluidity and a sense of spontaneity. The other way is to make a freehand copy by studying the original closely (known as lin ä¸´). In this more technically demanding method, the artist has more freedom in his brushwork, but an exact copy is virtually impossible. The third category of â€˜copy' paintings refers to works done in the style of a particular artist but not based on any specific painting. For such works (sometimes known as imaginary copies), an artist creates a new composition in the style of another. In the hands of a skilful artist, it is possible to get a good copy very close to the style of the master with confident free-flowing brushwork. Two paintings in the Asian Civilisations Museum collection, Landscape in the style of Huang Gongwang by Wang Yuanqi çŽ‹åŽŸç¥ and Ink Plum Blossoms done in the style of Wang Mian by Qian Du é’±æœ, are good examples of such imaginary copies.

The Problem of Copies
The general acceptance and proliferation of copies in Chinese art have made it conducive for unscrupulous dealers and artists to pass off copies as originals. Some Chinese connoisseurs consider it impolite or inelegant to expose the works of forgers; as a result, certain fraudulent works continue to be circulated in the market.7 For instance, artist and connoisseur Xiao Ping (b. 1942) was once asked by a friend to write a colophon on a painting of chrysanthemums by Fu Baoshi (1904-1965) which he felt was a fake. However, as the collector was a senior official whom he did not wish to offend, Xiao penned a colophon based on a poem of chrysanthemums by Fu, without mentioning the quality of the painting. He had hoped that whoever read his colophon in the future would be able to read between the lines and understand that he had declined to give an opinion on the authenticity of the painting.8
Therefore, given the presence of an active art market, the existence of forgeries in China, as in other countries, is unsurprising. However, the circulation of copies is not only a problem for unwary collectors. It also poses challenges for curators and art historians who have to ascertain the authenticity of works in order to construct an accurate history of an artist's practice and in the process, establish a better understanding of Chinese art history.
General Principles Of Authentication
Generally, the task of authenticating involves close examination of two main aspects of a painting â€“ dating and authorship. Firstly, one has to determine if the work comes from the period of its purported date. If undated, then the work should have been produced sometime during the artist's lifetime. This involves technical analysis to assess the age of the materials used in the painting. Advances in scientific analysis have made the results of such tests generally objective and incontrovertible. However, for authenticating recent paintings, especially those by 19th and 20th century artists, such tests are less helpful as forgers usually have little difficulty in obtaining raw materials which are still relatively plentiful today. Moreover, in a heated art market where demand for paintings exceeds supply, it is not inconceivable for copies of a famous artist's works to be produced and sold even during his lifetime, which makes it even more difficult to authenticate a work based on its age.
That said, the correct age does not necessarily mean that the painting is authentic. After the age of the materials has been verified, the next task is to determine if the artist is the author of the painting. An authenticator's conclusions are drawn after looking closely at the painting and comparing it with authentic works. This requires the authenticator to have an intimate understanding of the artist's practice, down to details like the artist's favoured type of paper to the places he travelled to and the people he met during his lifetime. It also requires a sufficiently large number of reliably authentic works for comparison. This can be a problem with very old works as few original works prior to the Song dynasty have survived. Sometimes, an artist may produce two genuine works with the same subject matter but of different quality. This poses difficulties later on as authenticators will have to decide which of the two genuine works to use for comparison purposes. Similarly, forgers may sometimes forge the works of artists whose paintings are long-lost, hoping that such works could never be verified against authentic extant ones.9
Ambiguous Cases
However, the question of what comes from the artist's own hand is made murkier by paintings copied with the knowledge or authority of the artist. This has happened when the artist could not cope with high demand for his paintings and had to rely on students or relatives who could make relatively faithful copies to supply the needed works.10 The artist would complete the copy by writing the accompanying inscription and signature, with perhaps a few additional brushstrokes here and there to â€˜improve' the painting.11
Equally controversial is the practice of separating a painting into two. Chinese paintings are usually done on paper made from multiple layers of pulp. For a sufficiently thick painting, a skilful mounter can divide the work into two by carefully separating the paper layers to produce two thinner sheets. This results in two identical paintings. Both layers bear the same image since the ink would have penetrated both layers during the painting process. The only slight difference is that the image on the top layer tends to be sharper and have richer tones than the one on the bottom.12 However, it could be argued that both paintings remain authentic as they came from the artist's hands and no third party was involved in the painting process.
To complicate matters further, there are recorded instances when a famous artist such as Dong Qichang è‘£å…¶æ˜Œ (1555-1636), whose works were very much in demand, sometimes even permitted his friends to use his name on their own works.13 Another similar episode recounts how an impoverished senior artist, too embarrassed to ask Zhang Daqian for a painting, once invited Zhang to paint a joint work, which the latter agreed. Zhang first painted the figures and the senior artist later added the landscape elements. For such a collaborative work, both artists would usually sign the painting. However, in this case, the senior artist did not sign and instead asked Zhang to write the inscription. Sympathetic to the senior artist's plight, Zhang complied with the request, even though he realised that the work could eventually be passed off as a painting done entirely by Zhang, and hence command a higher price as compared to a collaborative work.14
Specific Methods of Authentication
1. The Materials Of The Painting
As mentioned, the first task is to determine if a work comes from the period that it purports to date from. If undated, then the painting should have been produced sometime during the artist's lifetime. A visual inspection is not sufficient as there are ways to create an aged or faded effect on new materials. For very old paintings, it is possible to send the paper or silk on which the painting is done, or the silk on which the painting is mounted, for scientific analysis. These tests usually provide a broad time period within which the paper or silk was made. Hence, they are more useful for authenticating older paintings rather than recent works. However, it should be noted that it is always possible for a resourceful forger to obtain old paper, silk and even ink sticks to make ink, and use them to create forgeries. This could extend to pulping blank pages from an old book to produce a piece of â€˜old' paper!15 Hence, even for genuinely old paintings, it is still necessary to determine if the painting was likely to have been painted by the artist.
For more recent works where the age of materials is not a useful guide of authenticity, an authenticator should be familiar with the types of paper, ink, seal paste and scroll mounting that the artist prefers or usually works with. Hence, a painting done on paper of a certain type would be suspect if the artist is not known to use that particular paper. However, such tests are never definitive. One can imagine a few possible scenarios where such anomalies may occur. For instance, the artist might have bought some new paper to try on but gave up after a few attempts. If those preliminary works survived, they would be hard to place within the artist's overall output, especially if the artist did not mention these attempts to anyone.
2. Scrutinising The Subject Matter
Once it is ascertained that the materials used are of the type that the artist is likely to have used, the next step is to determine if the subject matter of the painting is typical of the artist for that particular period of his career. In this case, the subject matter refers to all the visual elements found on the painting surface: the images (be it a landscape, bird and flower or human figures), the calligraphic inscriptions and signatures, and the seals.
In terms of the imagery, the authenticator should ascertain whether the artist is known to have painted certain subjects during a particular period. For instance, an artist may be known for painting landscapes but not for human figures. Likewise, the authenticator should also examine the calligraphic inscriptions, signatures and seals to see if they are typical of the artist for the period in question. For instance, some artists may change their signature or the type of seals they use as they get older. Hence, a painting is likely to be a forgery if it bears a signature or seal that is chronologically inconsistent with the artist's known practice. A careful reading of the inscriptions may also be helpful in authentication. For example, a careless forger may write an inscription purporting that the painting was a gift for a famous patron, but mistakenly include a date beyond the lifetime of the said patron.
3. Question Of Style
Even if the subject matter is typical, the authenticator then needs to determine if the manner or style of painting and writing is typical of the artist and corresponds to his known style for that particular period. This would involve comparing the work in question with known authentic paintings of the same period. In analysing painting and writing styles, emphasis is paid on the brushwork, use of ink and colour, and overall composition. Brushwork can be expressed in many ways â€“ dry or wet, dense or sparse, thick or thin, light or heavy, broken or continuous, smooth or energetic, soft or angular â€“ the permutations are endless. Likewise, the use of ink and colour can be similarly varied from light to dark, sparse to heavy. Composition may also be highly individualistic, balanced or asymmetrical, static or dynamic and so on. In terms of writing, it is important to compare the spacing between columns and characters to ascertain if there is a pleasing rhythm in the flow of characters and a balanced, harmonious composition. Such stylistic analysis is based on the assumption that most artists, though their styles may change with time, usually paint and write in a certain way for a particular period.
4. Determining Quality
Once it has been determined that the subject matter and style are consistent with the artist's, the next aspect â€“ quality â€“ is the most difficult to ascertain. There is a common assumption that great artists always create good work, and a work of an ordinary or mediocre standard can never come from his hands. From a great artist, most would demand forceful brushwork, confident calligraphy, lively imagery, and a harmonious, if not striking composition. These are qualities that can reasonably be expected from works produced at the peak of his career. However, this necessarily also implies that works completed at an earlier age (when the artist's skills were not yet fully honed or he was in transition between styles) or in his later years (when his physical faculties or energies were faltering) will understandably exhibit fewer of these desirable attributes. Forgers sometimes forge works from these periods precisely because authentic works created during those periods do not bear the artist's mature style and will usually be accepted by collectors as being of secondary quality.16
In addition, a Chinese painting may be completed within a few hours, if not minutes. Hence, an artist could conceivably produce thousands of works in his lifetime. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect every single work to exhibit the same high standards. Inevitably, there will be works of a lower quality, perhaps produced when the artist was unwell, tired, uninspired or simply, socially obligated.
5. Tracking The Provenance
Lastly, after ascertaining that the age, subject, style and quality are consistent with the artist's works of that period, the authenticator can further verify the work's authenticity through its provenance, that is, the history of ownership of the work. This could be evident from the colophons â€“ additional inscriptions â€“ written by the painting's various owners, either on the painting itself or its silk mounting borders. This is an accepted practice where owners either impress their seals or write a short piece of text to signal their ownership and appreciation of the work. This could then be verified against painting inventories maintained by the same collectors, where available. Emperors like Huizong from the Song dynasty and Qianlong (r. 1735-1796) from the Qing dynasty were famous for their inventories and these have proven invaluable in authenticating many paintings. However, listings in such inventories alone are not very useful as these inventories were seldom illustrated. Moreover, many artists tended to paint similar subjects or give their paintings similar titles such as â€˜Fishing in the River' or â€˜Dwelling in the Mountains', thereby making verification through such listings problematic. In recent times, it has become possible to obtain some form of verification from recollections of direct witnesses. These could be students, family members, collectors or close friends of the artist who were present when the painting was completed. These same individuals, if reliable, could also provide valuable information to prove that the painting was unlikely to have been produced by the artist. This is especially if they are privy to information that is not publicly known such as the artist's likes or dislikes, or his habits when painting.
Difficulties of Authentication
It is important to always keep in mind that authentication remains a subjective test. Apart from an artist's direct testimony, all other evidence will be circumstantial, and the conclusion can never be definitive. In some instances, it is even possible to question an artist's testimony, especially if his memory is failing or there are special circumstances where he may want to hide the truth. For instance, a Singapore art collector recounted that when the famous painter Guan Shanyue é—œå±±æœˆ (1912-2000) visited Singapore in 1986, he was asked by many local collectors to authenticate works in their collections. When confronted with fakes, Guan would make light of the awkward situation by joking that â€œI have painted numerous paintings over the decades, but I don't seem to remember having done this particular one. In any case, this artist can probably do a better job than I can!â€17
After a thorough examination, the authenticator can, at most, opine that the painting is likely, very likely or unlikely to be the work of the artist. Even if the painting comes with a certificate of authenticity signed by the artist, there is no assurance that the work in question has not been replaced with a copy whilst in circulation. Generally, there are only a few instances when one can be reasonably certain that a work is genuine. They include works uncovered from archaeological sites, works obtained directly from the artist in his lifetime, and works donated by the artist to a public museum. In the latter case, it is then clear that the paintings did not have a chance to circulate in the open market where copies could be switched for originals.
Authentication requires very careful analysis and the application of any type of test will have to be done on a case-by-case basis. There are plenty of exceptions to the rule that have to be taken note of. For instance, when analysing a work based on an artist's subject type, it is helpful to know that an artist's subject preferences can change over time or he may favour several subjects concurrently. In addition, a landscape painter, pressured by a close friend or an important patron, may feel obliged to produce a portrait if faced with such a specific request. In such circumstances, it is understandable if the artist does not publicise the work's existence. Hence, the fact that such works are unknown does not conclusively prove that they are not authentic.
Likewise, it is inaccurate to assume that an artist only has one style of painting at any given period. A skilled artist could conceivably be proficient in several styles at the same time. For one occasion, he could paint a landscape in a spare style, done in pure ink with quick brushwork. For another occasion (or perhaps for a different patron), he could choose to depict the same landscape in a more decorative and elaborate style, full of colour and intricate detail. Sometimes, even stylistic analyses may not be very helpful. For instance, experts see little use in analysing Ming artist Qiu Ying's signature when authenticating his works as Qiu had felt that his calligraphy was inferior and often invited friends to sign his works for him.18
When analysing a painting's quality, it is important to keep in mind the possibility of authentic works of low quality. Although many artists would be loathe to sell or give away inferior works, sometimes low-quality but authentic works may still leak into the open market without their knowledge. For instance, it is known that Xu Beihong had a habit of practising painting and calligraphy every morning, and often discarded unsatisfactory works by throwing them aside. Unknown to Xu, some admirers retrieved some of these unsigned works as keepsakes which later surfaced in the open market with spurious signatures or seals added on.19 Strictly speaking, these works cannot be considered fakes. Therefore, it is useful to keep in mind that a mediocre work does not necessarily mean that it is not authentic.
Lastly, just as the skills of authenticators increase over time, so have the abilities of resourceful forgers. For example, forgers are aware of the value placed on colophons for authentication. Hence, they are known to remove true colophons from original paintings and pair them with forged paintings in an attempt to give the fakes a veneer of pedigree. Similarly, a forger could also pair a fake colophon purportedly by a famous name with an authentic painting by a lesser name, in order to elevate the value of the painting.20 Art historian James Cahill has highlighted that Zhang Daqian sometimes asked other artists, collectors and connoisseurs to write laudatory colophons for his copies so that they could be passed off as originals.21
The Value of Copies
However, at the end of the day, it should be noted that authentication is not just merely a case of comparison, trying to match and identify elements in order to expose a fake. The ability to authenticate a specific painting by an artist and place it in connection with the rest of his works contributes immeasurably to our understanding of the development of his practice. This, in turn, provides a more stable foundation on which to build a better understanding of Chinese art history. Lastly, it is important to keep in mind the advice of art historian Wang Yao-t'ing, who once highlighted that when confronted with a Ming copy of a Song painting, one could adopt two possible perspectives: it is a fake from the Song perspective but nevertheless, a genuine work from the Ming period.22 Hence, once the painting is returned to its proper context, there is still value in the work and much to be learnt from it.

For the better part of the past two millennia from the time of writing in 2012, India was a leading source of textiles for trade. Cotton cloth, along with a much smaller but highly valuable quantity of silk, was traded from production and distribution centres in Gujarat in northwest India and the Coromandel Coast in the southeast. Little known today, these textiles had a wide ranging and lasting impact on human civilisation in interesting and sometimes surprising ways. These textiles were the subject of the exhibition, Patterns of Trade: Indian Textiles for Export, 1400-1900, held at the Asian Civilisations Musuem until 3 June 2012.

Evidence from excavations in the Indus Valley dating back to about 4,500 years ago shows that Indians had already developed the technology to weave cotton into cloth at that time. Two thousand years ago, Indian artisans and traders had built on their knowledge, along with a parallel expertise in painting and dyeing cloth, to become the world's leader in textile production. They had held this position until the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.
India's advantage in textile production not only stemmed from its technological edge. The Indian subcontinent had a large population, which provided the workforce to perform the labour-intensive job of producing textiles. India also had ample land and a distinct dry season that made the region an ideal place to grow cotton. These advantages allowed Indian producers to manufacture a large surplus of cloth which it could trade to foreign markets.
Textile production and major trade centres in the Indian subcontinent, 1600-1900.
The bulk of India's textiles were cotton of modest quality â€“ plain colours or simple, repetitive patterns of checks, stripes or floral lattices. These textiles were sold in foreign marketplaces more cheaply than cloth could be produced locally. At the other end of the market, India's weavers and dyers were capable of producing cotton and silk textiles of exquisite quality and beauty.
The Indian textile industry was both productive and efficient. First, weavers living in or near cotton growing areas would process and weave the cotton into cloth. Next, the cloth would be graded; following which middlemen would purchase the cloth and send it to workshops for dyeing, printing and painting. Dyers had to be located near adequate sources of clean water to ensure the quality of the bright and colourfast dyes which India was famous for. After dyeing, the agents would sell the cloth to merchants heading to foreign ports. India's traders had developed a sophisticated understanding of the markets they served, providing feedback to producers on the types and qualities of cloth that were most in demand. These merchants, often settled and had families in their host markets, knew the tastes of their customers and were able to relay information to the agents about what colours, designs, formats and levels of quality were most desirable. At the height of the Indian textile trade, merchants even brought back local designs and motifs which the painters and dyers faithfully copied.

The earliest evidence we have on foreign trade of Indian textiles is in the Roman account of the first century. The Romans called Indian cotton â€œwoven airâ€, in praise of its lightness and quality. These accounts described Indian cloth as a luxury good; however, the quantities were sufficient for Pliny the Elder to complain in 77 CE (Common Era) that Roman coffers were being emptied into India. Historical records from about the same period also mention Indian cotton being sent as gifts to the Emperor of China. The oldest examples of Indian cloth are fragments found at archaeological sites in Egypt, along the coast of the Red Sea at Berenike (old Bernice), and date to the fifth century. More fragments, which date from the ninth century, were excavated at Quesir Al Qadim and Fustat (Old Cairo).
The fragments found in Egypt are proof that trade in Indian cloth continued to flow even after Rome's gradual decline. The Islamic world also embraced Indian textiles after its rise in the seventh century, and the new religion spread to both South and Southeast Asia along the same routes on which Indian textiles were traded. By the end of the 15th century, this robust and complex network had spread throughout the Indian Ocean basin and from the western coast of Africa to China.
When the Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511, the Portuguese chronicler TomÃ© Pires estimated that the annual value of Malacca's textile trade was worth 460,000 cruzados, the equivalent of almost 20 tonnes of silver. At that time, Malacca was one of the world's richest cities, and Southeast Asia had grown to be a crucial market for Indian trade cloth. Island Southeast Asia was also the source of some of the world's rarest and most desirable spices and aromatics, as well as other valuable commodities. Aside from the fragments found in Egypt, the earliest Indian trade textiles which survive today were found in the eastern half of the Indonesian Archipelago. These came from the remote islands of Maluku, as well as Timor and especially from the Toraja Highlands of Sulawesi. Some of these textiles have radiocarbon dates which range into the late 13th century.
Maluku, a tiny cluster of islands in the far Eastern Archipelago, was for much of history the world's only source of nutmeg, mace and cloves. These so-called â€œfine spicesâ€ were used to preserve and flavour food as well as for their perceived medicinal powers. For centuries, these spices were literally worth their weight in gold in the West. Not surprisingly, traders flocked to the islands, bringing with them Indian cloth which were highly prized by the islanders.
While Maluku was more important economically during the time of the spice trade, it is Toraja which is the source of most of the earliest trade textiles that have been found. The Toraja called these textiles ma'a or mawa and believed that they served as a sacred bridge to the afterlife. Ma'a were used in funerals and other rituals and allowed the Toraja to interact and communicate with their ancestors. After the Dutch took control of the coastal ports of Sulawesi, the Toraja became isolated from the outside world and could no longer replace their Indian cloth. Instead they had to carefully preserve these textiles for generations, whereas in most other areas the cloths eventually disintegrated, were lost or replaced.
Early inscriptions found at archaeological sites clearly indicate that Indian cloth had been traded into Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Java in as early as the ninth century. The earliest and finest pieces discovered in this area, however, date from the 17th and 18th centuries. These were found in the remote interior areas of kampung and Jambi in southern Sumatra, and almost all originated from the Coromandel Coast.
Skirt cloth (kain leluhur): patchwork centerfield Coromandel Coast, 17th or 18th century, 223x422cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.
The reasons for this are complex. For one, the pepper boom of the 17th century had significantly increased the flow of cloth into the region during this period. More importantly, large amounts of top quality cloth were brought in by traders as gifts to local rulers. These found their way into the interior of Sumatra where they came to be valued as a form of currency which could be accumulated as wealth. These cloths eventually became heirlooms and were used in social rituals such as wedding exchanges. While the practice of storing these textiles as wealth was eventually abandoned by the more cosmopolitan trading centres of the coast, the people of Lampung carefully stored their early trade textiles until the 1970s and 1980s, when they began to re-emerge in the antiques market.
Large skirt cloth (kain dodot): floral lattice Coromandel Coast, late 18th century, 230x309cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.
In the 17th century, the European East India Companies began shipping Indian cloth home along with cargoes of spices and Chinese porcelain. The cloth quickly became a sensation. Compared to the drab woollens and linens the Europeans were used to, the Indian cloth's beauty, quality and affordability made them hugely popular in Europe. European textile producers at first were unable to compete, which in turn threatened the livelihoods of tens of thousands of local textile workers. Even high taxes and import restrictions could not halt the flood of Indian cloth into Europe.
Beginning from the 18th century, innovators in Europe began to seek out the secrets of Indian textile production and started to develop ways to manufacture cloth more cheaply and efficiently. Mechanical innovations provided the key. Over the course of the century, new machines led to an explosion in productivity, which helped spark the Industrial Revolution.
By the mid-19th century, Europe was exporting more cloth to India than it imported. This cloth was cheaper and of better overall quality. European producers also captured much of India's market share in other Asian and African markets. This had a disastrous impact on India's textile industry, wiping out almost all of India's indigenous textile production.
Indian trade textiles had a lasting influence on the development of textile designs. While the new machine-made cloths were less expensive and more consistent in quality, they continued to draw on the design legacy of their Indian predecessors. The bright floral prints and dense styles of the 19th and early-20th centuries were direct descendants of Indian chintzes traded to Europe hundreds of years before.
Nowhere else perhaps is the influence of Indian trade textiles more noticeable than in island Southeast Asia, where many of the indigenous textile traditions were profoundly shaped by their long and nearly continuous interaction with Indian cloth. Indigenous communities around the archipelago actively incorporated the designs and motifs of Indian cloths into their own textiles. As the 18th century progressed and Indian textiles became more expensive, textiles made in Indonesia began to replace Indian cloths. Inexpensive and high quality machine-made plain white cotton from the Netherlands provided the raw materials for a boom in batik production in Java, which the Dutch colonial government actively encouraged.
Even today's fashion has continued to draw on the legacy of popular Indian designs. Once familiar with the designs, you will begin to spot them everywhere, such as in the repeating floral spray of a printed dress and in the scrolling border of a hemline. Indian trade textiles have left an indelible mark on the way we dress ourselves and decorate our homes. Perhaps even more profoundly, Indian trade textiles are a reminder that the globalised world we live in today has roots that go back thousands of years.

With much of the island a sprawl of brick and steel, it can be easy to forget that Singapore is also home to many creatures that thrived long before man arrived and still survive in surprising numbers in the green lungs of the city. A mere remnant remains of the rainforests, mangroves and coral reefs that once enveloped the island and its coastal fringes with a landscape of trees, swamps and tidal flats. But what habitats exist today harbour a bewildering diversity of wildlife that make Singapore a hotspot for urban biodiversity and a treasure trove of discoveries for students of natural history.
The tiger and tapir are long gone from local jungles, but as of the time of writing in 2011, more than 50 species of mammals still share the island with man, having adapted to life in suburban niches or dwelling in the depths of the near-impenetrable forests. Some, like the Norway rat, are recent arrivals that colonised the island in the wake of vessels drawn to Raffles' promising free port. Others, such as the plantain squirrel and long-tailed macaque, are commonly encountered residents of park edges that offer visitors an untamed counterpoint to manicured hedges.

But many four-legged Singaporeans only cross paths with cityfolk when weekend warriors make inroads into protected zones such as Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and the vast green heartlands that make up the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Boardwalks and broad trails provide safe access to many corners of these refuges. But even a short walk under the dense canopy of an exuberant secondary forest can render the bright lights of the city a distant memory and lure the senses into a world where chirps, whistles, growls and warbles accompany those who keep their mouths shut and eyes (and ears) wide open for a glimpse of the forest's elusive inhabitants.
WHAT LIVES IN THE WOODS
The nature reserves serve as the final strongholds of two notable natives: the banded leaf monkey and the cream-coloured giant squirrel. The former, a robust primate that subsists almost entirely on fruit and young leaves, once ranged all over the island, but now maintains a tenuous existence in the woods around MacRitchie and Lower Peirce Reservoirs.
Recent surveys have found higher numbers than earlier thought, but the population in 2011 of 40 or so individuals is still threatened by high infant mortality, disease and genetic bottlenecks. Compared to the monkeys, the giant squirrel is in far dire straits, with no sightings since 1995. If not already locally extinct, this cat-sized arboreal rodent, which was discovered and scientifically described by Raffles in 1821, faces a bleak future and may well join the bear-like binturong and the red muntjac or barking deer as a permanent victim of overhunting and habitat loss.
One large mammal that has made a comeback after a century of persecution by hunters is the Eurasian wild pig. Also known as the wild boar, populations of this sizeable beast have returned to suitable habitats such as the thick forests around Lower Peirce Reservoir and the woods adjoining Nanyang Technological University in the west of the island. Herds also roam Pulau Ubin, where they frequent the coastal forest of Chek Jawa Wetlands and often surprise visitors with sudden dashes across the paths. Zoologists suspect the current populations originated from animals from Malaysia which swam across the Johor Straits in the past decade. Lacking natural predators such as big cats to control their numbers, the ecological impact of these wild pigs is still unclear. They pose little threat to humans, though, if left alone should one come across a family by the forest trails.

In recent decades, formal protection of Singapore's remaining mangroves has led to the return of another mammal, the smooth otter. Reaching over a metre in length, this aquatic carnivore eats mainly fish and lives in the shelter of coastal mangroves and mudflats. Highly social and vocal creatures that communicate with sharp yelps, otters in pairs or small family groups have been seen in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Pasir Ris Park and Pulau Ubin. Although their habitats are largely protected, the species is still critically endangered in Singapore due to its small population. Abandoned nets left by illegal fishermen may also trap and drown the animals as they chase after prey in murky water. Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is probably the best place to catch sight of these endearing mammals as they nap by the riverbanks on warm afternoons.

Residents of high-rise apartments close to the forests sometimes report seeing a strange creature clinging to trees or the wall of their facility. The culprit is likely to be a lost Sunda colugo, a shy mammal with broad skin membranes between its limbs that allow it to glide through the forest. Sometimes called the flying lemur, despite being unrelated to the Madagascan primates, the colugo occurs in healthy forests and is often spotted at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Nature Park. Colugos feed on leaves at night and spend the day on large tree trunks, where their mottled colours and quiet disposition render them near-invisible to casual observers.

WINGED NATIVES AND WINTER MIGRANTS
Moving from fur to feathers, Singapore offers budding birdwatchers a wealth of colourful fowl if one is willing to look beyond the introduced mynahs, crows and sparrows that feed on urban refuse. But most of the 367 species on the national checklist will reward only twitchers (as keen spotters of rare birds are known) who leave their comfort zones and venture out to the forests, mangroves and coasts. One little red dot, however, can be easily seen at the heliconia groves of the Botanic Gardens. Voted Singapore's national bird in a public poll by the Nature Society in 2002, the crimson sunbird is a hyperactive bundle of feathers that frequents the Gardens to feed on nectar. The male is resplendent in scarlet and electric blue, while the female is a duller blend of olive green and yellow. Sometimes mistaken for hummingbirds, which are found only in the Americas, sunbirds prefer to feed from a perch than hover.

The otters' avian counterparts are the kingfishers. Singapore is home to five resident species of kingfishers as well as three migrants that visit our shores during the winter months. With spear-like bills and the ability to dive into water to snare unsuspecting fish, these charismatic birds also feed on reptiles, insects and even other birds if the chance arises. A harsh, repeated cackle from the treetops is usually a sign that a collared kingfisher has just bagged a meal. The most abundant native kingfisher, this species is a smart white and blue and nests in tree holes. A much more colourful cousin is the blue and orange-brown stork-billed kingfisher, which can be seen at the Botanic Gardens, where individuals perch above the water to seek out aquatic prey.
Seagulls are scarce in Singapore waters, but their close relatives, the terns, are not uncommon along the island's coastline. Clothed in white with webbed feet and slender beaks, these seabirds feed on small fish such as anchovies which they capture by diving from mid-air. One species, the black-naped tern, is probably familiar to Singaporeans who have used the Bird Series $1 currency notes issued between 1976 and 1984. Collected and described by Raffles, this graceful flier nests on isolated outcrops (Pedra Branca is one known nest site) but is threatened by predators such as herons and unscrupulous egg collectors.
WORLD BENEATH THE WAVES
The seas around Singapore, though appearing barren from afar, reveal their secrets when the tide is low enough to unveil an expanse of reefs and seagrass beds. This littoral wealth was noted by early travellers such as John Cameron, who wrote, as he sailed past Bukit Chermin at Telok Blangah, of â€œbeautiful beds of coral, which in their variegated colours and fantastic shapes appear to vie with the scenery above.â€ Nearly 150 years after Cameron's account, Singapore's southern waters still host an incredible diversity of corals, with 255 reef-building species and many others in the shape of fans, whips, flowers and submarine trees. This amounts to nearly half as many coral species as Australia's Great Barrier Reef in an area just less than 0.1% in size.
Seagrasses grow close to the reef flats and shelter fantastic creatures such as sea stars and seahorses. A family of marine plants that bear flowers and fruit, seagrasses are threatened by pollution and coastal development in many tropical regions. Singapore still harbours lush seagrass beds at areas such as Changi, Pulau Semakau, Cyrene Reef and Chek Jawa, a feature that offers possible lessons on how such habitats can thrive amid zones of high human impact. For seafood lovers, it is an issue that hits home, for these ecosystems provide valuable nurseries for prized creatures such as prawns, crabs, sea cucumbers and the young of many edible fish species.
Combining equine and piscine features with the breeding habits of a kangaroo, seahorses devour tiny crustaceans using a tube-shaped mouth and brood their young in a belly pouch, a task undertaken by the male. Though difficult to spot among the seagrass, these unique fishes are threatened by collection for use in traditional Chinese medicine. These slow-moving creatures share their home with sea stars, five-armed spiny animals that use rows of tube feet to move about and lack a head and eyes. One species, formerly common but now abundant only on offshore islands, burrows through loose sand and is often found in a pre-copulatory embrace, in which the male grips the female prior to reproduction. Another large local asteroid (the scientific term for sea stars) is known as the knobbly sea star. Reaching a foot in arm span, these armoured stars come in an array of colours from red to brown to blue to green. Found in seagrass beds and reef flats, knobbly sea stars are endangered by overharvesting for souvenirs or aquaria.
Knobbly sea stars at Cyrene Reef
In the reefs proper, there is a veritable menagerie that few are aware of. For instance, Pulau Hantu, a small island facing the oil refineries of Pulau Bukom, offers divers and waders a chance to see exotic wildlife without having to go to sites such as Tioman or Bali. Surrounded by shallow reefs, the island is home to sea slugs, butterflyfishes, feather stars, sea turtles and many other marine creatures that surprise visitors who explore its waters. Further south, the offshore landfill of Semakau combines a solid waste disposal facility with healthy ecosystems where turtles, sharks and even dolphins have been spotted.
Here, too, are found living homes within a larger home. Carpet-like sea anemones live attached to sand or rock on the reefy fringes of many southern islands. A barrage of sticky tentacles awaits blundering fish and crabs, but some ocean inhabitants have managed to avoid the stings by coating their bodies with a thin layer of slime. Thus protected, tiny shrimp and gaudy anemonefish feed and frolic in the safety of deadly arms. With luck and a little love from fellow Singaporeans who are learning to appreciate the value of their natural heritage, these unassuming creatures will hopefully survive to nurse new generations, find new hosts and enjoy the delight of all who cherish and call this island home.

THOSE THAT SLITHER AND SING
Though not everybody's cup of tea, reptiles and amphibians abound in Singapore's forests. Many are cryptic and camouflaged, and so escape the notice of most people. The green crested lizard can be found in parks such as the Botanic Gardens, where it hunts insects among shrubs and low trees. In turn, it serves as prey for the oriental whip snake, a pretty serpent that blends perfectly with foliage. Mildly venomous but harmless to humans, this snake is an adept climber and gives birth to live young, which are coloured brown.
Oriental whip snake
Reptiles enjoy basking in the sun, but frogs welcome wet days, when their mating calls resound from drains and other damp places. The banded bullfrog is a chubby insectivore with a croak that resembles the bellowing of cattle. Though common throughout the island, this pretty frog is believed to be an introduced species, though one that has not caused discernible harm to true natives. In contrast, the indigenous common greenback emits a bird-like warble and offers a soft chorus of echoes from ponds in city's parks and rural marshes.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Darlene-Kasten-Heritage-Volunteers/story,"A volunteer guide with the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC), Darlene Kasten is meticulous, passionate, and endlessly knowledgeable. Aside from giving tours to the general public, she spends much of her time training new docents, being currently involved in the MHC training team as well as having previously co-led the training team at ACM.
A typical tour with Darlene
â€œWe don't think of it that way,â€ Darlene begins, â€œbut Christianity is an Asian religion.â€ Jesus, after all, was born, lived, preached, and died on the Asian continent. Yet, the â€œChristianity in Asiaâ€ exhibition which Darlene led visitors through at ACM is the only gallery in the world wholly dedicated to sacred Christian art in Asia.
Darlene deftly navigated through the artifacts, reciting incredible details surrounding the art works â€” their form, their histories â€” which she knows like the back of her hand. Visitors are enriched by Darlene's analysis of imagery and symbolism. They can see the Virgin Mary through the eyes of many Asian cultures: in Buddhist robes, donning royal Sri Lankan necklaces, standing upon crescent moons.
From ornate wardrobes and everyday tools to vastly different depictions of Christ across Asia, Darlene covers centuries. Reciting everything from memory, she enthusiastically tells rich and vivid stories that go beyond the museum labels.
While taking great care to point out minute intricacies, Darlene never loses sight of the bigger picture. She links each piece to the greater narrative arc about early Christianity in Asia, taking us through the religion's fascinating journey and evolution through the continent.
Following her interests
Darlene's particular passions often lead people to assume she studied anthropology, history or sociology. Imagine their surprise when Darlene reveals that she was a math and computer sciences major in college. Perhaps this explains her extremely systematic and meticulous approach to history.
Darlene has been doing volunteer work for 30 years. Her colourful experiences cover environmental organisations and conservation projects, from water issues in the US to animal conservation in South Africa.
Upon settling in Singapore in 2016, Darlene naturally gravitated towards similar volunteer projects. She worked with the Jane Goodall Institute and the People's Movement to Stop Haze, before turning her attention to her other passion: societies and culture.
Her love of learning about different cultures led her to apply to be a volunteer at the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC), where she began training within a few weeks of landing in Singapore. Her stint at MHC eventually led her to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and, the rest was history.
Always well prepared
Darlene always checks on all the exhibits before her tours begin, with enough lead time to read up and prepare. The ACM, in particular, has been â€œa never-ending learning experienceâ€ for Darlene. As the museum constantly refreshes itself with new galleries and exhibitions, there is always new knowledge to be acquired.
â€œI am everybody's nightmare, especially as a travel companion!â€ jokes Darlene, when responding to observations about the independent research she does. An avid traveler, Darlene playfully describes how she â€œtormentsâ€ fellow travelers by constantly bombarding them with information. Of course, we can be sure that they are all the better for it.
Besides being a talkative travel mate, Darlene shares another endearing â€œjob hazardâ€ that comes with practising her tour at home. She describes her son's first visit to MHC. She had arrived with him, excited to teach him all about Malay culture, only to find that he already had the information at his fingertips. â€œHe gave me my own spiel!â€, she laughed. â€œI had simply practised my lines so much to him.â€
Offering fresh perspectives
As a non-Singaporean, Darlene is placed in a unique position to observe and scrutinise things that we Singaporeans take for granted. In her role at the Malay Heritage Museum, she offers fresh perspectives from beyond the racial dynamics locals have become familiar with. This frees her from any biases that we Singaporeans may have internalised over time, and allows museum visitors access to new and different ways of looking at our own country and history.
â€œIt is very rewarding, especially when moving to a new country. Becoming a docent is a fast track to deeply understanding local culture,â€ says Darlene. Furthermore, being a docent gives her an opportunity to actively participate in the retelling and sharing of culture. Despite having already been to several archaeological digs in South America, Europe, and South Africa, Darlene reveals that her job as a museum docent excites her more.

Singapore's thriving entrepÃ´t and much talked about commercial vibrancy attracted poverty-stricken Chinese to the island in droves. In search of work and fortune, they took the plunge, boarding overcrowded junks for a perilous journey by sea.
The Chinese of early Singapore
The first bulk of arrivals in Singapore were mainly men who took on backbreaking work moving commodities and cargo from sea vessels to warehouses along the Singapore River.1 Known as coolies, these indentured labourers also worked in construction, agriculture, shipping, mining and rickshaw-pulling.2 As the port town of Singapore evolved, it received a regular influx of Chinese male immigrants. By and large, they came in three large waves between 1823 and 1927.

Unfortunately, life was far from rosy. On top of desperately low wages, and miserable living conditions, the majority of them owed money to middle-men from clan associations and secret societies for arranging passage and work in Singapore. Clan associations were far more understanding of their plight, granting them lodging and protection, as well as aid via mutual assistance schemes. However, immigrants who cut deals with secret societies had to pay membership fees to cover costs in the event they fell ill or died here. As a means of escape, many gambled or smoked opium.
Along the way, the authorities in Singapore curbed the number of male immigrants to the colony and relaxed its policies towards female emigration to even out the gender ratio. Between 1934 and 1938, 200,000 women, affected by economic challenges and a slew of natural calamities in China, came to Singapore.
Here, they found work in tin mines and rubber estates. Those who did general labour at construction sites around the island came to be known as samsui women. They primarily hailed from poor regions in China such as the Samsui district. Their work day usually started at 8am and they were largely tasked to dig soil. They carried earth, debris and building materials in buckets hung from shoulder poles. After work, they returned to tiny shared rooms in Chinatown.

Making a Mark
A number of sojourners to Singapore were so successful in their endeavours that their names have been immortalised around the island.
Take the case of Malacca-born vegetable seller turned tycoon, Tan Tock Seng. A hospital which he helped set up in the 1840s was named after him.5 It stands in Novena today.

Then there was ship chandler and one-time ice merchant Whampoa Hoo Ah Kay who was not only wealthy, but also an accomplished diplomat. A housing estate in a subzone of Balestier bears his name.6
Meanwhile, Hokkien merchant Chia Ann Siang, who traded in spices, coconut, tobacco, tin, tea and silk, has a hill in Chinatown named after him while Peranakan tycoon Tan Kim Seng who donated generously to water works, was honoured with a fountain at Esplanade Park.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-land-before-1819/the-land-before-1819,"At the tip of the Malayan Peninsula, close to the equator, there sits a landscape of generous greenery, hills and valleys between Malaysia and Indonesia. Trees provide shade, and tropical rainforest climate brings high humidity and abundant rain, without any distinct seasons.
This island has had many names over the years.
Why Temasek?
This panorama by well-known artist Percy Carpenter stretches from Pearl's Hill on the left to Tanjong Rhu on the right. It is by far the most extensive view of Singapore from the mid-19th century, featuring the Singapore River settlement almost in its entirety. (c. 1856. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
No one can say for certain what the origins of the name are, despite its regular appearances in early Malay and Javanese texts. However, it has been conjectured that it comes from the Malay word tasik, meaning â€œlakeâ€ or â€œseaâ€, and in this case, probably â€œplace surrounded by the seaâ€ or â€œSea Townâ€.
Even its spelling has taken on many forms; Tumasik in an old Javanese poem in 1365, Chiamassie in a version of Marco Polo's travel account, and Danmaxi as it was referred as by Chinese trader Wang Dayuan.
During the 14th-century, Singapore was also known as Singapura in the Sejarah Melayu or Malay Annals - meaning â€œLion Cityâ€ in Sanskrit. Tan Sri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama) was the man who named the island city as such after a visit in 1299, during which he sighted a â€œlionâ€. However, the events are still a subject of debate today: was Sang Nila Utama a true Srivijayan prince from Palembang, as recorded in the Malay Annals, or was he a mere mythical figure?
Historical Artefacts
These are Javanese-style gold jewellery found at Bukit Larangan. These East Javanese style of these solid gold ornaments is a reminder that in the 14th century, the island of Singapore was under the political and cultural ambit of the East Java-based kingdom of Majapahit. (c. 14th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
A set of Javanese-style jewellery, believed to be from the era of the East Java-based kingdom of Majapahit, which encompassed much of Southeast Asia at its peak in the 14th century, was discovered by a group of Chinese workers at Fort Canning Hill in 1928. This discovery was described in the newspapers as one of British Malaya's most interesting archeological finds. It serves as an indicator of the Majapahit's existence and a reminder that in the 14th century, the island of Singapore was under the political and cultural ambit of the Majapahit Empire before the British arrived in 1819.
Other 14th century artefacts, such as shell remains, animal bones, Chinese coins and ceramics were found after an excavation at Empress Place in 1998 led by Professor John Miksic, providing further physical evidence of material culture from an earlier time. The major find from that excavation was a Javanese-style figurine of a rider on a horse. Made of lead, it is the only statue of its kind that has been discovered in Singapore. Unfortunately, the head of the rider was never found, which gave the statue its â€œHeadless Horsemanâ€ name.
Artefacts include sherds of 14th century Chinese ceramics; Celadons from Longquan, white wares from Dehua; Blue and White from Jingdezhen and Shufu ware. Also discovered were Song Dynasty Chinese coins, bronze fishing hooks bones and earthenware (c. 14th-15th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
There were various shards of Chinese ceramics, including Longquan Celadons, and Song Dynasty Chinese coins. There was also a figurine of a rider on a horse that bears hallmarks of Javanese art from the 14th-century Majapahit Empire and offers evidence of strong trade and cultural links between Java and ancient Singapura.
The Singapore Stone
The area surrounding the river was framed with large rocks, with the Singapore Stone sitting at its mouth â€“ the Rocky Point. It was said to have been hurled there by the legendary Badang, the strongest man in Temasek at that time. Believed to be the oldest record of writing found in Singapore, the stone has inscriptions in the Kawi script and some Sanskrit words, and has been dated to between the 10th and 14th centuries.
This is a fragment from an inscribed monolith known as the 'Singapore Stone'. It is the earliest writing found in Singapore, and was discovered at the mouth of Singapore River, near the present-day Fullerton Hotel. (c. 10th-14th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
All that is left of the stone now is a small fragment with ancient inscriptions that cannot be deciphered. The arrival of the British resulted in the loss of many traces of Ancient Singapura, and the Singapore Stone was eventually blown up in 1843 for the British fort and quarters.

The River of Time
Beyond myths and legends, the Singapore River holds clues and artefacts that can shed light on our rich history. These discoveries help to paint a more complete picture of Singapore's distant past.
Being naturally sheltered by the Southern Islands, the mouth of the Singapore River was the old Port of Singapore. As Singapore lies at the confluence of seasonal winds and monsoons which ships relied on for travel, the river became the centre of trade and commerce.
The river was constantly bustling with activity. The Orang Laut, â€œsea peopleâ€ in Malay, were the earliest known inhabitants around the river, living in sampans at its mouth, and in a village called Kampong Temenggong, located at the north bank of the river, along with other Malays.
With locations such as the Raffles Landing Site, a swimming spot for children at high tide, and where bridges provide connections between people and places then and now, the Singapore River is a symbol of the past and present coexisting side by side.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-tale-of-three-lighthouses/story,"Back in 1819, the British set up a trading settlement on the tiny island now known as Singapore. As they established a port in the southern part of mainland Singapore, it was only natural that they would need a communications centre to handle the administrative and operational matters relating to the port. The British eventually chose to set up a port communications centre on Fort Canning Hill as it was a strategic location which overlooked the Singapore Harbour.

Fort Canning Lighthouse
A flagstaff was built on the hill and it was used to transmit important details to the ships entering the Singapore harbour. By 1855, a simple lantern that doubled as a signal light was attached to the top of the flagstaff. The flagstaff light was replaced by the Fort Canning Lighthouse in 1902, which was constructed by Riley, Hargreaves and Company on the southern part of the hill.

The 24.3-metre high Fort Canning Lighthouse shone 20,000 candelas worth of light which was generated by a vaporised kerosene burner. The lighthouse's beam occulted for three seconds every 17 seconds through the lowering of a metal cylinder around the burner.
Interestingly, when the old Supreme Court was being built on St Andrews Road from 1937 to 1939, the architects were instructed to ensure that the building did not obstruct the view of the Fort Canning Lighthouse. The lighthouse guided ships safely into the Singapore Harbour for 55 years until it was decommissioned on 12 December 1958, when tall buildings built along the Singapore Harbour had hampered its visibility from the sea.

Although the original Fort Canning Lighthouse survived the Second World War, the current one that you see standing in its original location is a fully-functional replica. In April 2014, the Fort Canning Lighthouse shone its light again after more than half a century as the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) launched Singapore's first maritime trails. Since then, the replica remains lit at night.
Fullerton Lighthouse
After the Fort Canning Lighthouse was dismantled, a lighthouse was fitted on top of the Fullerton Building as a replacement. The Fullerton Building, situated at the mouth of the Singapore River, is a significant part of Singapore's history having housed the General Post Office since its opening in 1928. The building survived the Second World War too and after the General Post Office moved out in 1996, this historical landmark was placed under conservation the following year. The building that stands at 1 Fullerton Square today underwent restoration works from 1998 to 2000 and was subsequently converted into the Fullerton Hotel which was officially opened in January, 2001 by the then Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Goh Chok Tong.
The Fullerton Lighthouse consisted of a round lantern with an aerobeacon in it. The revolving beacon stood about 48 metres above sea level shining 540,000 candelas worth of light which could be seen by ships up to 29 kilometres away.

The lighthouse was eventually decommissioned in 1978 as its function was limited by the growing Singapore skyline. In 1985, the lantern in the lighthouse was transferred to the Singapore Maritime Museum as a working exhibit. However, the artefact can now be found on display in an open site near Harbourfront Tower One after the museum closed in 2001. Today, the original site of the Fullerton Light on the 8th floor of the Fullerton Hotel has been transformed into a fine dining restaurant called The Lighthouse.

Bedok Lighthouse
The Fullerton Lighthouse was subsequently replaced by the Bedok Lighthouse. The Bedok Lighthouse is special in more ways than one. It was Singapore's first fully automated and unmanned lighthouse, and was launched on Singapore's National Day in 1978. In addition, it was the first lighthouse built atop a residential building on mainland Singapore. It is still functioning today on the roof of a 26-storey block in the Lagoon View condominium along Marine Parade Road.
The lighthouse flashes a beam of light 600,000 candela strong once every five seconds and has been reported to be visible up to 40 kilometres away at sea. The Bedok Lighthouse also helped pilots to navigate around Singapore's airspace.
Bedok Lighthouse, 2014.
An additional lighthouse on mainland Singapore will be built to complement the Bedok Lighthouse.  It sits atop a nearby 25-storey Housing & Development Board (HDB) block along Marine Terrace. A closed-circuit television (CCTV) and electro-optic camera, as well as radio communications equipment will be installed at the new lighthouse to improve its functions and to boost its security.
This tale of the three lighthouses depicts the story of navigational infrastructure, such as lighthouses, evolving alongside the city state's development. This highlights the need to always remain relevant amidst modernisation and advances in technology.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/tan-kah-kee/story,"TL;DR
Philanthropic tycoon Tan Kah Kee (21 October 1874-12 August 1961) whom a MRT station is named after, was a larger-than-life kind of guy. When he died in Beijing, China, the Chinese government held a national funeral in honour of his contributions.1 What did he achieve in his lifetime exactly? His businesses created jobs for more than 30,000 people in Singapore and abroad. Tan, who married four times, lobbied against the war-bent Japanese, set up 100 educational institutions2, and also found the time to establish two newspapers.
Singapore's Very Own Henry Ford
Tan Kah Kee left his home town in Fujian, China for Singapore at the age of 16, having received a Confucian-centric education.
At work, Tan was diligent, rising through the ranks of Chop Soon Ann, his father's rice mill and sundries business in Singapore.3 By the 1900s, his father's business ventures began to falter4 as a result of misappropriation and mismanagement. Tan worked to shut the companies down and was singularly focused on clearing their debts.
Tan later built his own empire. From a single pineapple canning factory, Tan soon had three such enterprises under his name.5 With these successes, he was able to buy back the original home of Chop Soon Ann in North Boat Quay.6 There, he established the Khiam Aik rice mill.7 When his businesses faced setbacks, he branched out into new markets and other sectors, staying nimble and conscious of global trends. At one point, his empire comprised pineapple and rubber plantations, rice mills and a biscuit factory. Tan also got involved in the shipping industry as well as the manufacture of tyres and shoes.8

At one point, his empire comprised pineapple and rubber plantations, rice mills and a biscuit factory. Tan also got involved in the shipping industry as well as the manufacture of tyres and shoes.8
In the mid-1920s, Tan's empire created jobs for more than 30,000 people in Singapore and beyond. His success was attributed to his fastidious nature and involvement in all stages of the supply chain â€” much like Henry Ford, the great industrialist.9 Tan took several employees under his wing, his mentorship and tutelage leading to the rise of other movers and shakers such as Lee Kong Chian and Tan Lark Sye.10
Tan's businesses wound up â€œnaturallyâ€, having been impacted by international financial cycles and catastrophes such as the Great Depression.11 Historian Wang Gungwu, who described Tan as â€œone of the earliest global Chinese entrepreneurs that the Nanyang producedâ€, said it was precisely because of the global reach of his businesses that Tan was subjected to such crashes.12
Instead of resting on his laurels, Tan reinvented himself to serve his communities in Singapore and China.

Confucian consciousness
A firm believer in education as a social leveller, and continually guided by Confucian values, Tan was involved in setting up more than 10 schools and institutes such as Tao Nan School, Ai Tong School, and The Chinese High School (now Haw Chong Institution after a merger with Hwa Chong Junior College)13 in Singapore. In China, he pushed for the establishment of Xiamen University.14

In 1923, Tan started Nanyang Siang Pau, a Chinese newspaper to encourage a reading culture and promote businesses. 15
In 1929, he was elected to serve as president of the Hokkien Huay Kuan.16 He used its platform to call for unity among Singapore's varied Chinese dialect communities and to put an end to social ills such as opium addiction.
His mind was also on his home country. To this end, he set up a number of funds to provide relief for flooding victims, and to render aid following the outbreak of war between China and Japan in 1937. The following year, he served as head of the South-East Asia Federation of the China Relief Fund to further support the anti-war effort.
When the Japanese reached Singapore in 1942, Tan rallied members of the Chinese community to aid the British in repelling the invaders.17 For all his anti-war efforts, Tan was a prime target of the Japanese and thus had little choice but to leave Singapore. He ended up in Marang, Indonesia where he spent his time writing.18

After the war, Tan returned to Singapore and launched the Nan Chiao Jit Poh, a newspaper which took on an unfavourable tone towards the ruling Kuomintang in China. The British, fearing that the growing politicisation of Chinese in Malaya and Singapore, grew increasingly apprehensive about individuals such as Tan.19 At one point, they even considered cancelling his British citizenship.20 Tan left Singapore for China in 1950, and in 1957, renounced his British citizenship. In China, he dedicated his resources towards rebuilding and reconstruction efforts.
When he died in Beijing, China at 87, Tan was given a state funeral by the Chinese government to honour his contributions. His final resting place is in Ao Yuan, Jimei, China. In Singapore he's remembered in various ways. For instance, a train station which opened in Bukit Timah in 2015 bears his name.

â€œOn an old building, you can see the handiwork of many anonymous craftsmen from centuries ago,â€ he says. â€œAll these things are made by hand: the columns, the plasterwork flowers, the carvings on windows, and the choice of coloured glass.â€
He notes that Singapore is a truly unique city because it contains architecture from all over the world. On a single street, you can find buildings that reflect traditions from Europe, China, India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.
This is why he is trying to protect our built heritage. He works at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the government's department for city planning, land use and conservation. His position is the Director of Conservation Management, which means that he is in charge of looking after our architecture for future generations.
Part of his job is making sure that heritage buildings are not damaged. Sometimes, when people install windows, signs or air conditioners in an old building, they change its overall design. He has to tell these people to have the building changed back.
Reaching out
Another more interesting part of his job is education and outreach. â€œHow do you make 7,000 heritage buildings meaningful to the population?â€ he asks. â€œWe have to carry out programmes so that people can appreciate and enjoy these buildings.â€
One of these programmes involves students from the Tourism Club of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West. He has trained them to lead guided walks in Tiong Bahru, so that they can present the history of this neighbourhood to visitors.
Another programme involves young filmmakers from Nanyang Technological University. They create short documentaries about heritage buildings like the Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, and the Central Fire Station. You can watch these on URA's YouTube channel.
Mr Ang believes that it is important for young people to have a connection to old buildings. But, this does not mean they must study facts about when these structures were built. It means they should spend time there, creating happy memories of their own.
He smiles whenever he sees folks taking graduation photos or selfies at old monuments. â€œThey are making these places part of their personal life stories,â€ he says. â€œWithout these stories, the buildings are just bricks and mortar.â€
Vivid memories
Mr Ang was born in 1972. Like most Singaporeans, he grew up in an HDB estate. But, his mother often took him to Chinatown to visit friends and relatives. He was captivated by the sight of the crumbling old shophouses, and by the way people made use of the five-foot ways â€“ the covered walkways between the buildings and the road.
â€œThe five-foot ways of Chinatown were a kaleidoscope of possible adventures,â€ he says. â€œEverything was on display: there were people trading, doing homework, telling fortunes.â€ He also has a vivid memory of visiting a shophouse that had been turned into a Taoist temple. It contained a holy python kept in a red metal cage. He could see a big lump in the python's belly because it had just been fed a whole chicken.
Looking back, he realises these childhood experiences gave him a special connection to Chinatown's shophouses. â€œThese buildings are important to me, not because of history books, but because they are part of my story as a citizen,â€ he says.
As a teenager, he discovered a book called Characters of Light: A Guide to the Buildings of Singapore by Marjorie Doggett. It was full of beautifully taken photographs of places like St Andrew's Cathedral and Sri Mariamman Temple. Sharing it with his family members, he found that the photos made them talk about their own early memories. This was how he learned that art can play a part in preserving heritage.
Special features
But, it was only after he started working for URA that he truly began to appreciate our architecture. He learned that many old buildings were specially designed to keep a space cool without the use of electricity. For instance, traditional shophouse windows have shutters made of slanted pieces of wood. They allow air and light to enter a room, but they also block out the rain and most of the heat.
The five-foot way was also designed to protect people from the rain and the sun. However, it functions as a public space as well, where strangers can bump into one another and become friends. A couple of Mr Ang's friends met each other in the five-foot way, and later even got married!
This is an example of how architecture can actually build communities. â€œIn a city of millions, you do need small spaces where it is more intimate,â€ he says. He firmly believes that today's architects have a lot to learn from builders of the past.
Of course, Singapore must change to keep up with the times. Sometimes, old buildings must be demolished so that new, modern buildings can take their place. Nevertheless, Mr Ang is working to ensure that some areas of the city remain the same, so that people can relive their memories whenever they pass them.
â€œI have friends who took their wedding pictures at Cavenagh Bridge, and now whenever they cross the bridge, they think, â€˜How nice, this place hasn't really changed',â€ he says. â€œIt's all very romantic. And, good cities need a layer of romance.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-devagi-sanmugam/story,"Like many of us, Devagi Sanmugam (say â€œDay-vuh-gi sun-moo-gumâ€) enjoys looking at pictures of food on Instagram. However, she has noticed a disturbing pattern. Her friends mostly post images of western dishes, like Italian pasta and French almond cookies. It is much rarer for them to post images of local cuisine.
â€œPeople have gone berserk about food, but not food from their own backgrounds,â€ she says. As a cooking instructor, she has noticed the same thing among her students in Singapore. They long to work in famous Western restaurants. But, they do not know much about how to cook Asian food.
This is why she decided to publish her newest cookbook, I Am a Rice Cooker! It features information about forty different Asian cooking techniques, such as stir-frying, doubleboiling and dum cooking. It also lists one hundred recipes, representing the cuisines of ten Asian cultures. Last month, it won the third prize in the Global Finals of the Gourmand International Cookbook Awards, Cooking Schools Category.
According to Ms Devagi, Asian cuisine is more complex than western cuisine. For instance, while westerners recognise four basic tastes â€“ sweet, salty, sour and bitter â€“ the Japanese recognise a fifth taste: umami, or meatiness. Indians claim there are six tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, spicy and astringent (a taste that leaves a dry flavour in the mouth).
Furthermore, Asian foods often emphasise flavours that are overlooked in western cuisine. While western chefs avoid creating dishes that are sour or bitter, Asian chefs highlight these flavours with foods like assam fish and bittergourd.
Learning from mother
â€œAs an Asian, it's important to know your Asian cooking skills,â€ Ms Devagi says. â€œIf you can master that, then you can master everything else very easily.â€ Surprisingly, she was never professionally trained as a cook. She learned her skills from her mother, her grandmother and her aunt, by helping them in the kitchen as a little girl.
She was born in 1956. Back then, everyone cooked food on a stove by burning gas, charcoal or wood. â€œI learned a lot about fire,â€ she says. â€œFire is the most important thing for a chef. You have to learn how to control it. It brings out the best in food, and the smell of smoke makes such a difference.â€ She has very fond memories of her childhood meals. Her family was poor, but her mother cooked so well that they ate like kings.
She had six younger brothers and sisters, and her father could not afford school fees for everyone. So, after finishing Secondary Four, she started work. At her first job, she would sometimes surprise her colleagues by making cakes and kueh for them. They adored her cooking. This inspired her to become a cooking instructor.
With the support of her husband, she started Indian cooking classes in her flat. At first, she did not have many students. â€œI was only 28 years old, and everyone questioned me about my experience,â€ she says. Then, in 1983, an article in Her World magazine called her Singapore's best Indian cooking instructor. The reporter loved the lively way she taught. â€œShe said I was like a chili padi with a lot of punch!â€ she laughs. She began writing a cooking column for the magazine. In the 1990s, when Singaporeans were getting interested in wine appreciation classes, she started holding spice appreciation classes. This was how she got her nickname, â€œthe Spice Queen of Singaporeâ€.
The value of good cooking
Today, she still specialises in Indian food. But, she also has become an expert in the cuisines of many other Asian countries. She travels to cooking schools across world to do a one-week programme, called Tastes of Asia.
She worries that people here in Singapore are forgetting the value of good cooking and family recipes passed through generations as all of these form part of our intangible cultural heritage. She notes that her sisters say they have no time to cook lunch. They usually buy food from a stall â€“ and then complain that it tastes awful. That is a miserable way to live, she feels. â€œIf you are eating food and you feel it's terrible, it's not going to nourish you at all.â€
Luckily, she knows that her recipes will be passed down for another generation. She has published 22 cookbooks so far, and has taught countless people her techniques. Although she has no children herself, she proudly tells me that all twenty of her nieces and nephews are good cooks. It is young people like them who will continue to keep the traditions of Asian cooking alive.

Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2012
Heritage is indeed alive and living amongst us, literally!
Not many people realise the magnificent Tembusu tree featured on Singapore's five-dollar note is a Heritage Tree. Another well-known Heritage Tree is the towering Angsana tree along Upper Serangoon Road, near Woodleigh Park.
Angsana Tree at Upper Serangoon Road.
What are Heritage Trees? These are trees recognised and conserved under the Heritage Tree Scheme. The scheme was started in 2001 by the National Parks Board (NParks) to conserve magnificent mature trees in our landscape.
In the same year, the Heritage Road Scheme was also initiated. It seeks to conserve the unique tree-scapes along some roads in Singapore. Preservation of these Heritage Roads adds an element of permanence to the landscape, and contributes to Singapore's sense of identity, history and continuity.
Introducing our Heritage Trees
The Heritage Tree Scheme was created to identify, recognise and preserve significant and valuable trees in the country's landscape. As natural living landmarks of Singapore, our Heritage Trees hold important links to our past as we go forward into the future. The scheme also promotes the appreciation of these trees.
Heritage Trees are recognised for their girth (circumference of tree trunk measured one metre from the ground), size, aesthetic, rarity, as well as social, cultural and historical significance.
Out of the current 257 Heritage Trees as of 2018, 60 are located in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, including the Tembusu (Fragraea fragrans) featured on the back of Singapore's five-dollar note.
Tembusu in the Botanic Gardens.
Reportedly more than 150 years old, this Tembusu tree has a girth spanning more than 7.8 metres in circumference and stands at a height of 30 metres. It is easily recognised by its signature lower branch.
>Isn't it wonderful to know that you carry an image of Singapore's Tembusu Heritage Tree with you all the time?
The Tembusu tree is an evergreen with deeply fissured tree bark. The wood is durable and hardy; in olden days, its trunk was used to make chopping boards. The Tembusu tree has a relatively regular flowering pattern, which occurs twice a year â€“ usually in May or early June and October or November. During flowering seasons, its creamy-white blooms emit an enticing fragrance. You will not miss their perfume, especially in the late evening when the fragrance is stronger.
Another majestic Heritage Tree in the Singapore Botanic Gardens is the Penaga Laut (Calophyllum inophyllum), located next to the Botany Centre. This slow-growing evergreen Penaga Laut Tree is more than 100 years old. It plays host to several other life forms such as ferns, climbers and small animals. You may chance upon a squirrel scuttling among its branches as you admire the tree.
â€œCalophyllumâ€ means â€œbeautiful leafâ€ in Greek, and that aptly describes the tree's beautiful leathery leaves, with their numerous slender veins.
The Penaga Laut is exceptional as all parts of the tree â€“ namely the leaves, bark, flowers, fruits, seeds and roots â€“ can be used for medicinal purposes to treat various ailments such as skin disease, piles and chickenpox. The seeds produce fragrant oil that is valued by some as a natural moisturiser. This oil is also largely used in cosmetics and soap-making, or even as burning fuel. The wood of this tree can be used for heavy construction, such as furniture and shipbuilding.
The Tembusu Heritage Tree and the Penaga Laut Heritage Tree in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, as well as the other 257 Heritage Trees located all over Singapore as of 2018, can be easily located as all of them are listed in the Heritage Tree Registrar on the NParks website.
Nominate A Tree!
Anyone can nominate a tree for heritage status, and help contribute to Singapore's sense of identity, history and continuity.
If you come across any tree which has the potential to be a Heritage Tree, you can nominate it by simply filling up a form at the NParks' website. Nominated trees will be inspected by NParks' arborists (â€œtree doctorsâ€) and assessed by the Heritage Tree Panel to determine their suitability as Heritage Trees.
Our Heritage Roads
Another interesting segment of Singapore's living heritage is the Heritage Roads. Currently, we have gazetted five Heritage Roads to promote the conservation of these scenic and significant tree-lined roads in Singapore. They are Arcadia Road, Lim Chu Kang Road, Mandai Road, Mount Pleasant Road and South Buona Vista Road.
Heritage Roads include South Bouna Vista Road (above) and Arcadia Road..
Heritage Roads are easily recognised by the wide canopies extending from the big trees overhanging these roads, forming a green tunnel and providing much needed shade from our scorching sun.
Travelling along Mandai Road is a pleasant and tranquil experience, as adjoining the road is the scenic Upper Seletar Reservoir Park. The starting point of this Heritage Road is opposite Upper Seletar Reservoir Car Park, and it ends at the junction with Mandai Avenue.
Green Tunnel"" effect along Mandai Road, one of the five Heritage Roads in Singapore.
Constructed in 1855, this road used to be an old carriageway that served as one of the main links between Woodlands and Upper Thomson, connecting the agriculture and poultry farming villages in the area.
Another Heritage Road is South Buona Vista Road, which begins before the junction with Storkport Road and ends at the junction with Vigilante Drive. Constructed before World War Two, South Buona Vista Road (means â€œa good viewâ€ in Italian) used to offer elevated views of the sea. It was on this part of the ridge that the famous battle of Pasir Panjang was fought in February 1942. South Buona Vista Road is also distinctive for its many curves. Lining the sides of the road are mainly Tembusu and Yellow Flame trees, as well as other mature trees.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/hazel-locke-memories-of-world-war-ii/story,"Hazel Locke recalls vivid scenes of the war reaching Singapore decades ago when she was a young woman.
Hazel as a sergeant with the Women's Auxiliary Corps, India who helped with military communications in code work.
When World War II began, on 8 December 1941, I was at a cinema called the Alhambra opposite Raffles Hotel. Suddenly, on the screen there was a news flash. Japan had declared war.
Singapore was not affected at the beginning. People went about their business as I did, going to work at Cold Storage till the time came when bombs were falling in parts of Singapore. Orchard Road was probably the first area to be hit.
The â€œ10-cent shopsâ€ â€” where everything cost 10 cents â€” were very popular with the people. The shops were operated by the Japanese. Before the war, all the shops â€œdisappearedâ€ (closed down), which led to word getting around that the shop keepers were spies.
At my workplace 
I was at work manning the switch board, when two bombs hit the Cold Storage building. One fell on a corner of the supermarket. The other hit the sausage and kitchen department, which was separated from the supermarket by a garage that housed the delivery vans. One of the two bombs hit a pipe releasing ammonia that was so thick on the ground, that we all scrambled up a spiral staircase to get to the top of the building to fresh air. 
At the time, I was in the midst of all the scrambling. I remember going up the spiral staircase with the rest of the people. I heard someone tell us to try and find a hanky or any other cloth, to wet it and cover our noses and mouths with it. It was better when we reached the top. I am glad to say no one was injured.
Going back a bit, before bombs fell, we (the girls in the order department) had been told to stay at our positions by the manager, Mr Fincher, till he gave the go ahead to take cover. When he told us to go for cover, I was at the switch board and was told to ring the sausage and kitchen department where there were three workers who had also been told to stay in their positions till they got the order to take cover.
I remember ringing non-stop, but no one picked up the phone. Mr Fincher was getting very anxious and came back again and again, but saw that I was still trying to get someone to answer. He then told me to go for cover. But, after trying for so long, I was not prepared to give up. I gave one last ring, and this time someone picked up the phone, and I shouted at him to take cover, just in time before a bomb hit the building.
Luckily, in that raid no one was hurt.
Last-minute decision
Another important story was how lucky my mother, sister, youngest brother, and I were to escape the Japanese occupation of Singapore. At first, my family had no plans to leave Singapore, but my late Uncle Basil Johannes came to our house on the 6th of February, in the late evening at about 6 o'clock, and told my father off about not doing anything to get us away. It was a last-minute decision, so much so that all my mother could do was to gather some clothes and put them in a sheet to carry on board.
Thinking back, I never questioned how my father and brothers, Osbert and Balfour, managed to get us to the wharf. We were living in a shop house at Serangoon Road, and there must have been a problem getting a taxi that was operating during the curfew because it was hours before we arrived at the wharf.
All I knew was that my brother Balfour, with a torch in hand shining on the road so that the taxi driver could see, was running alongside the taxi. It was pitch dark because of the curfew. It was quite a miracle that a taxi driver was willing to take us to the wharf during the curfew. My father had made all the arrangements as he and my elder brother were immigration officers and were waiting for us at the port gates.
I never found out how my father and brothers returned home.
The British government had sent ships to evacuate women and children who wished to leave Singapore. My mother, carrying clothes bundled in a white sheet, and the three children were among the last fleeing passengers to board the Felix Roussel, one of the last three big ships at the wharf waiting to carry evacuees to safety in India. We wanted to go on the Devonshire because my late uncle was on it, but it was full.
On the ship
I remember that no sooner were we on the gangway than the sirens sounded. Troops were dismounting from another gangway at the other end of the ship. Those who fled Singapore were mainly women and children.
I can remember being in one of the cabins downstairs. I looked through the porthole and saw Japanese planes looking like toy planes in the sky, and a bomb falling and just missing the ship. I'll never forget that. The captains of all three ships instantly gave orders to pull up the gangways and took off.
Life on the ship was hard. There was only preserved food that was already nine months old as the ship had no time to take on board fresh food. Japanese planes had been spotted headed to the port. Once, I had to eat a piece of cheese that was so hard it cut my lips. When I arrived in India, I was overjoyed when, at my first meal, I was given what I thought was a jug of orange juice. I took a sip, and realised it was actually orange muddy water.
Luckily, all three ships managed to get away and brought those on board to safety in India, where we were given refuge throughout the war.
Not all survived
Sadly, I heard all other ships, smaller ones that carried evacuees, were not so lucky, particularly one that left on the 13th of February. If I remember correctly, it was a Friday. I remember a Greek woman with her identical twin were on one of the ships that was bombed. With the rest who were on board, they found themselves in the water fighting for their lives.
According to the woman, she got parted from her twin. She was one of those who were picked up and arrived safely in India, eventually. She mentioned that some people managed to get to the islands around Singapore.
She was so upset and never stopped pining for her twin.  I do not know whether she was ever reunited with her twin because we were put in groups and sent to Coimbatore, but she was not in our group.
Refuge in India
When we arrived in India, it was at Bombay (Mumbai today). We were housed in the rajah's domains. The one we were in, I believe was haunted. I woke up one night because I heard a heavy flow of water running from the tap in the bathroom â€” so I got up and went to shut it off. But, when I got to the bathroom it was perfectly dry! It was an eerie moment for me!!
Surprisingly, I had rather a good time as a refugee. My family stayed in Coimbatore, which was then just a quiet town. As there were no cars, I often had to travel in a jutkah, which was a man-driven atap-covered wagon drawn by bullocks. I used to jump in the back and sit with my legs dangling. 
There was a huge dance hall where the British Fleet Air-Arm held dance parties with women from the town and the women refugees every few weeks, dancing the night away.
I even ended up joining the army myself. I was a sergeant with the Women's Auxiliary Corps, India, and helped with military communications in code work. I was posted all over India and received three award ribbons for my services.
At the end of the war, we were returned to our respective countries. I was reunited with my father, sister and brothers. They never described their war experiences, but I knew they had experienced terrible starvation and torture.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-lai-ah-eng/story,"When Dr Lai Ah Eng was a little girl, one of her teachers insulted her and her friends for being poor. â€œYou girls will never eat cream,â€ the teacher said. â€œYou will only eat cow dung.â€
Her father had migrated to Malaysia from Hainan Island in China around the year 1930. He was so poor and uneducated, he did not even know how to read or write. Luckily, he was able to make a living by running a kopitiam, or coffee shop, in the city of Kuala Lumpur.
Every morning, he would wake up at five o'clock to light a fire in the oven, slice the bread, and prepare coffee for his customers. People would begin arriving just before six to hear the first broadcasts on the Rediffusion radio station.
Growing up
Growing up in the sixties, Dr Lai was able to study at the free school nearby. But, after classes, she had to help out with the business, together with her mother and four sisters. She would try to do her homework at the counter, when she did not have to wash the cups and spoons, sell cigarettes, and sweep the floor before closing. Usually, they would not finish work until ten or eleven at night.
At first, she hated the work. She secretly made a promise to herself: â€œI'll never marry someone who runs a coffeeshop!â€ But, after some time, she began to appreciate how important the place was. It was a place for the community to gather and enjoy cheap, good food while listening to the news on the radio.
It was also a very multicultural place. Besides their own bread and coffee, they sold nasi lemak and pisang goreng, made by a Malay neighbour. Sometimes, people set up their own food stalls beside the shop, including an Indian woman who sold appam and a Hakka woman who sold laksa.
At one point, developers bought the land and announced that they would demolish the shophouse. â€œMy father was so depressed, his hair suddenly turned white in one month,â€ Dr Lai remembers. Thankfully, an Indian man across the street offered to let the family take over his shop, free of charge, because he was returning to India.
A training ground
Today, Dr Lai is a professor at the National University of Singapore. She is an anthropologist: a person who studies human societies and cultures. She suspects that working at her father's kopitiam was good training for the job. It was a centre of activity and a window to the world.
Five years ago, she was part of a team of researchers studying migration. Most of her colleagues were focusing on new immigrants to Singapore. She, on the other hand, decided to look at how older immigrants had become part of our community. She did this by studying the history of kopitiams.
She learned that many early kopitiam owners were Hainanese, just like her father. For instance, the famous Ya Kun Kaya Toast business was originally a food stall set up by Loh Ah Koon, a Hainanese immigrant who came to Singapore in 1926 when he was just 15 years old. Jack's Place, Han's and Killiney Kopitiam were all also founded by Hainanese people. The cooks served Asian versions of western foods, such as toasted bread and pork chops, because many of them had worked as servants in British homes.
But, it was not only the Hainanese who ran food stalls. Immigrants from other parts of Asia did the same thing. In 1924, a man named Bhavan from India set up Ananda Bhavan, which is now a vegetarian restaurant chain. In 1958, a Sumatran immigrant set up Sabar Menanti, which still sells nasi padang in Kampong Glam.
Our kopitiam heritage
From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Housing Development Board (HDB) began to move people from kampungs into public housing estates. They also opened new kopitiams in these areas, bringing together stallholders and customers of different races. â€œThe kopitiam naturally became one of the first public gathering sites for those disoriented by resettlement,â€ Dr Lai says. Old friends could meet there and also make friends with their new neighbours. They also began to enjoy each other's foods, giving birth to the multicultural Singaporean cuisine that we know today.
However, these kopitiams are now under threat. Previously, neighbourhood kopitiams were mostly owned by stallholders. But, since 2001, many kopitiams have been taken over by chain operators such as Koufu, S11, Food Republic and Kopitiam.
These businesses often renovate the spaces, charge higher rents, and then sell them again to make a profit â€“ sometimes just after a few years, or even months! As a result, the rents for stallholders keep going up. Because of the expense, many stalls are closing.
We, Singaporeans, are proud of our kopitiam heritage. This is why Ya Kun and Killiney use nostalgic items like wooden stools in their shops, to bring back memories of the â€œgood old daysâ€. But, big businesses are making it almost impossible to succeed as a stallholder now. Dr Lai notes that if her father had migrated in modern times, his business would never have been able to survive.
The Government is working to address the current situation. They have stopped allowing sales of their newly built kopitiams, and only rent out them to operators to help keep costs reasonable. But, we should do more so that our beloved kopitiams may be enjoyed by future generations of Singaporeans.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-kennie-ting/story,"When he was a young man, Kennie Ting was bothered by a peculiar question: â€œWhy am I who I am?â€
He felt that his culture was quite weird. He was Chinese, but his first language was English. He also loved lots of different foods, like Hainanese chicken rice, Malay sambal and Indian fish-head curry.
After doing some research, he realised he had become this way because of Singaporean history. Our island has always been a trading port where people of different cultures have come together, exchanging goods and ideas. As a result, everyone here has an identity that is a bit mixed up.
You might think this is a bad thing. After all, it can be confusing not to know exactly who you are. But, it also means that we have a fantastically rich heritage. We can look at the cultures of many different lands, and see how they have influenced our own lives.
Heritage may be ancient
Mr Ting now has the chance to help more people learn about our heritage. In September 2016, he became the Director of the Asian Civilisations Museum. This means he is in charge of displaying some truly marvellous objects from all over Asia, such as paintings, jewellery, costumes and statues of gods. Some of these items are thousands of years old.
His job is exhausting. He has to spend all day meeting different people, explaining his ideas about the museum's programmes. He speaks to politicians, religious groups, tour guides, tourists, business leaders, art collectors and schoolchildren. He also has to wear a formal suit when he addresses them, when he would really prefer to be hanging out in a T-shirt and slippers.
Fortunately, he is still enthusiastic about his work. â€œIt's a wonderful opportunity to shape the museum in the way I want to,â€ he says. â€œWorking with this beautiful collection is quite exciting.â€
In November 2016, he opened an exhibition called â€œPort Citiesâ€. It featured historical objects from many Asian cities, including Singapore, Manila, Guangzhou (which was once called Canton) and Kolkata (which was once called Calcutta). These places were connected by shipping routes, so they became very multicultural.
If you had visited the show, you would have seen a portrait of Cornelia van Nijenroode, a wealthy half-Dutch, half-Japanese woman who lived in Indonesia in the 1600s. Also featured in the show was a necklace made of French gold coins, owned by the Tamil moneylenders of Vietnam in the 1800s. These objects show that many people in the past had mixed-up identities, just like us.
The exhibition meant a lot to Mr Ting. He has explored many Asian cities, learning how their cultures are linked. He has even written a book about this topic, The Romance of the Grand Tour: 100 Years of Travel in Southeast Asia.
Sadly, he feels that these cities became less multicultural in the 20th century. Often, this is because their governments emphasised one culture over all the others. As a result, Guangzhou became more Chinese and Kolkata became more Indian.
But, in Singapore, something different happened. Because we were both a city and a country, we made multiculturalism part of our national identity. â€œWe are in a unique position,â€ Mr Ting says. â€œWe have a perspective that no-one else has.â€
Heritage is all around
Lately, Mr Ting has been thinking a lot about â€œintangible heritageâ€. This is heritage that is not made up of objects in galleries, but activities and knowledge.
He is trying to spread awareness about this through a programme called the Asian Culture and Music Series. Visitors will be able to watch events such as Burmese puppetry shows and Indonesian gamelan concerts for free.
However, the term â€œintangible heritageâ€ covers much more than just the performing arts. It also includes the languages we speak, the games we play, the meals we eat, our religious ceremonies and our holiday celebrations.
For this reason, Mr Ting says, â€œTo say you have no heritage is nonsense. All Singaporeans are experts in Singapore heritage.â€ You may be a kid, but you already know a lot about the customs and beliefs of your family. You also know many interesting things about being a kid in the early 21st century. These things may seem ordinary now, but they are part of your identity, and they are important.
The truth is, heritage is everywhere, not just in museums. â€œThere are interesting and amazing things all around us,â€ says Mr Ting. â€œJust open your eyes. The things that you take for granted may be absolutely wonderful if you just dig into where they came from.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-som-said/story,"Som Said is Singapore's most famous Malay dance choreographer, and she cares deeply about heritage. In fact, she has spent over fifty years performing and teaching traditional Malay dance.
However, her love for the past has never stopped her from trying new things. Over the years, she has created many innovative performances, sometimes by borrowing dance techniques from other cultures or by using modern technology.
For example, last year, her company staged an event at the Malay Heritage Centre called â€œInspirasi 9â€. It took place over two nights. On 11 November, dancers mostly performed folk dances, such as masri, joget and zapin. But, on 12 November, they put up contemporary works, interacting with video and live computer animations.
â€œTradition is not static,â€ she explains. â€œWhen heritage is passed down from generation to generation, it has to keep moving to stay relevant.â€
Growing up with dance
When Madam Som was a little girl in the 1950s, she did not have a dance teacher. Instead, she learned dance by watching movies. She would go to the cinema with her sisters to watch Malay films, then spend hours at home in front of her mirror, trying to imitate them. (She says it was quite similar to how kids today learn dance from YouTube!)
She began teaching her schoolmates the dance routines. By Primary Two, she was already creating dance performances for her school's Sports Day. Then, while she was in Anderson Secondary School, her friend invited her to join her father's dance troupe, Sriwana. She began taking part in public performances at the age of 14, in the year 1965.
â€œSriwana did folk dance, but we did not emphasise tradition,â€ Madam Som remembers. â€œWe also did modern dance to pop songs. During that time, people didn't care about what was traditional and what was modern.â€
She was, therefore, able to make some interesting changes to traditional Malay choreography. Some dances had always used items like fans and umbrellas, but she began to feature more unusual props like trays, drums and betel boxes. She also used the dances to tell old Malay legends, such as the tale of how ancient Singapore was attacked by swordfish.
While she still loved the old Malay folk dances, she knew they had originated in Malaysia or Indonesia. She wanted to create new works that reflected her Singaporean surroundings. She found plenty of ideas simply by attending weddings. Each weekend, she carefully observed the movements in the ceremonies and people's interactions, and incorporated all that into her dances.
Dancing for Singapore
From 1970 onwards, she was also a dancer in the National Dance Company, a new troupe set up by the government that included people trained in Chinese, Malay and Indian dance. The company was trying to create a new dance tradition that would reflect the cultures of all three major races in Singapore.
Madam Som was doubtful about the project. â€œI wondered, why are we rehearsing so hard? Why do I have to learn Indian dance and Chinese dance? What are we going to present?â€
Then, in 1972, the company performed at the Adelaide Festival in Australia. To her surprise, audiences loved the show. This proved that a young, multiracial nation like Singapore could develop a culture of its own. Madam Som was so moved that she later named her son â€œAdelâ€, after the festival.
Sadly, the National Dance Company closed down in 1985 due to lack of funds. But, its spirit still lives on in the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Dance Ensemble. This is a multicultural dance troupe for kids, run by Madam Som and her fellow dancers Yan Choong Lian and Neila Sathyalingam.
She trains students in Malay dance, while Madam Yan and Madam Neila train them in Chinese and Indian dance. â€œInstead of just Malay heritage, this is Singaporean heritage,â€ she says.
Traditions add to identity
Since 1997, Madam Som has been the Artistic Director of her own company, Sri Warisan. It has been called Singapore's first professional Malay dance company because it pays its performers a proper salary. (Madam Som had previously earned money by running a bridal boutique, while rehearsing her dances at night.)
The truth is, Sri Warisan focuses on more than just dance. It promotes all kinds of traditional Malay performing arts, including angklung music, bangsawan opera and wayang kulit puppetry. Last year, its dancers participated in festivals in Qatar, Poland and Guam, while its puppeteers travelled to Spain, Russia, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar and Vietnam. They also ran arts education programmes in 122 different Singapore schools!
However, now that she is 66 years old, Madam Som rarely dances. She still teaches classes, and serves as a judge for the Singapore Youth Festival. But, she spends most of her time researching the history of Malay dance in Singapore, so that she can write a book about the subject. â€œIt's a new step for me, to share, to write about why we dance,â€ she says.
She feels optimistic about the future of Malay dance. Although it has changed in many ways, its foundations are strong, and it remains closely connected to the folk dances she learned as a girl.
In the same way, she believes Singaporeans can move forward while holding on to their â€œjati diriâ€, or identity. To her, tradition is not a burden. It is an inspiration.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-john-miksic/story,"In the early 1980s, the Singapore government was making plans to develop Fort Canning Hill. They wanted to turn it into a centre for entertainment and culture, with an underground car park for 300 vehicles.
But, some employees of the National Museum (present-day National Museum of Singapore) were unsure about this. They knew that there were legends that a palace had stood on the hill in the 14th century. In January 1984, they invited an archaeologist to investigate the site for any traces of Singapore's ancient past.
The archaeologist's name was Dr John Miksic. He still remembers the trip vividly. â€œWe had ten days,â€ he says. â€œI had three groups of workers: museum staff, hired Indian labourers, and some national servicemen who were being punished. I was not sure what kind of cooperation I was going to get from them, but once I explained what we were doing, they got very interested.â€
At first, his team found only the skeleton of a goat, an old British army helmet, and a few bricks from the 19th or 20th century. To make matters worse, it rained heavily. Every day, he would go back to his hotel with his shoes covered in mud.
The team started digging near the Keramat Iskandar Shah, a shrine which is said to mark the tomb of the last king of Singapore. â€œSuddenly we saw the soil colour change and we started finding different kinds of artefacts,â€ Dr Miksic says. Among these items were pieces of blue and white Chinese porcelain, made during the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368). This meant that the site dated back to at least the 1300s.
It was a landmark moment. The team had found evidence that a 14th century settlement really had existed on Fort Canning Hill. In response, the government agreed to change its development plans. They knew that the remains of ancient Singapore were far too precious to be disturbed.
Fascination with history
Dr Miksic was born in the USA in 1946. He grew up on a farm in western New York. Sometimes, he would find old Native American stone arrowheads on the ground, which made him wonder about life in the past. This fascination with history led him to become an archaeologist.
Since then, he has carried out digs in many different countries, including Canada, Honduras, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia. However, most of his work has taken place in Singapore, where he still lives today.
Over the years, he has found some remarkable treasures in our soil. For instance, he uncovered pieces of a Chinese porcelain bowl, which was once used as a compass. Sailors would have filled the bowl with water, and then floated a magnet on the water's surface. The free-floating magnet would naturally point north. This is the world's only surviving example of a compass like this.
Another strange artefact is a tiny statue of a headless man on a winged horse. It is made of lead. As far as we know, the metal lead was not used in statues in ancient Southeast Asia. He is still deeply puzzled about how it came to be in Singapore. He thinks it may represent Raja Chulan, an Indian king who was said to be the father of Sang Nila Utama.
As an archaeologist, he does not rely solely on buried objects to get information about the past. He searches for historical documents from all over the world â€“ such as writings by European traders, Chinese explorers and Javanese historians â€“ to build up a picture of what ancient Singapore was like.
Great contributions
â€œLife in 14th century Singapore was a lot like modern life,â€ he explains. The population was multiracial, including Malays, Chinese, Indians and Orang Laut. They worked a variety of jobs, such as fishing, winemaking, saltmaking and working with metal. They mostly seem to have lived in a small area, inside a walled city. There would probably have been trees within these walls, meaning that we were already a garden city in ancient times!
The rulers of Singapore had to worry about keeping peace with larger neighbouring kingdoms in Java and Siam, which attacked Singapore on different occasions. The rulers also reached out to China; there are records that they gave gifts of tribute to the Chinese Emperor and commanded their subjects not to attack Chinese traders. However, we mostly enjoyed good trading relations. This may explain why the remains of trade goods from all over Asia have been discovered in our soil.
Clearly, Dr Miksic has made huge contributions to our knowledge of Singapore's ancient past. Yet, if you ask him what his greatest accomplishment is, he will not talk about his discoveries. Instead, he will describe his work as a teacher. He has trained young Southeast Asians in archaeology so they can learn more about their own cultures.
â€œOne of them is the head of the Anthropology Department of Indonesia,â€ he says. â€œOne of them just became the Head of the Economic and Social Commission for the AsiaPacific in Bangkok.â€ His Singaporean students include Goh Geok Yian. She is developing a digital Database for archaeological remains from the Singapore Cricket Club and is also an expert in Burmese history.
Dr Miksic is delighted that more and more Singaporeans are starting to become aware of our ancient past. Not only does this give us a deeper understanding of history; it also gives us a lot of pride as a nation. â€œWe were not just a minor fishing village,â€ he reminds us. â€œWe were actually an important place.â€

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/hazel-locke/story,"When Hazel Locke was a girl, her father often told her stories about his aunt, Agnes Joaquim (1854-1899). She was an Armenian Singaporean woman who created the famous Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid. 
Hazel Locke with a picture of her great-aunt, Agnes Joaquim and the trophy awarded by the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO). Ms Joaquim was inducted into the SCWO Hall of Fame in 2015.
Every day, he would pick Hazel up from Raffles Girls' School, which was then located in the city centre. Together, they would walk past the flower shops on the opposite side of Orchard Road, where the Cold Storage building was and The Centrepoint shopping mall stands today.
He would point to the huge metal tubs, full of Vanda Miss Joaquims, and describe how his aunt had created this flower. She had carefully crossed two different species of orchids: the Vanda hookeriana and the Vanda teres â€”something no-one had managed to do before. â€œHe would cross his two forefingers to stress this point,â€ Mrs Locke says. â€œIt wasn't one time that he did this. It was every time.â€
Her father was very proud of his aunt, and Hazel grew up feeling the same way about her great-aunt. She saw her flowers everywhere. Back then, many Singaporeans grew Vanda Miss Joaquims in their gardens. British soldiers would pack stalks of the orchids into long boxes and send them home as gifts.
National flower
Then, in 1981, the Singapore Tourism Board announced that they had chosen the Vanda Miss Joaquim as our national flower. A ceremony was held to celebrate the decision, and Mrs Locke's uncle was invited to come to Singapore as the oldest surviving member of the Joaquim family.
To her surprise, her uncle told reporters that Ms Joaquim had not created the flower. He claimed she had discovered it in her garden in a clump of bamboo. â€œI slunk down in my seat,â€ Mrs Locke says. â€œI wanted to say, â€˜Uncle Basil, this is not what my father told me.'â€ 
She knew her father was right. After all, her uncle had not even been born when Ms Joaquim took her plant to the Singapore Botanic Garden to show it to Henry N. Ridley, the director. But, she did not speak up as she did not want to disrespect her uncle. As a result, the sceptics believed that her great-aunt had merely found the flower by chance.
The real story
Over the next few decades, Mrs Locke gathered more information about Agnes Joaquim. She shared her research with historians, hoping that they could correct the misconceptions about her great-aunt.
Agnes Joaquim (1854 - 1899)
One of the documents she found was an article from a magazine, written in 1893 by Mr. Ridley. It clearly stated that Ms Joaquim had created the orchid through cross-breeding. It also said she was a well-known and award-winning horticulturalist â€” a person who uses scientific knowledge to grow plants.
Mrs Locke's daughter, Linda Locke, built on her mother's research by doing her own extensive investigations, along with that of Nadia Wright and Harold Johnson. As a result of these efforts, in 2016, the National Parks Board and National Heritage Board changed their official records to reflect accurately Agnes Joaquim's achievement. As a 19th century Singaporean woman, she used her intelligence, perseverance and skill to develop a flower that is still loved by millions of people today.
Remarkable family
Agnes Joaquim is not the only remarkable member of Mrs Locke's family. â€œMy great uncle Joe Joaquim (1856-1902), a brother of Agnes, was an eminent lawyer and acclaimed criminal barrister. He was also Grand Master of the Singapore Masonic lodge,â€ explained Mrs Locke.
Joe Joaquim (1856-1902)
Her paternal grandfather, Eleazar Johannes (1854-1921), was an Armenian immigrant from Iran. He managed grand hotels like the Adelphi Hotel and the Sea View Hotel. (Quite a few Armenians were hotel managers, such as the Sarkies Brothers, who founded Raffles Hotel.)
Her mother's side of rel=""noopener noreferrer"" the family was Portuguese; she is descended from Sir Jose D'Almeida (1784 â€“ 1850), one of the early European settlers here. Originally a ship's surgeon, he set up a trading firm and plantation. Although he was a very successful merchant, he still practiced as a doctor and opened a medical centre to help those in need. If you visit Raffles Place, you can still see a road named after him: D'Almeida Street.
Sir Jose D'Almeida (1784 â€“ 1850)
When Mrs Locke was born in 1923, her family was quite rich. They had a car, which was a luxury in those days, and four maids: three Cantonese and one Malay. â€œMy mother was spending money like there was no tomorrow!â€ she laughs. She still remembers enjoying Mickey Mouse cartoons at Capitol Cinema on weekend mornings.
Hard times
Sadly, her parents lost their fortune. For a while, her father managed an amusement park, but he eventually ended up unemployed. When she finished school, she had to turn down a university scholarship because she had to earn money. She worked as a dentist's assistant, then as a telephone operator at Cold Storage Supermarket.
Mrs Locke has vivid memories of World War II. When the war reached Singapore, the family was reluctant to leave. But, as the battle for Singapore intensified, her father made a last-minute decision to arrange for his wife, daughters and youngest son to take refuge in India. 
Now, Mrs Locke is almost 94 years old. She lives near her daughter Linda, and is still alert and healthy. But, when she goes out, she is confused by all the new buildings and landmarks. â€œI know the street names, but I don't know where I am,â€ she complains.
Nevertheless, she hopes she can contribute by sharing her memories with researchers. She can tell many tales about old Singapore, and how her family played an important part in our history.

Recent research identified the genus of these two parent orchids as Papilionanthe, instead of Vanda. As their scientific names are now Papilionanthe teres and Papilionanthe hookeriana, the national flower has been renamed Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim. Its common name remains Vanda Miss Joaquim.

â€œTINTIN BROUGHT ME HAPPINESS. I DID MY BEST AT WHAT I WAS DOING AND IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY. BUT I HAD A LOT OF FUN. MOREOVER... I GOT PAID FOR DOING IT...â€
â€” HergÃ©, 30 December 1975 â€”
From 5 November 2011 to 31 May 2012, the Singapore Philatelic Museum (SPM) celebrated one of the most beloved comic characters worldwide, the boy reporter Tintin. Created by Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (1907-1983) â€“ also known as HergÃ©, Tintin is a teenage journalist who began a series of exciting adventures in 1929, accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy; and later his faithful friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus.
Tintin's adventures, which spanned 24 comic books, took the young reporter and Snowy to various places around the world. They ventured into India, Tibet and China in Asia; to the Congo in Africa; Arabia in the Middle East; Russia in Europe; North and South America; and even the Moon!
Shown in this exhibition were stamps from SPM's permanent collection. Also on display were a wide range of Tintin collectibles and rarely seen original stamp artworks on loan from the Museum Voor Communicatie in the Netherlands and L'Adresse MusÃ©e de La Poste in France.
HergÃ© â€“ Creator of Tintin
It is difficult to separate HergÃ©'s life from his work. As a child, his sketches lined the margins of his exercise books. During his teenage years, he was always with his sketchbook, and his adult life was spent eternally stuck to his drawing board.
His fictional creation was part of him, living within him and playing key roles in his life. His life influenced his creation, and his creation influenced his life.
From youth to adulthood, HergÃ© drew alone, with the occasional one-off collaborations. His was the work of a master craftsman, and it came from his heart and his technical expertise. But when HergÃ© reached the age of 40, he began to favour working within a team and set up Studios HergÃ© in 1950.
HergÃ©'s studio allowed many talented artists to flourish and develop their own work. It became an institution dedicated to the conservation and exhibition of the clear line style. HergÃ© was the artistic director of Tintin magazine and the managing director of Studios HergÃ©. But he was more of a mentor than the boss of a company.
Scout's Honour
In 1921, the young HergÃ© joined the Saint-Boniface College scout group. He was given the nickname â€˜Curious Fox'.
â€œIt was with scouting that the world really began to open up in front of me. It's the greatest memory of my youth. Being close to nature, respecting nature, resourcefulness. It was all very important to me and even if it all seems a bit old-fashioned today, I still hold dear the values we learned.â€
â€“ HergÃ©, 1974
The budding artist was always with his sketchbook and pencil, sketching scenes of daily scout-life, landscapes from his travels and life portraits. The teenager quickly built up a good reputation for drawing such subjects.
â€¢ name: Georges Remi
â€¢ date of birth: 22 May 1907
â€¢ died: 3 March 1983 (age 75)
â€¢ nationality: Belgian
â€¢ father: Alexis Remi (1882 -1970)
â€¢ mother: Elisabeth Dufour (1882 â€“ 1946)
â€¢ sibling: Paul Remi
â€¢ spouse: First Wife â€“ Germaine Kieckens, secretary of Father Wallez, director of Le VingtiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle. Married in 1932, separated in 1960, and divorced in 1977.
â€¢ spouse: Second Wife â€“ Fanny Vlamynck, colourist by profession. Married in 1977.
â€¢ children: None
â€œAs I was a boy scout, I started telling the story of a little boy scout to other little boy scouts...these were not yet real comic strips. They were more like stories with illustrations and from time to time, a shy little exclamation mark or question markâ€
HergÃ©, 1975
The scout's honour he so strongly embraced put him through traumatic nightmares when he was working on Tintin in Tibet. During this time, he suffered from dreams of a white monster that represented the personal conflict he had over whether he should divorce his wife of three decades to be with a 22-year-old employee.
His journey began
After completing his studies in 1925, HergÃ© worked in the subscriptions department of the Belgian newspaper Le VingtiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle (â€˜The Twentieth Century').
He was talent spotted by Father Norbert Wallez, director of Le VingtiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle. Noting HergÃ©'s abilities in lettering and illustration, Father Wallez entrusted the young man with his first graphic design assignment, such as the designing of headings, layout of newspaper columns and creation of dropped initials, tailpieces and illustrations.
Three years later, HergÃ© was given his first real responsibility as an illustrator when he became the editor of Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me (â€˜The Little Twentieth '), the children's supplement to Le VingtiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle. The first issue was published on November 1 that year.
His creations
HergÃ©'s first drawings appeared in 1921 in Jamais assez, a scout magazine for schools; and then in Le Boy-Scout Belge, the monthly magazine of the Belgian scouts.
From 1924 onwards, he signed his drawings as HergÃ©, a phonetic transcription of his initials G.R. in the reverse (pronounced as â€˜Air-Zhay' in French).
He created Totor, Patrol Leader of the May Bugs, in Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. On 10 January 1929, Tintin and Snowy made their debut in Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me. In 1930, HergÃ© introduced Quick and Flupke, street urchins from the backstreets of Brussels who starred in short stories in Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was published by Editions du Petit VingtiÃ¨me in the same year.
Cinema in a comic strip
HergÃ©'s work drew inspiration from the art of film-making. The plots, atmosphere and framing that constituted his picture stories were all heavily influenced by cinematic style. This led to his adventures, recorded in mere ink on paper, turning out to be as animated and expressive as full-length features shown in the cinema.
HergÃ© treated his characters as actors and he used current events and from history for his scenes. In this way, his frames and speech bubbles speak directly to us.
â€œI operate just like a film director. Firstly, there's the scenario. In principle, I'm the scriptwriter as well ... It's true that it's very similar to the cinema. Then there's the directing. The artist needs to be an actor and director simultaneously, and a draughtsman as well. He directs the actors. He has to feel when a character in a particular situation needs to run to the left or right or elsewhere. The artist also writes the dialogues, except in cases where there is a team with a scriptwriter and artist. In my case, I have to be everything at once.â€
â€“ HergÃ©, 1971
Man of letters
HergÃ© was a prolific writer. He was as demanding of his writing as he was of his drawing and painting. He left behind approximately 40,000 letters. While the majority were about his work, there were many that touched on love, his emotions and social life.
These writings bear witness to the author's character and taste.
This is an extract of a letter he wrote to a young girl, Anne le B., from Casablanca. She had written to him about her teenage loneliness, thinking that she was writing to HergÃ©'s grandfather!
â€œDear Miss,
In response to your esteemed letter of 20 June, I have the honour of letting you know: that I don't have a beard, yet if I did have one, it would not be white, but just going grey; that as I don't have a beard, my grandchildren can't pull it; that furthermore I'm not a true grandparent as I have neither beard nor grandchildren; that part of the reason I'm not a grandparent may be because I'm not even a father; that I limit myself to having just one wife, because that's the Belgian custom, in contrast to your area, where the custom is to have several; that I don't have anyone who really is the living model for Captain Haddock; that I do generally receive and see the letters I am sent; that if some malevolent force had made your hand disappear, I would have been deprived of this pleasure; and lastly that I am very keen on writing back to you, and here is the proof! Is there still anything else to write? Since you haven't asked me anything, I don't even have the ability to refuse you anything. Basically, you have confided that you don't even have a rat to talk to. If I understand it correctly, you've promoted me to that flattering role. I am clean-shaven (â€˜ras' in French) and I could also be your rat, given that our conversation would be rudimentary and short-lived. It's not only in fairy tales that a hideous beast can be transformed into Prince Charming, in the big round eyes of a 16-year old princess.â€
Tintin's trademarks
Famous Hairstyle
His little blond quiff. This quiff was formed only on pages 7-8 of Tintin in the Land of Soviets when he jumped into a car and raced away. The sudden acceleration gave him the distinctive quiff which became synonymous with Tintin. Since then the little tuft of hair never droops.
Plus-Four Pants
He is always dressed in a plain yellow or white collared shirt, often with a blue sweater over, and his trademark plus-four trousers. But he traded his plus-fours for bellbottoms in Tintin and the Picaros.
Who is Tintin?
  Tintin was definitely born of my unconscious desire to be perfect, to be a hero.
â€“ HergÃ©.
HergÃ© has never confirmed who inspired him to create the Tintin character, and it may never be known who that was. But there are several claims.
Danish actor Palle Huld (1912-2010)
For decades he had claimed that his 44-day round-the-world trip, made in 1928 when he was a 15-year-old scout, was the inspiration to the appearance of Tintin a year later in Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me.
French war and travel photo-journalist Robert Sexe (1890-1986)
Like Tintin, he rode a motorbike and had a best friend called RenÃ© Milhoux (Tintin's dog, Snowy, is called Milou in French). He also toured the Soviet Union, the Congo and America in the same order as Tintin in the first three comic issues.
Paul Remi, HergÃ©'s younger brother (1912-1986)
A military officer, Paul Remi's likeness to the comic character prompted the nickname â€œMajor Tintinâ€ by his colleagues. That led him to shave off his hair and sport a â€˜crew-cut' look. HergÃ© reciprocated by using this new look to create the villainous character Colonel Sponz, who was featured for the first time in The Calculus Affair.
â€œMy childhood companion and playmate was my brother, who was five years younger than me. I watched him, and he amused and fascinated me ... Undoubtedly, this explains how Tintin adopted his character, his gestures, his attitude.â€
â€“ HergÃ©, 1943
Last, but not least Herge&ecute; himself
The creator had claimed â€œTintin, c'est moiâ€ or â€œTintin, it's me.â€ ... â€œThese are my eyes, my meaning, my lungs, my tripe! ... I believe that I am alone in being able to animate, in the sense of giving a soul.â€
Know the cast
HergÃ©'s world was occupied by sharply defined characters. They were mostly inspired by real people who were either close to him, historical figures or celebrities at that time. Their portraits and psychological profiles had been meticulously composed, leaving nothing to chance.
>>Snowy
Tintin's constant companion is an extraordinary white wire fox terrier. He is known as â€œMilouâ€ in French. There are several stories on whom Snowy was named after. One version was that Snowy was named after HergÃ©'s girlfriend Marie-Louise Van Cutsem who was called â€œMalouâ€. Another candidate was RenÃ© Milhoux, the best friend of French war and travel photojournalist Robert Sexe, who was himself one of many speculated inspirations of the Tintin character.
Snowy appeared right at the start, in the first drawing of the first adventure. He sticks by Tintin through good and bad times. He is faithful and courageous, saving Tintin in numerous adventures. He is known to be Tintin's alter ego and his only confidant at the beginning.
>>Captain Archibald Haddock
The arrival of Captain Haddock does in some way replace Snowy. The Captain has always been a bit naÃ¯ve, temperamental, loud, emotional and irritable, but he has a good heart and is always willing to help people who are in trouble.
His first appearance was on pages 14 and 15 of The Crab with the Golden Claws in 1941. He has been a seafaring captain of over 20 years. His ancestor was Knight FranÃ§ois de Hadoque who commanded the frigate, the Unicorn.
Some of Captain Haddock's distinctive features are his sailor outfit of black trousers, sailor's hat and blue pullover with the image of an anchor; and a pipe in his mouth. His favourite exclamations are â€œThundering Typhoons!â€ and â€œBlistering Barnacles!â€
He is courageous but very clumsy, adding much comic relief to the stories. His main weakness is his excessive enjoyment of whisky and rum.
>>Chang Chong-Chen
This character was inspired by a young Chinese student of similar name, >å¼ ä»²ä» (1907- 1998), whom HergÃ© met in 1934 when Chang was studying at the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.
The extremely beneficial relationship inspired both HergÃ©'s professional and spiritual life. This marked a turning point in HergÃ©'s career, and was central to the creation of The Blue Lotus in 1935. Twenty-four years later HergÃ© celebrated his friendship with Chang again in Tintin in Tibet.
â€œI think that Chang was, without knowing it, one of the artists who had the most influence on me. He was a young Chinese student whom I had first met at the time when he helped me to create The Blue Lotus, and it was he who made me aware of the absolute necessity of being well informed about a country and of constructing a narrative.â€
â€“ HergÃ©, 29 April 1977
  Chang returned to China after he completed his studies in 1937. He became the Principal of the Shanghai Fine Arts Academy and was a celebrated sculptor.
The two good friends lost contact when World War Two broke out. The Japanese occupation of China during the war, coupled with the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), separated them for almost three decades. HergÃ©, however, never gave up looking for his friend. His long quest finally paid off in 1975, and they kept in contact through touching letters. It was not for another six years before Chang and HergÃ© had an emotional reunion in Brussels in 1981.
>>Thompson & Thomson
These two clumsy policemen first appeared in Cigars of the Pharaoh in 1932. They were then known as X33 and X33A. Their names were revealed only in King Ottokar's Sceptre in 1939.
The only way to distinguish between the two is from the trim of their moustaches. Thompson's is neatly trimmed, whilst Thomson's has a distinctive twirl at the ends.
Both Thompson and Thomson are not very intelligent, and are incredibly clumsy and confused. They are hence full of blunders, misunderstandings, and always in trouble. One possible inspiration for the characters was HergÃ©â€˜s father, Alexis Remi, and Alexis' twin brother, LÃ©on. They were identical twins; both had moustaches, were dressed alike, wore boater or bowler hats, and held walking canes or umbrellas. Thompson and Thomson, however, are not twins.
HergÃ© could also have been inspired by movies of that time, namely the films of Charlie Chaplin, as well as the comedic duo Laurel and Hardy who shared similarities in characteristics with Thompson and Thomson.
Professor Cuthbert Calculus
He is an absolutely deaf and absent-minded inventor whose French name is Tryphon Tournesol. â€œTryphonâ€ is the name of HergÃ©'s carpenter and â€œTournesolâ€ means sunflower. He was actually modelled after a real person.
â€œPhysically, Calculus and his submarine were based on Professor Auguste Piccard [1884-1962] and his bathyscaphe. He was a scaled down version of Piccard, who was much too tall. Piccard had a very long neck. I would occasionally bump into him in the street and he struck me as the incarnation of a typical scientist. I made Calculus a mini-Piccard, because otherwise I would have needed to enlarge the frames.â€
â€“ HergÃ©
Calculus's deafness was modelled after Paul Eydt, the lawyer at Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me. His deafness was a source of jokes amongst the editorial team.
>>Roberto Rastapopoulos
A dangerous Greek billionaire with the worst morals and taste in clothing, Rastapopoulos is a master of evil and the sworn enemy of Tintin.
His first appearance was in Tintin in America in 1932. He crossed paths with Tintin again in Cigars of the Pharaoh in 1934, The Blue Lotus in 1935, The Red Sea Sharks in 1958, and finally in Flight 714 in 1967.
He was modelled after the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis (1906-1975), who made a fortune constructing super tankers and became legendary for his wealth and display of it.
>>Dr. J.W. MÃ¼ller
Violent and dangerous, enterprising and unscrupulous, and thoroughly evil, Dr MÃ¼ller's personality was based on Dr Georg Bell, a secret agent cum forger and a Nazi troublemaker of Scottish descent.
Physically, Dr MÃ¼ller was based on the British actor Charles Laughton who starred in the film The Island of Doctor Moreau (1933). Laughton played the role of a mad genius, a pioneer of genetic modification and super surgeon, joining animals and humans together to create monstrous hybrids.
Dr MÃ¼ller made his first appearance in The Black Island in 1938 as an outlaw and a master of disguise who often assumed multiple identities.
Celebrating Tintin through stamps
The Adventures of Tintin in 24 Albums
This 2007 stamp collection issued by the Belgium Post features the covers of all 24 titles of the Tintin comic book series, together with a portrait of HergÃ©.
Albums 2 to 9, which were originally in black and white, were republished in colour and in a fixed 62-page format between 1943 and 1947, as well as in 1955. Album 10 was the first to be published in colour right from the beginning. Albums 16 to 23 (and the revised editions of Albums 4, 7 and 15) were published with Studios HergÃ©.
A shortage of paper during World War Two had restricted the comics to 62 pages instead of the 100-130 pages allowed before the war.
The Double-Adventure Sequels
The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure were HergÃ©'s first attempt at dividing Tintin's adventures into two parts.
The double-adventure was such a successful formula that HergÃ© repeated it in four other books. The second double-bill, which came right after Red Rackham's Treasure, spanned The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun. The third double-adventure was told in Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon.
HergÃ© had attempted to create a sequel earlier in 1934 when he embarked on Tintin in the East in Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me. But the resulting work, The Blue Lotus, was more of a companion volume rather than a straight sequel to the preceding book, Cigars of the Pharaoh.
Tintin on the Moon
HergÃ©'s world was filled with science and technology. He was an inquisitive artist who sought out and interviewed numerous scientific experts. The process reached its peak in Tintin's adventure to the Moon.
HergÃ© had the ability to weave complicated scientific subject matters into truly remarkable stories. He drew inspiration from the space race between America and the Soviet Union in the 1950s, keeping close tabs on new developments in rocket science.
To ensure accuracy in his work, HergÃ© made a scale model of the Moon rocket to be featured in Destination Moon, and brought it to Paris for the approval of Professor Alexandre Ananoff, author of L'astronautique. The model could be dismantled to reveal each inner section clearly. Upon his return to Brussels, HergÃ© asked his assistants to draw the iconic red rocket based on his model.
â€œI wanted Bob De Moor [one of HergÃ©'s assistants] ... to know exactly whichever part of the space vehicle the characters were to be found in. It was essential that each detail was in place, that everything was perfectly exact: the venture was too dangerous for me to be involved without guarantee.â€
â€“ HergÃ©
HergÃ© was way ahead of his time. He put Tintin on the Moon in 1953, four years ahead of the Soviet Union which launched the first, unmanned, Sputnik rocket on 4 October 1957. And it was not until two decades later on 20 July 1969 that Neil Armstrong from the United States' Apollo XI mission finally landed and set foot on the Moon. As a fitting outcome to this creative undertaking, Tintin became, in the eyes of many, the first man to walk on the Moon!
â€œThis is it! ... I've walked a few steps! ... For the first time in history of mankind there is an Explorer on the Moon!â€ â€“ Tintin declared in 1953, 16 years before Neil Armstrong' declaration of â€œ one small step for man, one Gian leap for mankindâ€
Tintin comics have been made into movies since 1960, when Tintin first appeared on the big screen in Tintin and the Golden Fleece. This was followed by Tintin and the Blue Oranges in 1964.
In 1969, Belvision Studios in Brussels produced a feature-length animated cartoon based on the book Prisoners of the Sun. In 1976, Moi, Tintin, a full-length documentary about Tintin and his creator, hit the screens.
In October 2011, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, made its debut as a computer animated 3D movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie script was based on three of the comic stories: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure. A new set of stamps was issued by bpost (Belgium Post) on 27 August 2011 to mark this special occasion.
