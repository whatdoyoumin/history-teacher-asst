History is the study of the past. This may include individuals, societies, 
past events and developments, or even places. However, history is not the 
past.

history. Why do you think this is so?

In this unit, we will explore how Singapore’s location within trading networks affected its rise and decline as a 
trading port. We start the story in 1299, tracing Singapore’s rise and decline through the centuries, until the arrival 
of the British in 1819. Embark on a journey to discover how Singapore’s geographical location and reactions to 
events occurring in the wider region contributed to its success or failure as a trading port.

LEARN A SKILL: READING MAPS
A map is a graphical representation of all or part of the world’s surface. It gives a bird’s eye view of the 
world. Reading and understanding maps are important in the study of history. Historians use maps to 
understand how geography influenced developments in history. Let us learn more about how geography 
influenced Singapore’s history by studying the map below.

CASE INVESTIGATION
In the following chapter, you will 
learn about the establishment of a 
British trading post in Singapore in 
1819. You already know that some 
Europeans, such as the Portuguese 
and the Dutch, had been in Southeast 
Asia since the 16th century and that 
their presence grew steadily in the 
following centuries.

HOW DID SINGAPORE BECOME A BRITISH TRADING POST?Interest in the Spice Trade
From the 1400s onwards, spices such as cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg 
from parts of Asia were as valuable as gold in Europe. They were used for 
cooking, medicinal purposes, and were especially useful for preserving food 
as refrigeration and artificial preservatives had not yet been developed.

The British decided to make Singapore a free port. This 
meant that fees were not collected from ships entering 
the port; taxes were only imposed on selected products, 
such as opium. Farquhar placed a British official on  
St John’s Island (located to the south of the main island 
of Singapore) to inform passing ships about the new 
settlement and its free port.

experiences of the various groups of people living in Singapore, the challenges they faced and 
their contributions up to the fall of Singapore in 1942.

 Living conditions in a typical shophouse  
in Chinatown, c. 1907
 Living conditions of rickshaw pullers and labourers in a shophouse, c. 1941One reason for the high death rate was the overcrowded and unhygienic 
living conditions of the poor in the town area. Due to the availability of jobs 
there, many of the workers preferred to stay in shophouses in the town 
area. However, these shophouses were often overcrowded, unsanitary and 
poorly ventilated. This gave rise to the spread of highly contagious diseases 
such as tuberculosis and cholera, which affected many of these workers.

Impact of the Great Depression on Singapore
Singapore was hit particularly hard as its economy depended largely on 
overseas trade, especially the export of Malayan tin and rubber to the 
United States market. Prior to the Great Depression, prices of tin and 
rubber were very high.

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)
Towards the end of the 1930s, the international situation deteriorated drastically. Large-scale conflict broke out 
both in Europe and in Asia.

The worsening situation in Europe and the Asia Pacific during the 1930s meant the British had to make some 
difficult choices. They had to weigh the defence of the British homeland against the defence of its widespread 
overseas empire. Ultimately, defending Britain itself was more important. As we shall see later, this decision 
had an impact on British plans for defending Malaya and Singapore, and the actual forces available to resist the 
Japanese invasion. Southeast Asia was a possible solution to 
Japan’s problems.

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)
Most of the troops sent to Malaya and Singapore were poorly trained 
and ill-equipped. There were no tanks and very few anti-tank weapons, 
because the British thought tanks were unsuitable for the jungle.

Japanese Plans and Strategies
Japanese Preparations for Invasion
Even before the outbreak of World War II, Japan had made preparations 
for a potential invasion of Malaya and Singapore. Japanese spies disguised 
as tourists or barbers helped to gather information for the military. The 
Japanese army also set up a special research unit to look into techniques 
for jungle fighting and the training of soldiers for the invasion of Malaya. A 
pamphlet on useful tips was written for these soldiers to read before the 
invasion (see Source 5).

Fierce 
fighting took place here. Armed only with 
swords, grenades and small rifles, Chinese 
volunteers fought bravely alongside the 
defending forces. The Japanese later took 
revenge by killing all the Chinese men, 
women and children in the nearby village.6

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)Here are some factors that contributed to the fall of Singapore. Based 
on what you have learnt in this chapter, group them into the following 
categories:
• international context;
• historical actors; and
• local circumstances.

Many of the causes which contributed to our defeat in Malaya and Singapore had a common origin, namely the  
British Empire’s lack of readiness for war. Our shortage in ships, aircraft and tanks, the inexperience of our leaders, and 
the lack of training of our troops, can all be attributed to a failure to prepare for war. In 1941, when the crisis came, it was 
too late to put things right. By that time, we were engaged in a life and death struggle in the West, and war material which 
might have saved Singapore was sent elsewhere. The choice was made and Singapore had to suffer.

3In this unit, we will study how the fall of Singapore to Japanese forces in 1942 marked the start 
of a turbulent period in Singapore’s history. The hardships and sufferings during the Japanese 
Occupation changed the people’s attitudes towards British rule. Following the British return, 
unrest grew as people in Singapore began to question British rule and desire control over 
their own destinies.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 11) ---
Wider global developments, especially the Cold War, influenced people’s 
sentiments and the decisions and actions of the British. Decolonisation in other parts of Asia 
also spurred the people in Malaya and Singapore to fight for independence from the British.Singapore’s Struggle for Independence (1942–1965)UNIT

BE A YOUNG HISTORIAN: DIVERSITY

As you learnt in Chapter 4, when historians study the past, they look 
at diverse and sometimes opposing perspectives. They recognise that 
people might have had different experiences even though they lived in 
the same place during the same time.

Cultivating the Japanese Spirit
The introduction of the Japanese language went hand in hand with the 
promotion of Nippon seishin (Japanese spirit) to foster a sense of loyalty 
and identity. During morning assembly in schools, students had to sing 
“Kimigayo” , the Japanese national anthem, and bow before the picture of 
the Japanese Emperor before the day began. They were also taught to sing 
Japanese folk songs.

 POW in Changi Prison, 1945Disease and Death
Healthcare and sanitation, which had hardly been a priority of the colonial 
authorities before the outbreak of war, worsened during the Japanese 
Occupation. Furthermore, the local population was weakened by food 
shortages.

We have to work long 
hours and are not given enough to eat. We even have to 
plant our own vegetables and add talcum powder to our 
rice porridge in order to have a fuller meal.Experience 2:  Leisure and Entertainment

Dear Diary, 
On certain days, we try to keep our spirits high by 
organising activities and events. Sometimes we have the 
opportunity to attend plays and variety shows. Some 
of my fellow prisoners are so talented at theatrical 
performances! We also smuggle in paints and brushes for 
painting on the walls of the chapel. In tough times, we 
do all that we can to keep sane and make the hardship 
more bearable. If only we could be liberated …Diary of Private Joseph Chapman

One of the priorities of the Japanese was to remove all traces of Western colonial influence and to firmly 
establish Japanese authority over the locals. In addition to using force to ensure the submission of the 
locals, the Japanese used propaganda to win over local support for their rule. They used channels such as 
posters, newspaper articles and speeches to communicate their messages. In this Case Investigation, you 
will explore how the Japanese used the various forms of propaganda and examine the messages they sought 
to convey to the locals. What key propaganda messages were used by the Japanese to  
convince the locals to support their rule during the Japanese Occupation?CASE INVESTIGATION
We ... hope that we sweep away the arrogant and unrighteous British elements and share pain and rejoicing with all 
concerned peoples in a spirit of “give and take” and also hope to promote the social developments by ... giving all content 
to the respective race and individual according to their talents ...

HOW DID THE PEOPLE IN SINGAPORE RESPOND TO BRITISH RULE AFTER WORLD WAR II?The Japanese Occupation left a deep impression on those who lived 
through it. While happy cries greeted the return of British rule, the people 
in Singapore no longer viewed their colonial masters in the same way 
as before.

Unsatisfactory working conditions, together with the housing and food 
shortages, led to a wave of strikes7 during the post-war period. Thousands 
of workers from various industries took part in these strikes. In 1947 alone, 
known as “The Year of Strikes” , there were over 300 strikes in Singapore, 
involving almost 70,000 workers. Some of these strikes lasted for weeks.

On the evening of 3 June 1959, a crowd of 50,000 assembled at the Padang 
in front of City Hall. They greeted the start of Singapore’s internal self-
government with loud cheers. Speaking from a rostrum on the steps of 
City Hall, PAP leader Lee Kuan Yew rallied the people, sounding a message 
of unity and hope: 
Let us work together as a more united people towards 
a brighter and a better future. May the next five years 
be happy, peaceful and prosperous years for all of us!

Recall the events that occurred on Singapore’s road to full internal self-government. What happened at each 
event? What role did each event play in Singapore’s progress towards self-government? In the corresponding 
boxes below, write down what you know about each event and your reflections about them. An example 
has been done for you.LET’S REVIEW
Full Internal Self-Government (1959)• This was the first time locals had the 
chance to vote for people to represent 
them in the Legislative Council.

Although Singapore did not achieve full independence in 1959, that year has long been regarded by many 
in Singapore as a significant one. Scenes of large crowds at the Padang celebrating the formation of the PAP 
government, victorious at the 1959 election, remain vividly etched in the minds of many who lived through 
the period. Fifty years later, an article in The Straits Times commemorating the 1959 election indicated that 
the election and its outcome marked the time a “new Singapore came into being”. You looked at the concept 
of historical significance earlier in this chapter (see page 70). Why might the 1959 election be considered a 
significant event in Singapore’s history? Study the sources and answer the questions that follow. In what ways could the 1959 election be considered significant?CASE INVESTIGATION

 Headline in The Sunday Times, 28 May 1961, after 
Tunku Abdul Rahman proposed a union between 
Malaya and Singapore and the creation of a new 
federation
 Tunku Abdul Rahman with Prime Minister Lee Kuan 
Yew, 16 November 1961
 Cartoon in The Straits Times showing Prime 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Tunku Abdul Rahman 
making plans for a merger between Singapore and 
Malaya, 29 July 1961With Ong’s win, it seemed to the Tunku that the moderate group was 
losing its influence in the PAP. This increased his fear that the radical group 
would gain control of the party.

The Barisan Sosialis, weakened by the arrests of its leaders during Operation

37 out of 51 seats, while the Barisan Sosialis managed to win only 13 seats.70.8% OPTION A
I support merger giving Singapore 
autonomy in labour, education and 
other agreed matters as set out in 
Command Paper No. 33 of 1961, with 
Singapore citizens automatically 
becoming citizens of Malaysia.*
* Prime Minister Lee renegotiated the 
status of Singapore citizens in the 
Federation with the Tunku to prevent the 
Barisan Sosialis from using citizenship 
issues to oppose merger. Thereafter, 
in August 1962, he announced that 
the Tunku accepted that all Singapore 
citizens would become “Malaysian 
citizens” after the merger, but were 
only allowed to vote in elections for 
Singapore’s legislative body.1.7% OPTION B

• Agreed to join Malaysia after 
findings from the Cobbold 
Commission* (1962) indicated 
that two-thirds of the people 
in North Borneo and Sarawak 
wanted to join Malaysia
* The Cobbold Commission was set 
up in January 1962 to inquire about 
the views of the people of North 
Borneo and Sarawak towards the 
formation of Malaysia.

BE A YOUNG HISTORIAN: CAUSATION
Amy Lim
Amy Lim
In Chapter 5, you learnt how three types of factors – context, 
circumstances and the actions of historical actors – interact to 
contribute to a historical event or outcome. In examining causation, 
remember that the actions of historical actors can have unintended 
consequences.

After the riots, Goodwill Committees, comprising 
community leaders from the various racial groups,  
were formed to calm tensions and restore 
harmonious relations among the different races.However, tensions did not disappear. About 
six weeks later, riots broke out, triggered by 
the murder of a Malay trishaw rider on  
2 September 1964. An islandwide curfew 
was imposed again.

Singapore’s separation from Malaysia on 9 August 1965 was greeted with 
mixed responses. Many raised concerns over Singapore’s ability to survive 
on its own.

In this unit, we will examine Singapore’s status as an independent nation-state – a status that  
was not easily attained or expected, by many of its leaders and its people. Little more than a city, 
Singapore had to survive in a global and regional environment that was fraught with challenges 
during that period.

At first, NS was received with some anxiety and uncertainty by many young 
men and their families. Men, especially those from less well-to-do families, 
were expected to find a job quickly upon leaving school and contribute 
to the household income. But with NS, their entry into the workforce 
would be delayed and their families would lose the income they could 
have earned.

to the Istana in Singapore, 24 October 1967Strengthening Relations with the World 
Establishing Diplomatic Relations with Other Countries
Besides pursuing military cooperation, Singapore also developed 
diplomatic relations with countries around the world. This was important 
as it could not take for granted that other countries would recognise its 
independence.

Singapore also sought to improve ties with countries it had tensions with, 
such as Indonesia. Earlier you learnt about Indonesia’s policy of Konfrontasi 
and how bilateral ties were further strained after Singapore executed 
the Indonesian soldiers who had carried out the bombing of MacDonald 
House in 1968. Tensions between both countries eased only in 1973 when 
Prime Minister Lee visited Jakarta and scattered flowers on the graves of 
the two soldiers, allowing both countries to move on from the incident.

Conclusion
 SAF soldiers marching in front of the National 
Theatre (building in the background, demolished  
in 1986) at River Valley on National Day, 1968After independence in 1965, Singapore faced various security challenges 
from the region and internally. To overcome these challenges, Singapore 
adopted a two-pronged approach: deterrence and diplomacy.

TO WHAT EXTENT DID PEOPLE’S LIVES CHANGE AFTER INDEPENDENCE?In Chapter 9, you learnt about the security challenges that put Singapore’s 
future as an independent nation-state in doubt. Apart from that, 
Singapore’s survival was also threatened by other challenges that needed 
urgent attention during its early post-independence years.

How Singapore Benefitted from MNCs Setting Up Operations Here
• Employment for thousands of people
• Valuable technical training and work experience for the local workforce, which helped to build up local 
expertise that would eventually fill job vacancies previously filled by foreigners
• Greater access to modern technology to help keep Singapore competitive globally
• Increased exports of locally manufactured goods to more overseas markets
 Figure 10.1: Why MNCs were attracted to Singapore and their importance to the economy
To lower costs and maximise profitsLower tax rates, which made it more 
financially attractive for MNCs to set up 
operations in new industries in Singapore
To operate in a safe and secure 
environmentSafe and secure environment due to 
low crime rates, strengthened defence 
capabilities and diplomatic relations with 
countries across the region and world
To have a reliable supply of labourLarge, young and growing labour force 
supported by trade unions that partnered 
the government and company bosses to 
achieve higher productivity and stronger 
economic growth
To have a suitable location for their 
factories, with facilities and space  
available for future expansionSizeable amount of land set aside for 
the development of industrial estates 
equipped with adequate facilities for 
factories and space for their future 
expansion

4 GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a year. The higher the annual percentage increase 
in GDP, the greater the economic growth.These efforts to diversify the economy paid off, as manufacturing activity 
in Singapore increased significantly (see Figure 10.2 for some of the key 
industries that developed in Singapore). Almost 150,000 jobs were created 
between 1967 and 1973 alone.

To boost connectivity among industries and 
households, the telecommunications system 
was improved. The Singapore Telephone 
Board installed new telephones at a rapid 
pace. While it had taken 85 years to install 
the first 100,000 telephones, it took just 
five years from 1967 to 1972 to double the 
network size to 200,000.Telecommunications
Banking and financial services were 
expanded to meet the needs of MNCs and 
other companies in Singapore. For example, 
the Development Bank of Singapore 
(DBS) was established in 1968 to finance 
industrialisation and other development 
projects. Many foreign banks also set up 
operations here.Banking and Finance
The Public Utilities Board (PUB) was set 
up in 1963. It was responsible for providing 
public utilities such as water, electricity 
and gas to industries and households.

It continued its work after Singapore’s 
independence. This improved both the 
operating conditions of industries and 
people’s living conditions. Public Utilities

Paya Lebar Airport was expanded in the 
1960s and 1970s so it could handle more 
passenger and cargo traffic. However, there 
was insufficient space for future expansion.

For most of the new HDB residents, the flats were a significant change 
from their previous homes. For the first time, they had access to amenities 
such as electricity, drinkable tap water, waste disposal services and toilet 
facilities in their own homes. They now lived in far greater comfort and 
security. The newly built estates were located in areas such as Queenstown 
and Toa Payoh, which were further from the city. This helped to reduce the 
overcrowding in central areas such as Chinatown. However, not everyone 
responded positively to being rehoused.

having its own facilities such as hawker centres, wet markets, shops and playgrounds.

Up to the 1950s, many women in Singapore did not 
have the chance to go to school or work. They were 
often expected to focus on their traditional roles as 
wives and mothers, while men had the opportunity to 
receive an education and were the main breadwinner.

 Male and female workers at a factory manufacturing typewriters in Bedok, 1974
In 1970, Madam Chan Choy Siong stepped down from her Anson parliamentary seat to make way for new blood. We’ve had 
no female Members of Parliament since.* … The pool of women who meet the … requirements is small, and the number 
of women in that pool willing to consider a political career is much, much smaller. Singapore women are rapidly climbing 
the job ladder, moving confidently into … management positions, showing that gender is, in most cases, an … obstacle 
only in [people’s] minds. More and more, … women are running key departments if not entire organisations.
