Preface
You are about to embark on an exciting journey through the past! Far from being just fun facts and dates, history 
is alive and all around us. Look around you and the Singapore you are living in today – you can find traces of the 
past in buildings, places, names and even objects. The study of history allows us to make sense of the past and draw 
connections to the present. Have you ever wondered how Singapore came to be? This book takes you on a journey to uncover Singapore’s development over the centuries. You will read stories and 
examine historical sources that provide clues to answering questions about Singapore’s past. Start with From Temasek to Singapore (1299–Early 1800s) and trace Singapore’s connections to India, China, the 
Southeast Asian region and beyond from as early as 1299. Find out how Singapore was part of the key trading 
networks even before the arrival of the British. Your journey continues with Singapore’s Development as a Port City Under the British (1819–1942). Here, you will 
examine how British rule and external developments shaped Singapore in various ways. During this period, many 
different groups of people from the region and beyond also came to live and work in Singapore. Learn about their 
experiences, the challenges they faced and their contributions up to the fall of Singapore in 1942. When you move on to Secondary 2, you will proceed to study Singapore’s Struggle for Independence (1942–1965). You will explore how key developments from the 1940s to the 1960s shifted Singapore from a British colony to an 
independent country. As you learn more about Singapore’s road to independence, you will discover how this was 
influenced by post-war global and regional forces, and individuals during this period. The journey comes to a rest with Surviving as an Independent Nation-State (1965–Late 1970s). Here, you will find 
out how a sense of belonging, reality and hope was fostered as Singapore navigated the challenges of being a newly 
independent nation-state during this time. In this journey, various features in this coursebook will guide you in making sense of Singapore’s history. Through 
your study, you will develop greater awareness and curiosity about the past and its relationship to the present.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 4) ---
The 
knowledge and skills you acquire will enable you to be open to multiple perspectives and empathise with people 
from diverse backgrounds.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 5) ---
These will stand you in good stead, not just academically, but also in your everyday life. Singapore’s history does not just end here. Your experiences and stories will one day become part of it as time 
passes. Knowing history puts you in a better position to make decisions that will shape the future. Finally, have an enriching and exciting journey ahead as you learn about Singapore’s rich history!

66 FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)Today, Raffles’ name can be seen all over Singapore: Raffles Place MRT station and Raffles Boulevard, just 
to give a few examples. This is because Raffles is often recognised as the founder of Singapore. However, 
not everyone takes this view. Given what you have learnt about the contributions of Raffles, Farquhar and Crawfurd to the development 
of Singapore, who do you think founded Singapore? Before answering this question, think about what it 
means to be a founder. What does it mean to found a place? Some maintain that Raffles was the founder as he signed the 1819 Treaty that allowed the British to 
set up a trading post in the southern part of Singapore. Others argue that Farquhar was the founder of 
Singapore as he did the work of building Singapore from scratch. Some may even consider Crawfurd the 
founder as he signed the 1824 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance that gave the British control over the  
whole island. Read the sources that follow and conduct your own investigation into who founded Singapore.Who founded Singapore?CASE INVESTIGATION
SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)In Chapter 2, you learnt that historians often examine the causes of key historical events. This is not always 
a straightforward matter.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 9) ---
Related events do not necessarily take place one after another, and one event 
does not always lead to another. To really understand how a historical event came about, historians have to 
examine the possible causes from different angles. One useful way is to look at them in terms of:
• the broader context or setting (e.g., physical, political, economic, social, cultural, military) in which  
the event took place;
• the immediate or local circumstances of the event (e.g., whether people were unhappy or prepared to 
act, the weather on the day of the event); and
• the roles of key historical actors (individuals who made major decisions that contributed to the historical 
event). Besides looking at causes separately, it is also useful to look at how different causes might have interacted 
with one another. Keep this in mind as you read about the fall of Singapore during World War II in  
this chapter. Historical Actors

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)
From the 17th to mid-19th centuries, 
Japan had kept to itself.To do this, the Japanese set out to build their own 
empire in Asia, which would give them the land and 
resources they needed. This would eventually bring Japan into 
conflict with Britain and the United States.Foreigners were banned, except at a few trading ports. The Japanese realised that they had 
fallen far behind the Western countries.Everything changed in 1853, when warships from the 
United States arrived. The United States wanted Japan 
to open more ports and increase trade between them. To catch up, Japan had to change. In less than 50 years, Japan became a modern, industrialised country.However, being a mountainous and heavily forested 
country, Japan lacked natural resources of its own.At the same time, Japan had ambitions 
of becoming a great power. Britain Japan The United States

In addition to the naval base, the British built underground bunkers in secret places all over the island. These bunkers were used 
for defence purposes, such as stores and air-raid shelters. One of the most extensive networks of bunkers lies at Fort Canning,  
where the headquarters of the British forces was located.DID YOU KNOW? The entrance (left) and interior (right) of Battlebox, an underground British military command centre, which is open to the public as part of the Battlebox tour

without damaging them, which 
extended the trees’ productivity and 
lifespan. Known as “Mad Ridley” or 
“Rubber Ridley” , he repeatedly tried 
to interest European and Chinese 
businessmen to cultivate rubber trees 
as an agricultural crop. His promotion 
of rubber coincided with the invention 
of the pneumatic tyre for motor cars. In 1955, just before he passed away, the 
Institution of the Rubber Industry gave 
him its highest award, the Colwyn Medal. ? 1 To monopolise or have monopoly over something means that a company, person or state has complete control over it

What is history to you? Is history simply a collection of stories from the past? A long list of facts and dates to 
remember? What do you know about the history of Singapore? Before we go further, let us start with this simple activity. Do you remember what happened during your first day of school? Write it down on a piece of paper. You could think about how you travelled to school, who you met upon entering school, or the activities 
that you participated in during orientation. When you are ready, share it with your class. Now that you have shared what your first day of school was like, take a closer look at what you have 
written and compare it with a friend’s. What do you notice? It is likely that there are details that your 
friend included that you left out. Why do you think there might be a difference? What made you choose to include some details and 
exclude others, and why is it not possible to include every detail? These are some of the questions that 
you may have when thinking about history and how it is written.

INTRODUCTION

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 21) ---
History is the study of the past. This may include individuals, societies, 
past events and developments, or even places. However, history is not the 
past.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 22) ---
History does not and cannot fully show how it was like in the past. This may not make sense at first, but think back to the earlier activity where 
you wrote about your first day of school. You chose to include certain 
details while leaving out others because it would have been impossible for 
you to feature everything that happened that day. Would another person 
be able to completely know what it was like for you on the first day of 
school? In the same way that you selected events or experiences that you felt were 
most important to you, historians have to make decisions regarding what 
to focus on and how to present it, based on what they feel would best 
represent the past. As historians are also people like you, their perspectives 
are also shaped by their personal experiences. From this, you can see that 
history consists of different accounts carefully constructed by historians.What Is History?

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 23) ---
Types of SourcesHow Is History Constructed? When you recall past events in your everyday life, you do so based on your memories. However, instead of relying 
on their own memories, historians have to rely on clues to construct history. These clues are called sources. When 
you ask good questions about sources, you are able to extract useful evidence from the sources about what the 
past might have been like. The chart below shows the different types of sources historians may use and questions historians may ask to find 
out more about the past. What other questions might you ask? Rickshaw from the late 19th century on display at the National Museum of Singapore. Rickshaws were a form of transportation in colonial Singapore. Chettiar marriage necklace, 19th century
Questions you can ask about sources to find out more about the past: 
• Who produced the source? • When was the source produced?

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 24) ---
• Where was the source produced  
or found? • Why was the source made?• What was the source used for? • What does the source tell you about 
the past? • What is excluded from the source? Artefacts

WHAT IS HISTORY ALL ABOUT?

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 27) ---
Historians need to ensure that the evidence they have is strong enough to make sound conclusions about  
the past. However, it is important to remember that historians make conclusions about the past based on the sources that 
are available to them. It is impossible for historians to completely recover or recreate everything from the past. This means that claims they make about the past may change when new evidence comes to light. The diagram below outlines the steps historians may take to understand more about the past.

In this unit, we will explore how Singapore’s location within trading networks affected its rise and decline as a 
trading port. We start the story in 1299, tracing Singapore’s rise and decline through the centuries, until the arrival 
of the British in 1819. Embark on a journey to discover how Singapore’s geographical location and reactions to 
events occurring in the wider region contributed to its success or failure as a trading port.

Singapore is also a diverse 
society. People from different races, who speak different languages and 
practise different religions, live and work in this country. Have you ever wondered:
• What was Singapore like in the past? • How similar or different was Singapore in the past compared to today? • How did Singapore become what it is today? In 1856, the British official Dr John Crawfurd wrote that there was no record 
of Singapore having been occupied before the British arrived in 1819. It was 
only occasionally used as a hideout by pirates at the time. Was Crawfurd’s 
description of Singapore’s past an accurate one? Had Singapore been just a 
sleepy and unimportant island before 1819? You will learn more about the 
history of early Singapore in this chapter.Chapter at a Glance

BE A YOUNG HISTORIAN: CHRONOLOGY
Chronology refers to the arrangement of past events according to the order in which they took place. Historians place events in chronological order to help them better understand what happened during 
a specific time period in the past.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 43) ---
This can be done by arranging events based on the year in which  
they occurred. Decade
A decade refers to  
a period of 10 years. 1 CE 101 CE 110 CE 501 CE 600 CECentury
A century refers to a period of 100 years. The 6th century CE therefore refers to the years 501–600 CE,  
and the 21st century CE to the years 2001–2100 CE. Millennium
A millennium refers to a period of 1,000 years. The 1st millennium CE therefore refers to the years 1–1000 CE, 
and the 2nd millennium CE to the years 1001–2000 CE.BCE
Years are traditionally numbered with reference to the 
year of the birth of Jesus Christ. Previously, the term 
“BC”, which refers to “Before Christ”, was used. Recently, 
some historians have begun to number years more 
neutrally, without religious references. Hence, the period 
BC is referred to as “Before Common Era” or “BCE”.CE
“CE” is short for “Common Era”. 1 CE is the 
year Christ was born. Previously, the term 
“AD” or “Anno Domini”, which is Latin for “in 
the year of the Lord”, was used. BCE CE1 BCE 2 BCE 3 BCE 1 CE 2 CE 3 CE

Periods
Another way of referring to different times in history is to divide it 
into periods. Periods may be named after significant developments 
that happened then. For example, some historians regard the period 
between 1685 and 1815 for Europe as the Age of Reason or the 
Enlightenment due to the scientific, cultural, philosophical and political 
developments that occurred there during this period.Reigns or Dynasties
One way of referring to different 
times in history is to categorise them 
according to the reigns of individual 
rulers or entire dynasties. For example, 
the Ming dynasty refers to the years  
1368–1644 CE in China, when the country 
was ruled by the Ming emperors, while 
the Victorian era in British history refers 
to the period 1837–1901 CE, when Queen 
Victoria was the ruler of Great Britain. Other Ways of Marking Time
Different calendars are also used to 
organise the year, such as the Chinese 
lunar calendar. Portrait of Emperor Taizu, founder of the  
Ming dynasty, who reigned from 1368 to 1398

How Did Singapore’s Geographical 
Location Affect Its Connections 
with the Region and the World? In our journey to understand our past, it is important to constantly bear 
in mind where Singapore is located. Singapore is part of the region of 
Southeast Asia, which lies to the south of China and east of India. These two large countries were home to old and influential civilisations 
which traded extensively throughout the region and beyond.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 47) ---
For example, 
Chinese goods, such as silk and ceramics, were in demand as far away as 
Europe, while products from Southeast Asia, such as spices, scented wood 
and shells, were highly valuable in China and India. Examples of goods traded between Southeast Asia and the rest of the world Ceramic vase  Silk

During ancient times, the most important trade link between the 
civilisations of Asia, the Middle East and Europe was the network of 
land routes known as the Silk Road. This route connected China through  
Central Asia to the Roman Empire, which controlled much of the Middle 
East and Europe for many centuries. However, this route became less safe for traders due to increased danger 
and difficulties involved in travelling across the Silk Road. They had to rely 
instead on travelling via the maritime route. CHINA

Singapore’s location also allowed it to benefit from the monsoon winds, 
which are seasonal rain-bearing winds. In the days of sailing ships, journeys 
by sea were almost entirely dependent upon wind patterns. The southwest 
monsoons blow from June to September, while the northeast monsoons 
blow from December to March. Map 1.5 below explains how the prevailing 
monsoons determined the course of trade. Map 1.5: Ships leaving China for Southeast  
Asia and the Indian Ocean had to catch the  
northeast monsoon, which would take them  
west. On the other hand, ships departing from  
Indian Ocean ports for China via Southeast  
Asia would have to make use of the southwest 
monsoon. If ships caught the monsoons at the  
right time, the strong winds would allow them  
to complete their voyages quickly.Let us examine the map of Southeast Asia below to understand how the 
island of Singapore was involved in this maritime trade. Countries with economic interests in Asia would place great importance 
on the Straits of Melaka. Control of the Straits would allow them to 
move their ships quickly and safely within and beyond Asia. In different 
historical periods, the Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, British and Japanese 
would attempt to control the Straits to secure maritime routes for their 
ships between the South China Sea 
and Indian Ocean. These attempts 
to control the Straits were a key 
factor in shaping the development 
of Singapore over the centuries.Singapore lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, along a waterway 
known as the Straits of Melaka. Ships sailing from China to India and 
beyond would have to pass through the Straits of Melaka as the quickest 
route to their destinations. This reduced the amount and cost of supplies 
they needed, such as food and water, as well as the risk of pirate attacks 
and accidents. Other routes through the islands further east, in what is 
today’s Indonesia, would take a longer time to complete.The travelling time of sailing ships 
in early times depended on many 
factors. While longer distances 
generally meant a longer travelling 
time, other factors also affected how 
long it would take to get from port 
to port. For example, ships had to 
wait for favourable wind and weather 
conditions before setting sail. They 
might even have had to stop at other 
ports along the way to replenish 
supplies or take shelter during a storm.DID YOU KNOW? What problems did sea 
travellers in the past face? Would sea travellers face the

The story of Sang Nila Utama, also known as Sri Tri Buana, comes from a 17th-century text known as the Sejarah Melayu (Malay 
Annals). It tells the story of a prince who left Palembang for an island to the north. When he arrived at the island called Temasek, 
he spotted a lion. This is an adapted passage from the Sejarah Melayu that describes this event: 
Near the mouth of the river Temasek, Sang Nila Utama and his attendants saw an extremely beautiful animal,  
its body of a red colour, its head black and its breast white, extremely agile and of great strength. Sang Nila Utama 
enquired what animal this was, and was informed that the ancient histories described the singha, or lion, in the  
same manner.

How do we know about early Singapore’s connections with the region 
and the world? Historians use a variety of sources that provide us with information 
about Singapore’s past. Sources can come in many forms. There are:
• textual records, which provide written information about the past;
• archaeological finds, which reveal the nature of economic activities, 
social hierarchies and religions;
• maps, which show us the geographical importance of places; and
• scientific data, which tells us about changes in the environment. Let us see what various sources tell us about early Singapore’s 
connections with the region and the world.BE A YOUNG HISTORIAN: EVIDENCE
This textual source tells 
us about the connections 
between early Singapore 
and China. Using Wang 
Dayuan's text, we can 
conclude that Singapore 
was among the ports 
visited by Chinese traders 
in the 14th century.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 67) ---
Wang Dayuan was a Chinese traveller who visited 
Singapore in the early 14th century. The record of his 
travels, written in 1349, describes communities of 
natives and Chinese living on the island, the agricultural 
activity they conducted, as well as the fact that some 
were pirates. TEXTUAL RECORDS
Pieces of Chinese ceramics were discovered at Empress 
Place, near the Singapore River. These shards came 
from bowls, plates and cups which were produced in 
China during the 13th to 15th centuries.ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDSThese shards indicate that 
Singapore was connected 
to the trade network in the 
region. Different traders 
bought and sold Chinese 
ceramics, which were 
typical trade items. The 
fact that these Chinese 
ceramics were found in 
Singapore suggests that 
there was trade between 
Singapore and the region.LEARN ON THE GO

HOW WAS  
EARLY SINGAPORE  
CONNECTED TO   
THE REGION AND   
THE WORLD?This map shows that 
Singapore was known to 
European travellers in the 
16th and 17th centuries, who 
frequently used the waters 
around Singapore in their 
journeys through the region. Singapore was thus part 
of the trade network that 
connected Europe and Asia 
in this period. Tree rings like these suggest 
changes in climate that 
could have impacted the 
accessibility of maritime 
routes, and caused famine 
and drought in the region, 
e.g., in China. Singapore’s 
trade would have suffered in 
such periods. Manuel Godinho de Erédia was a cartographer, 
or mapmaker, who served the King of Spain. He produced many maps of countries in Asia.

Scientific evidence, such as tree ring records, 
allows us to understand the patterns of wind

drought had taken place.SCIENTIFIC DATA

The prosperity of early Singapore, however, 
did not last. By the middle of the 14th century, 
Singapore had started to decline and would 
soon be overshadowed by a new port city to 
its north: Melaka. One major reason for its decline could have 
been the climatic and economic changes 
that affected the trade with China. Scientific 
evidence shows us that weather patterns 
underwent severe changes in the 14th century. This contributed to droughts and famines in 
China.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 75) ---
As the Chinese economy collapsed 
under this strain, trade between Southeast Asia 
and China would have suffered accordingly. This 
probably reduced one of the major sources of 
early Singapore’s wealth. Like Srivijaya, Singapore also fell prey to 
external threats. As a small island, it was always 
vulnerable to the larger powers in the region. We have already seen how invasions from 
hostile kingdoms brought about the downfall of 
Srivijaya. Similarly, the Kingdoms of Majapahit 
and Ayutthaya (in Thailand) launched attacks 
on Temasek that weakened it by the end of the  
14th century. In c. 1400, the Melaka Sultanate was founded 
along the Straits of Melaka, north of Singapore. The Sultanate became one of the dominant 
trading centres in the region, and soon extended 
control over much of the Malay Peninsula and 
Sumatra. Like Singapore, Melaka was situated 
in a convenient location for traders travelling 
between the Indian Ocean and the South China 
Sea, providing them with a safe harbour during 
their long voyages. See the following page for 
the story of Melaka’s founding.Why Had Singapore Declined

Parameswara’s conversion to Islam and marriage to a Muslim princess from 
Sumatra also attracted Muslim traders to Melaka. Furthermore, Parameswara 
established Melaka’s status as a vassal of China. This meant that it would 
pay tribute2 to the Chinese emperor in return for protection. This gave 
Melaka security from threats posed by rivals in the region. The peace  
that Melaka enjoyed allowed it to grow as a trading centre, attracting 
traders from Sumatra, India and the Middle East. Trade with Europe also 
grew in importance, and this brought European fleets to Southeast Asia  
in greater frequency and numbers. During this period, Singapore was overshadowed by Melaka and ceased 
to serve its previous role as a centre of trade linking the Indian Ocean and  
the South China Sea. However, it was still important to the Melaka 
Sultanate as it was home to the Orang Laut, a seafaring people who were 
the backbone of Melaka’s naval forces. The term “Orang Laut” means “people of the sea” . The Orang Laut lived on 
houseboats and wandered about from place to place, usually in search of good 
fishing grounds where they could catch fish and other sea animals. 17th-century drawing of how the Orang Laut warriors of the Sultan may have looked likeAfter Sultan Muzaffar Shah, the third 
ruler of Melaka, established Islam as 
the official religion of Melaka in the 
middle of the 15th century, Islam 
began to have a significant influence 
on the art of Southeast Asia. For example, prior to the arrival of 
Islam, Southeast Asian woodcarving 
was influenced by Hinduism and 
depicted deities and creatures as 
symbols. However, as Islam forbade

The Arrival of the Europeans
At the beginning of the 16th century, religious, political 
and economic rivalries were intensifying among 
the major powers of Europe. With the voyages of 
discovery in the late 15th century in which European 
sailors opened new maritime routes into Asia and 
other parts of the world, this conflict and competition 
began spreading into Asia. Some famous voyages were those of Christopher 
Columbus, who landed in North America, 
and Vasco da Gama, who established a 
maritime route from Europe to India, 
passing around the Cape of Good Hope 
in the south of Africa (see Map 1.8). This 
route to India was particularly important 
as it allowed Europeans to bypass the 
eastern Mediterranean, which was under 
the control of the Ottoman Turks.

The rivalry between the maritime nations of Spain, Portugal and the 
Netherlands began to focus on Asia as they raced to tap its markets 
and establish trading settlements across the region. Accompanying the 
European presence were many Christian missionaries who ventured into 
India, Southeast Asia and China. From the 16th century onwards, while European influence was growing 
in the region, the Melaka Sultanate was weakened and divided by  
power struggles and internal rivalries. This made the kingdom vulnerable. When the Portuguese decided to take over Melaka, their well-armed 
forces easily conquered the city. With a loyal group of officials and Orang 
Laut warriors, the Sultan fled south. His successor would establish a new 
kingdom along the Johor River, which came to be known as the Johor 
Sultanate. Detail from a 17th-century Dutch painting by

deeply saddened and sent a letter to Java, seeking the 
help of the Majapahit for revenge. The Majapahit forces 
arrived, engaged in battle and subdued Singapore. Iskandar Shah fled from Singapore to Muar (in Johor). In the Suma Oriental, written by a Portuguese traveller 
in the early 16th century, Parameswara is supposed 
to have killed the King of Singapore shortly after  
he arrived on the island. He took control of the island 
and the waters around it. However, the King of Siam, 
who was father-in-law to the King of Singapore, 
decided to attack him. Parameswara did not dare to 
confront him and fled with about a thousand men up the  
Muar River (in Johor).ACCOUNT 1

HOW CONNECTED WAS EARLY SINGAPORE TO THE REGION AND THE WORLD?

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 86) ---
Under the Johor Sultanate, Singapore revived some of its trading functions 
that had been lost during the period of Melaka’s dominance. During this period, several European travellers, such as Tomé Pires,  
Manuel Godinho de Erédia and Jacques de Coutre, wrote about an official 
known by the title of Shahbandar3 based in Singapore. The presence of a 
Shahbandar indicates that Singapore could have been an important trading 
centre for the Johor Sultanate as his duty was to oversee foreign trading 
communities and issue trading licences to foreign traders. At the same time, there is evidence of trade between the Johor 
Sultanate and China during this period. A 17th-century Chinese map 
depicts shipping routes from the main Chinese port of Quanzhou 
to different parts of Asia. One such route is shown leading to Johor.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 87) ---
Archaeological evidence supports this. Chinese porcelain from the 17th 
century found in the Kallang River suggests that items made in China 
were being traded in and around Singapore, and similar porcelain has 
also been uncovered in Johor. Singapore was therefore the gateway for 
a system of trade that passed from China through Singapore and down  
the Johor River.How Important Was Singapore

of a Shahbandar in Singapore. 3 The Shahbandar, or “Lord of the Haven” in Persian, is similar to today’s port master of a harbour. The Shahbandar was a 
representative and official of the Johor Sultanate stationed in Singapore. Appointed by the Johor Sultan, he was in charge 
of managing and controlling a harbour or port in Singapore. He also performed gatekeeping duties, which included meeting 
traders before they proceeded upriver to the capital of the Johor Sultanate. 36

What Caused Singapore to 
Decline Again? ConclusionSingapore declined in importance from the mid-17th century due to 
political changes in the region. After 1610, the Dutch turned their attention 
southwards towards the Sunda Straits and Java, away from the Straits 
of Melaka. The Dutch also established their main base in Asia at Batavia 
(present-day Jakarta) in 1619. They became the dominant European power 
in Southeast Asia after capturing Melaka from the Portuguese in 1641.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 89) ---
By 
the 18th century, maritime traffic was bypassing Singapore. Another factor for Singapore’s decline was the political crisis that resulted 
from the assassination of the childless Sultan Mahmud Shah II in 1699. This ended the dynasty of Sultans who claimed to be from the direct  
bloodline of Sang Nila Utama. The capital of the Johor Sultanate later 
shifted to Riau, and Bintan developed as the main regional emporium.4 
By this time, trade had moved decisively away from Singapore. Since the 
Johor capital was no longer in the Johor River region, there was no longer 
need for a Shahbandar in Singapore. By the 18th century, Riau and other regional ports had replaced Singapore 
as centres of trade that linked the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. As Singapore had lost its importance, shipping now bypassed the island. Singapore and the nearby coastal regions became sparsely populated 
places where the inhabitants lived off the sea and pirates visited to raid 
or hide. Was Singapore always such a sparsely populated island and only 
occasionally used as a hideout by pirates as described by John Crawfurd 
(see page 11)? While we have established in this chapter that early 
Singapore certainly had connections with the region and the world 
at different periods of its history, there is incomplete evidence to 
show the extent of these connections. In the next chapter, you 
will find out how Singapore became a British trading post. 4 An emporium is a centre of trade and business activities. Early 17-century painting by Hendrick Cornelisz

CASE INVESTIGATION
In the following chapter, you will 
learn about the establishment of a 
British trading post in Singapore in 
1819. You already know that some 
Europeans, such as the Portuguese 
and the Dutch, had been in Southeast 
Asia since the 16th century and that 
their presence grew steadily in the 
following centuries.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 93) ---
The Portuguese 
controlled Melaka for over a century, 
and the Dutch had established a vast 
empire in the East Indies (present-
day Indonesia) by the 17th century. However, during this period, were 
the Portuguese and the Dutch 
interested in Singapore? Read the 
following sources to find out more. By the beginning of the 17th century, the Portuguese and the Dutch were fighting over the waters around Singapore. The 
Dutch wished to challenge the Portuguese and Spanish control of trade in many parts of the world. In Southeast Asia, 
the Dutch attacked Portuguese trading fleets* approaching the waters around Singapore while en route from Macao [in 
China] to Melaka. – Adapted from an account by historians Tan Tai Yong, Kwa Chong Guan and Derek Heng of the conflict  
in the waters around Singapore during the 16th and 17th centuries, published in 2009

In the middle of the Singapore Straits, there is an island [present-day Sentosa]. Your Majesty should order 
that a very strong fortress* be built here. One side of the Strait is so narrow that it can be closed off with a 
chain; the other is wider, but no ship can pass through either of these Straits without being in close distance 
of the fortress, which can then sink them using their cannons. This is the best way to destroy the Dutch 
rebels. If Your Majesty were to send 40 ships, it would be more likely to put an end to the Dutch who are in the  
East Indies. – Adapted from a letter by European trader Jacques de Coutre to the Spanish King, written in 1610
* A fortress is a place or building set up for defence against enemy attacks.SOURCE B
The Dutch East India Company recognised the importance of the Singapore Straits and its surrounding lands 
and islands when they arrived in the Straits region. After much thinking, they decided not to establish a base 
in the Singapore-Johor region.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 95) ---
From then on, the Dutch would focus on the Sunda Straits and northwestern 
Java instead. – Adapted from an account by historian Peter Borschberg of the Dutch search  
for a base for their operations in Southeast Asia in the 1600s, published in 2016SOURCE D
Johor is unsuitable as a base, because one cannot reach it every time of the year. It is important for a base to 
be established at a location which will not be too affected by monsoon winds. I cannot think of a better place 
than in the Strait of Sunda or Banten [in the west of Java]. We can always get there easily, once we have 
passed the Cape of Good Hope. I had an eye on the islands of Jeyakerta [Jakarta], which are very well situated 
for defence as well as good locations from which to manage everything. – Adapted from a letter by Dutch Admiral Matelieff de Jonge commenting on instructions  
by the Dutch East India Company Directors to look into the establishment of a base  
in the region of the Johor River, close to Singapore, written in 1610SOURCE C

FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)Why Did the British Become 
More Involved in Southeast Asia 
in the 19th Century? Prior to the 19th century, most of British trade in Asia was conducted 
by the British East India Company (EIC). However, there was limited EIC 
presence in Southeast Asia. British presence in the region only grew from 
the mid-18th century onwards due to the need to protect the India-China 
trade and interest in the spice trade. Importance of the India-China Trade
By the late 18th century, much of India was under the control of the EIC. Trade between India and China had become the EIC’s major source of 
income. The EIC exported cotton and opium from India, as well as wool 
from Britain, to China. In return, the EIC bought tea, silk and porcelain from 
China, which were highly sought after in Britain at that time. To protect its lucrative India-China trade, the British needed to control the 
Straits of Melaka and the waters surrounding Singapore, which linked the 
Indian Ocean with the South China Sea (see Map 2.2). However, at the start 
of the 19th century, these were controlled by the Dutch. The EIC’s trade 
was confined to Bencoolen (present-day Bengkulu, see Map 2.3 on page 
49). Therefore, there was a need to find places in Southeast Asia that were 
free from Dutch control. CHINA

was set up in 1600 to help British 
traders find larger markets and 
establish profitable trade with countries 
in Asia. It was given a royal charter 
to trade in India, Southeast Asia and 
China by the British government. This 
meant that only the traders of the EIC 
could trade in these areas. Among its 
employees was Raffles.

HOW DID SINGAPORE BECOME A BRITISH TRADING POST?Interest in the Spice Trade
From the 1400s onwards, spices such as cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg 
from parts of Asia were as valuable as gold in Europe. They were used for 
cooking, medicinal purposes, and were especially useful for preserving food 
as refrigeration and artificial preservatives had not yet been developed.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 108) ---
Due to the high demand for spices, prices rose and the consumption of 
spices became an indication of one’s wealth. The EIC also wanted a share 
of the flourishing spice trade in Southeast Asia. The European powers began competing with each other for control over  
the spice trade. Near the end of the 15th century, explorers began searching 
for new ways to reach the spice-producing regions. Cloves

century. Valuable spices such as cloves, mace and nutmeg could only be found on the Spice Islands. By 1700, the demand for spices 
in Europe had decreased while the demand for Indian textiles and cotton had grown. Spices further declined in importance in the 
18th century with the growth of the coffee and tea trades. However, despite the relative decline in the importance of the spice trade, 
it was still lucrative to the European traders in Southeast Asia.DID YOU KNOW?

1650, 
with Dutch ships in the foregroundSince the 17th century, the British and the Dutch had been fierce 
competitors for trade outside Europe. Britain had already developed trade 
links with China, India and parts of Southeast Asia. However, the Dutch 
controlled a larger part of Southeast Asia as compared to the British. Thus, the British had limited success establishing a trading port in Southeast 
Asia up to this time. Problems Faced by the British EIC  
in Southeast Asia
Dutch Control of the Spice Trade
As you learnt in Chapter 1, the Dutch were already a dominant European 
power in Southeast Asia. At the height of its power, the Dutch East India 
Company (VOC) monopolised1 the trade in cloves, mace and nutmeg. After the Dutch took over Melaka in 1641, they shifted the main trade 
routes to the Sunda Straits. Dutch ports such as Batavia (present-day 
Jakarta) became the key trading ports in Southeast Asia, replacing Melaka. By the 19th century, the Dutch were able to control trade along the Straits 
of Melaka and the Sunda Straits. Dutch control over these waterways 
meant that the British were confined to trading in Bencoolen.The Dutch East India Company, or 
Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie 
(VOC), was founded in 1602 and 
served the interests of the Dutch 
government overseas. It was crucial 
in helping the Dutch government 
negotiate treaties and establish colonies 
overseas. The VOC was issued a charter 
by the Dutch government that granted 
it exclusive trading rights covering the 
areas from the Indian Ocean to the 
Pacific Ocean. The VOC ceased to 
exist in 1799.DID YOU KNOW? The logo of the VOC

After 1786, the British had two trading ports, in Penang and Bencoolen, 
where British ships could stop for refuelling or repairs on their journeys 
between India and China. However, both were unsuitable trading ports 
due to their location (see Map 2.3 below).

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 112) ---
Bencoolen was unsuitable as it was situated on the western side of Sumatra

FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)
Sir Stamford Raffles, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, sought to increase British presence in 
Southeast Asia. He sought a port that would command the southern entrance to the Straits of Melaka.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 114) ---
Such a port would help the British to compete with the Dutch for trade and could serve as the halfway 
port for traders travelling between India and China. The Dutch lodged official protests against 
Raffles’ initiatives, which resulted in them being 
rejected by his superiors. The British did not 
want to anger the Dutch.In September 1818, Raffles went to India and 
obtained the support of the Governor-General of 
India, Lord Hastings, to establish a British port 
in Southeast Asia. Lord Hastings recognised the 
threat the Dutch could pose to British interests  
in the region. He authorised Raffles to establish  
a trading post at the southern end of the Straits  
of Melaka, provided that this act would not bring 
the EIC into conflict with the Dutch. The Dutch possess the only passes The Dutch possess the only passes

HOW DID SINGAPORE BECOME A BRITISH TRADING POST?Suitability of Singapore
Singapore possessed several qualities that made it an ideal trading port. First, Singapore had a natural sheltered harbour. Second, Singapore had a 
good supply of drinking water. Third, its location at the southern tip of the 
Straits of Melaka meant that Singapore could be the halfway port between 
India and China. Find out more about these qualities in the “Learn a Skill”

Raffles and Major William Farquhar began searching for a suitable place to establish a British trading 
post. Farquhar’s preferred location, the Karimun Islands, proved unsuitable. On 28 January 1819, 
Raffles, Farquhar and their eight ships dropped anchor off St John’s Island. Raffles was greeted by 
some Orang Laut, who informed him that Singapore was not occupied by the Dutch. However, the EIC headquarters in London had 
sent a letter to India forbidding Raffles from 
laying claim on any territory that could possibly be 
claimed by the Dutch. As the British government 
wanted to keep the Dutch as their close allies, they 
assured the Dutch that Raffles had no authority to 
undertake such political decisions. But by the time 
the letter reached India, Raffles had already set 
sail to search for a new trading post.

FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)How Did the British Establish  
a Trading Post in Singapore? As you have seen in Sources 1 and 2 (pages 54 and 55), Singapore 
possessed several qualities that made it an ideal port. However,  
establishing a trading post on the island was not an easy task for the British.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 126) ---
They faced a number of obstacles in doing so. On 29 January 1819, Raffles and Farquhar met the local chief, Temenggong 
Abdul Rahman. Raffles informed the Temenggong that the EIC wanted to 
set up a trading post in Singapore. The Temenggong replied that he did not have the authority to grant 
permission to the EIC. As Singapore was part of Johor-Riau at that time, 
only the Sultan of Johor-Riau could do so. However, Johor-Riau was a vassal 
of the Dutch as a result of the Treaties of 1784 and 1818. Raffles knew that he had to find a solution. An opportunity arose after the 
Temenggong told him what had happened after the death of the previous 
Sultan. Read the following illustrated story to find out more. The late Sultan Mahmud Shah, ruler of Johor-Riau, 
had two sons: Tengku Abdul Rahman, the younger 
son, and Tengku Hussein, the elder son and heir. When Sultan Mahmud passed away in 1812, 
only Tengku Abdul Rahman was present. Tengku 
Hussein was away in Pahang for his marriage. The Bugis chiefs, who had considerable influence 
in Johor-Riau, appointed Tengku Abdul Rahman 
as the new Sultan in Tengku Hussein’s absence.The SUCCESSION DISPUTEThe SUCCESSION DISPUTE

HOW DID SINGAPORE BECOME A BRITISH TRADING POST? Those who supported Tengku Hussein, including 
the widow of the late Sultan Mahmud Shah, were 
unhappy, but they were powerless to do anything. Without a strong ally, Tengku Hussein decided to 
live quietly in Riau.Raffles learnt about this and invited Tengku Hussein 
to Singapore, promising him protection and financial 
assistance. With the Temenggong’s help, Raffles 
secretly brought Tengku Hussein back to Singapore. Tengku Hussein probably saw Raffles’ invitation to 
come to Singapore as an opportunity to counter 
Dutch support for the Bugis and Sultan Abdul Rahman. Support from the British would likely increase his 
power in the region. On 6 February 1819, Raffles recognised Tengku Hussein as the 
rightful Sultan. He signed an agreement with Sultan Hussein and the 
Temenggong which allowed the British to build a trading post in the 
southern part of Singapore island. In return, the Temenggong and 
Sultan Hussein would receive an annual payment as compensation. The British also agreed to give protection and support to the Sultan 
and Temenggong if they agreed not to make any treaties with other 
Western powers. After signing the treaty, Raffles made Farquhar the 
first Resident * of Singapore and left for Penang the next day. * The title of Resident is given to the British officer in charge of a British settlement. How would Raffles’ 
actions have been 
viewed by the  
different parties?Think!

FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)Dutch and British Responses
The Dutch were angry when they heard the British had established a 
trading post in Singapore. They contested Raffles’ actions, claiming that 
Singapore belonged to them since it was part of Johor-Riau, which was 
under the Dutch area of influence. Initially, the British government in London was also angry with Raffles 
as his actions threatened its friendship with the Dutch. Lord Hastings, 
however, was convinced of the need for a British trading post in Singapore 
to prevent Dutch advancement in the region around the Straits of 
Melaka and the Sunda Straits. Over the next few years, British traders in  
Southeast Asia also became convinced of the need to retain Singapore for 
the protection and expansion of British trade in the East. The dispute was only settled several years later. How Did the British Resolve  
the Dispute over Singapore? Despite the hostility between the Dutch and the British over 
the question of Singapore, neither declared war on the other. Both governments wanted to remain on friendly terms.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 130) ---
During recent European wars which took place between 1789 
and 1815, the British became aware of the importance of the 
Netherlands to their defence and security. It was therefore 
important for the British to keep the Dutch as an ally against 
future threats. For the Dutch, the wars in Europe had severely disrupted 
their trade and shipping. They had become bankrupt and had 
borrowed heavily from Britain. The Dutch therefore did not 
want to be involved in more wars as this would further harm 
their economy. 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty
With all these considerations in mind, the British and the Dutch 
agreed to settle their disputes. On 17 March 1824, they signed 
the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty, in which the Dutch withdrew 
their objections to British presence in Singapore. Detail from Article 12 of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty,  
17 March 1824, which states that the Netherlands 
“withdraws the objections which have been made 
to the occupation of the island of Singapore …” 
and the British were excluded from “any of the 
other islands south of the Singapore Straits”  
(lines highlighted in yellow)

As a result of the treaty, the Malay Peninsula and the East Indies (present-
day Indonesia) were divided into two spheres of influence2 (see Map 2.5). The British transferred Bencoolen to the Dutch in exchange for Melaka.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 132) ---
The British now occupied Penang, Melaka and Singapore. According to the 
treaty, the Malay Peninsula and Singapore came within the British sphere 
of influence while Sumatra and all islands to the south of the Straits of 
Singapore were under the Dutch sphere of influence. The Dutch had 
control of the trade within their sphere of influence but not beyond. Map 2.5: Map showing Dutch and British bases after the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty Map 2.4: This map, printed in the early 19th century,

The treaty that was signed on 6 February 1819 did not give the British

1824 when Dr John Crawfurd, the second Resident of Singapore, 
signed a treaty with Sultan Hussein that allowed the British to take 
control over the whole island of Singapore. The Sultan and the 
Temenggong handed over control of Singapore island to the EIC 
in return for larger sums of money than they had previously been 
entitled to.

HOW DID SINGAPORE BECOME A BRITISH TRADING POST?What Did the British Do 
to Develop Singapore as 
a Settlement Between 
1819 and 1826? Although Raffles was the one who signed the 1819 Treaty 
that allowed the British to establish a trading post in 
Singapore, he was not the only person involved in its 
development. In fact, he left for Penang the day after 
signing the treaty. Let us look at the efforts of some individuals who helped 
to develop the settlement. Major William Farquhar
Before leaving Singapore, Raffles appointed Major  
William Farquhar as the first Resident of Singapore and 
left him with instructions on what to do. For a start, Farquhar set up defence positions at the 
Singapore River and Government Hill (present-day Fort 
Canning) with the help of 100 sepoys (Indian soldiers). This 
was due to the fear of a Dutch attack to enforce their 
claims over Singapore.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 136) ---
The British decided to make Singapore a free port. This 
meant that fees were not collected from ships entering 
the port; taxes were only imposed on selected products, 
such as opium. Farquhar placed a British official on  
St John’s Island (located to the south of the main island 
of Singapore) to inform passing ships about the new 
settlement and its free port.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 137) ---
Many traders came, and 
Singapore soon grew into a bustling marketplace. By 1823, Farquhar had attracted many people, including 
traders and labourers, from Melaka to Singapore. Traders 
from Melaka helped solve Singapore’s food shortage issues, 
which were brought about by the increasing population. To raise funds to ensure the smooth running of Singapore, 
Farquhar went against Raffles’ orders and sold licences for 
gambling and the sale of opium and liquor. Using the funds 
generated from the sale of these licences, Farquhar set up a 
police force. Major William Farquhar
Farquhar was so popular with the people of Singapore that 
when he left in 1823, thousands turned up to send him off. They brought him gifts, including the silver epergne 
(ornamental table centrepiece) below from the Chinese 
community. Today, there is no road or place in Singapore that bears 
Farquhar’s name. Farquhar Street in Kampong Glam  
was the only road named after him, but it is no longer  
in existence. Farquhar was an avid collector of the drawings of wildlife 
and flora native to the Malay Peninsula. Farquhar Garden, 
part of the newly restored Fort Canning Park, was officially 
opened on 27 May 2019. This garden features plants which 
fascinated Farquhar, such as gambier and guava.DID YOU KNOW? Silver epergne given to Farquhar by the Chinese in Singapore

FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)Raffles had a keen interest in natural history. During his time in 
Southeast Asia, he collected specimens of plants and animals. The Rafflesia  plant and Dinopium rafflesii  (olive-backed 
woodpecker) are some of the plants and animals named  
after him. On his last visit to Singapore, Raffles set up a botanical and 
experimental garden around Government Hill to cultivate cash 
crops such as cloves and nutmeg. Cash crops are crops grown for 
selling rather than for self-consumption.DID YOU KNOW? Sir Stamford Raffles
From 1818 to 1824, Raffles was based in Bencoolen, Sumatra. During this period, he only visited Singapore three times. In October 1822, Raffles made his third and final visit to 
Singapore and remained until June 1823. It was during this 
visit that he realised Farquhar had not developed the 
island in the way he wanted. He became unhappy with 
Farquhar and dismissed him. With the help of Lieutenant 
Philip Jackson, Raffles designed the Singapore Town Plan. This Plan allocated areas to the respective ethnic groups 
in an orderly manner (see Map 2.6). Raffles also shut down gambling dens, which had been 
a source of income during Farquhar’s term as Resident. Raffles felt that gambling was harmful to the population, 
and had banned it when he was in charge of Bencoolen 
from 1817 to 1822. Sir Stamford Raffles

FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)Dr John Crawfurd
Dr John Crawfurd was appointed by Raffles as the second Resident of 
Singapore during his final visit to Singapore. After Raffles left Singapore in August 1823, Crawfurd reintroduced licences 
for public gambling and the sale of opium. The profits earned were used 
to ensure the smooth running of Singapore. Crawfurd also maintained 
the policy of free trade in Singapore, in accordance with Raffles’ wishes. Singapore’s first newspaper and street lighting were also introduced when 
Crawfurd was Resident. Crawfurd played an important role in the signing of the 1824 Treaty of 
Friendship and Alliance, in which Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong 
handed over control of Singapore to the EIC. With the signing of this 
treaty, Singapore officially came under British control. Dr John Crawfurd

Conclusion 
The British established a trading post in Singapore in 1819 after a long 
period when there was little trade or economic activity in Singapore. In 
doing so, the British had to overcome challenges posed mainly by Dutch 
dominance in the region. The uncertainty over the status of Singapore led 
to claims by both the British and the Dutch. This was only resolved with 
the signing of the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. The British were then able to 
focus on developing Singapore as a trading port. In 1826, the EIC grouped Singapore together with Penang and Melaka to 
form the Straits Settlements. What was the impact of this on Singapore?

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 143) ---
Did the free port of Singapore take off after 1826? You will learn about this 
in Chapter 3.Crawfurd followed in his father’s 
footsteps and studied medicine at the 
University of Edinburgh in Scotland. With an interest in languages and history, 
he also studied the Malay and Javanese 
languages during his time in Southeast 
Asia. After leaving Singapore in 1826, he 
was sent on a mission to Burma (present-
day Myanmar) in 1826 before returning 
to the United Kingdom in 1830. Crawfurd made several unsuccessful 
attempts to enter the British Parliament 
in the 1830s. In 1868 (the last year of 
his life), he became the first President 
of the Straits Settlements Association, 
which was established to protect 
British interests in the region. Crawford Street, Crawford Lane, 
Crawford Bridge and Crawford Park 
are named after him, although his 
surname is spelt differently.DID YOU KNOW?

FROM TEMASEK TO SINGAPORE (1299–EARLY 1800 S)Today, Raffles’ name can be seen all over Singapore: Raffles Place MRT station and Raffles Boulevard, just 
to give a few examples. This is because Raffles is often recognised as the founder of Singapore.

However, 
not everyone takes this view. Given what you have learnt about the contributions of Raffles, Farquhar and Crawfurd to the development 
of Singapore, who do you think founded Singapore? Before answering this question, think about what it 
means to be a founder. What does it mean to found a place? Some maintain that Raffles was the founder as he signed the 1819 Treaty that allowed the British to 
set up a trading post in the southern part of Singapore. Others argue that Farquhar was the founder of 
Singapore as he did the work of building Singapore from scratch. Some may even consider Crawfurd the 
founder as he signed the 1824 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance that gave the British control over the  
whole island. Read the sources that follow and conduct your own investigation into who founded Singapore.Who founded Singapore?CASE INVESTIGATION

Sacred  
to the memory  
of 
Major General William Farquhar  
of the H.E.I.C. * Service  
and Madras Engineer Corps  
who served in the East Indies  
upwards of 33 years. During 20 years of his valuable life  
he was appointed to offices  
of high responsibility  
under the civil government of India  
having in addition to his military duties 
served as Resident in Malacca  
and afterwards at Singapore  
which later settlement he founded. In all the stations† which he filled  
he acquired honour to himself  
and rendered‡ service to his country. He departed this life at Early Bank, Perth,  
on the 11th of May 1839, 
highly respected and deeply regretted  
by all who had the happiness 
of his acquaintance.SOURCE D
Farquhar, the first and only official to hold the dual posts of Resident and commandant in Singapore, deserves much more 
credit in the founding of Singapore than he is popularly given. He had initiated the search for a new post and negotiated 
the commercial treaty with Riau that laid the groundwork for Hastings’ instructions to Raffles to establish a new post. ... Farquhar built up Singapore’s trade and population to such an extent that Britain’s initial disinterest in Singapore 
changed to a determination to retain it. While Raffles had higher responsibility for Singapore, it was Farquhar who, 
against the odds, had built the settlement from scratch into a successful port. – Adapted from a description by Australian writer Nadia Wright of William Farquhar’s

HOW DID SINGAPORE BECOME A BRITISH TRADING POST? Crawfurd cannot be considered a founder or co-founder of the colonial settlement. It was Raffles and Farquhar who laid 
the foundations in January–February 1819, and could at least lay claim to this distinction, as reflected in the inscription 
on the base of Raffles’ statue in Westminster Abbey, London, and that on Farquhar’s grave in Perth, Scotland. Yet, it was Crawfurd who actually signed the final treaty which brought Singapore under British control, and deserves to 
be remembered and commemorated for this achievement. Sadly, he is the least remembered of the three, though there 
are a few traces in Singapore. – Adapted from a description by Singaporean historian Ernest Chew  
of John Crawfurd’s contributions to Singapore, 2002SOURCE E
In some ways, history has been unfair to Farquhar and Crawfurd, who gave early Singapore the efficient administration* 
that Raffles could not supply. The actual implementation of Raffles’ policies fell to Crawfurd.

HOW DID BRITISH RULE AND EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS AFFECT SINGAPORE’S GROWTH AS A PORT CITY FROM 1819 TO 1942?When the British first arrived in 1819, there was uncertainty over Singapore's 
status as a British trading post. The status of Singapore was established 
when it came under British rule after the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty 
and the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in 1824. Singapore was declared a 
free port from its founding days and soon became the centre for regional 
trade. Many people flocked to the island to enjoy the benefits of free  
trade.1 By the eve of the Japanese invasion in 1942, Singapore had become 
a very prosperous and important port city.2
What were the reasons for Singapore’s growth? In this chapter, we will look 
at the role of the British in developing Singapore as a port city. We will also 
look at the impact of external developments, such as the opening of the 
Suez Canal and the Great Depression, on Singapore’s growth.CHAPTER

How Did the British Help Develop 
Singapore into a Port City? The British played an important role in Singapore’s development. Let us

 Figure 3.2: Bar graph showing the growth in Singapore’s trade from 1824 to 1873Free Port Status
A key factor attracting traders to Singapore was its free port status, which 
the British put in place in 1819. Traders came in ships from different places 
and could trade freely with one another in Singapore. They were not 
required to pay taxes on the goods they carried. Much of Singapore’s trade in the 19th century involved transshipment and 
entrepôt trade. Transshipment refers to the transfer of goods from one 
trading ship to another while in transit at the port. The repackaging and 
redistribution of imported manufactured goods and regional produce is 
known as entrepôt trade.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 175) ---
Profits were made by processing and packaging 
goods before they were re-exported elsewhere. Study the illustrated story 
on the next two pages to find out more about Singapore’s entrepôt trade. What were the reasons for transshipment and entrepôt trade? Why were 
the goods not sent directly by the producers to the consumers? This was 
because Singapore provided an easily accessible, tax-free and centrally 
located place for both Western and Asian goods to be collected and 
exchanged. As a result, Singapore flourished as a port city. Between 1830 and 1867, 
its trade almost tripled. By the time Singapore was handed over to the 
Colonial Office in 1867, it was already one of the most important and 
prosperous ports in the British Empire. $89.7m

Statistical data can be represented in different ways, such as charts, tables or graphs. A chart, table or graph 
tells a story and allows people studying it to extract relevant information and draw conclusions about a topic. The following are some useful tips for analysing a chart, table or graph: 
• Look at the title of the chart, table or graph. • Examine the column headers (for tables) or legend (for charts and graphs) to find out what the data 
represents. • Survey the dates and note the time interval. • Look for trends or patterns of change. • Scan the data to find out whether the numbers are moving upwards or downwards. • Note the level of the increases or decreases. • Use your historical knowledge to explain the changes.

Administrative Changes
Under the British, Singapore went through several changes in  
administration. These administrative changes influenced its growth as a 
port city. From 1819 to 1823, all decisions regarding Singapore had to be 
approved by Sir Stamford Raffles, who was the Lieutenant-Governor of 
Bencoolen. Singapore was placed under the control of India after Raffles 
returned for good to England in June 1823. In August 1824, Singapore was 
formally transferred to the EIC, which controlled Singapore from 1824 to 
1858. Look at Figure 3.5 below to see how Singapore was governed from 
1824 to 1942. 1824–1858

Pearl’s Hill (left) to Tanjong Rhu (right). Mount 
Wallich (located at present-day Telok Ayer) was 
levelled to reclaim Telok Ayer Bay. Despite little 
financial resources provided by the EIC and the 
British India government before 1867, Singapore 
prospered, as shown by the increasing size of the 
town area in the painting.Administration by the East India Company and  
the British India Government (1819–1867)
When Singapore was established in 1819, it was placed under the 
administration of Bencoolen, where Raffles was Lieutenant-Governor. After Raffles returned to England for good in June 1823, Singapore was 
placed under the British India government. In 1824, Singapore was formally 
transferred to the East India Company (EIC), which controlled Singapore 
from 1824 to 1858. During this time, the government in Singapore had difficulty managing the 
needs of the expanding population and the increasing size of Singapore’s 
trade. At the same time, it had trouble raising money to pay for better port 
facilities, security and social services such as education and healthcare. When the government wanted to impose taxes on Singapore’s trade, the 
traders protested. They argued that any proposals to tax trade would affect 
Singapore’s free-port status, which in turn would affect their businesses. Unable to raise funds from imposing taxes on Singapore’s trade, the 
government had to turn to taxing gambling, opium and liquor. Owners 
of gambling houses, opium shops and liquor shops who could offer the 
largest sum of money to the government were granted the right to collect 
taxes. However, when gambling was banned in 1829, the tax on gambling 
houses could no longer be collected. This greatly reduced the government’s 
revenue.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 187) ---
Thus, there was insufficient money for improving conditions in 
Singapore and for providing social services. 87

To make up for the shortage, the EIC supplied the Singapore government 
with money. However, this changed in the 1830s, when the EIC lost its 
dominant control of trade with China as the British government opened it 
up to other British traders. Given that the EIC had founded the settlements in Penang and Singapore 
to protect and promote its China trade, it now lost interest in the Straits 
Settlements. As a trading company, the EIC prioritised maximising profits. Since the Straits Settlements were being run at a loss, the EIC began to cut 
costs and refused to spend more money to improve the Straits Settlements. It dismissed many officials to reduce their number and cut the pay of 
those who remained. Illustration by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd showing the interior of the headquarters of the EIC at Leadenhall 
Street in London, where cargoes from the East were put up for auction, 1820. From this building, the EIC 
ruled over many parts of the world, including British India and the Straits Settlements, with little interference 
from the British government.

Administration as a Crown Colony (1867–1942)
The year 1867 was important in Singapore’s history as the colony was put 
under the direct control of the Colonial Office. The conversion of the 
Straits Settlements into a Crown Colony3 of Britain allowed Singapore to 
enjoy nearly 75 years of peaceful administration. The Straits Settlements owes a debt of gratitude to the East India Company. It is true that by 1867, the prosperity of 
Singapore was largely due to the resourcefulness of its people. However, it should not be forgotten that the Company 
established an able and just administration, which allowed Singapore to build up its trade freely. While it is easy to 
condemn the Company for being stingy, it was not a little thing that for 34 years from 1833 to 1867, the British India 
Government supported a constant drain on its finances to maintain a colony from which it gained no profit, and which 
hardly paid a cent in taxes. – Adapted from an account by British historian L.

Law and Order
Crime
Singapore’s population increased from barely 150 in 1819 to about 6,000 
in 1821. Large numbers of settlers continued to come into Singapore 
thereafter. A census4 taken in 1911 showed that there were 57 different 
languages spoken among the population. With the influx of migrants5 
and the growth of trade, there were also more robberies, murders and 
other crimes. Maintaining law and order was a challenge. Police Force
In 1820, William Farquhar, the Resident of Singapore, made his son-in-law, 
Francis James Bernard, the chief police officer. However, Bernard had other 
duties and could not give all his time and attention to his police work. Moreover, the police force was a very small one, consisting of the chief 
police officer, one writer, one jailor in charge of the prison, one European 
sergeant and eight Asian policemen. This was hardly enough to keep the 
peace in a population of a few thousand settlers. Over the years, the police force remained small and weak. In 1843, some 
European and Asian traders in Singapore called a public meeting to talk 
about the inability of the small police force to maintain law and order. The traders then wrote to the Governor to ask for a stronger police force. They pointed out that the many crimes on the island made their lives and 
property unsafe. As a result, Thomas Dunman was appointed as Deputy Magistrate and 
Deputy Superintendent of Police in 1843, and as Singapore’s first full-time 
Commissioner of Police in 1857. During his tenure, Dunman persisted in 
making the police force more appealing to potential recruits by fighting 
for better working conditions and higher wages. In doing so, he managed 
to attract better men into the police force. Thus, he was able to enlarge 
the police force by taking in more men, especially those of good character. The Central Police Station located  
on Hill Street, 1869Thomas Dunman (1814–1887) was 
respected by both European officials 
and traders, and had useful contacts 
with the Chinese community. A very 
hands-on man, he was usually out at 
night performing different duties. His 
daily schedule saw him up and about 
at four in the morning, only returning 
home at midnight. Dunman took 
good care of the men under him and 
even conducted night classes to teach 
them to read and write. He received 
a Sword of Honour from Governor 
Butterworth for putting down the 1854 
Hokkien-Teochew Riots. Dunman

after him. Who was

Despite Dunman’s best efforts, he could not solve all the problems of 
crime and disorder. His men did their work well and tried to manage the 
situation when serious riots broke out, but the rioters usually outnumbered 
them and the government had to send soldiers to help the police. Still, by 
the time Dunman retired in 1871, he had achieved much by reducing gang 
robberies and improving the quality and morale of the police officers. After Dunman’s retirement, reforms to the police force continued. A police training school was started in 1881, and a separate detective force 
was established in 1884. By the 1930s, with the use of telephones, motor cars and radio 
communications, the work of the police force had become more efficient. At the same time, officers who had gone through professional training 
under the police cadet system filled senior posts in the police force.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 199) ---
The police force was about 2,000 strong, unlike the small team it started 
with in the early 1820s. All these improvements made Singapore a safer and 
more peaceful place. Officers from the Detective Branch, 1906. This branch was later renamed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).Riots broke out quite frequently in

dead and some 300 homes destroyed. Other major riots included the 1876

Labour Abuses, Secret Society Problems and Prostitution
As Singapore grew as a commercial centre, it attracted more and more 
Chinese migrants, who were drawn by the prospect of work as well as 
the opportunity to flee from wars, poverty and famine in China. By 1871, 
the Chinese community comprised 58 per cent of Singapore’s population, 
numbering about 55,000 in total. However, Singapore’s rapid development 
and prosperity had another dark side: labour abuses, secret society 
problems and prostitution. Mural by Yip Yew Chong showing the arrival of

Labour Abuse of Coolies
The Chinese migrants who came to Singapore were known as sinkehs (new 
guests). Some had the money to pay for their passage from China.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 204) ---
When 
they arrived in Singapore, they were free to take on any job they found. However, there were others who were too poor to pay for their passage 
and had to find a coolie-agent, who would pay their passage money. In return, these coolies promised to work for any employer who was 
willing to pay the coolie-agent a sum of money to employ them (see Figure 
3.7). This sum was much more than the passage money, as it included the 
coolie-agent’s fee. The coolies would then have to work without pay for 
a year or more to pay off the debts they owed their employers for paying 
the coolie-agents. They were usually provided with food and lodgings, and 
might be given a small sum of money for the whole period of their service. The demand for Chinese coolies in the mid-19th century was not limited 
to Singapore. There was also a great need for them in Australia, the United 
States, the plantations in Java and Sumatra, and the tin mines in Malaya. The coolie trade grew very quickly, and Singapore became one of its major 
centres. Thousands of coolies poured into Singapore every year, many of 
whom were then sent to work in neighbouring countries or to other parts 
of the world. This photograph, taken in the early part of the  
20th century, shows a Chinese coolie carrying  
a gunny sack, a common sight in Singapore

1. What does Source 2 tell you about the way the coolies were brought into Singapore? 2. What do the two sources suggest about the coolies’ experiences?Coolie-agents were responsible for finding coolies to meet the demand 
in different parts of the world. They were often tempted by huge profits, 
and thus tried to obtain coolies by any means possible. While thousands 
of poor Chinese were willing to seek their fortunes abroad, many others 
were tricked or kidnapped by coolie-agents in China. Conditions during the voyage from China were very poor. The coolie ships 
were often described as “floating hells” . It was common for hundreds of 
men to be crammed aboard a junk meant for a fraction of the number. As 
a result of the overcrowding as well as the lack of food and water, many 
coolies died during the long voyage. The coolies’ misery did not end when they landed in Singapore. To prevent 
them from escaping, many of them were locked up in houses that were 
cramped and unhygienic. They were closely guarded by gangsters hired by 
the coolie-agents until employers were found. Read Sources 2 and 3 to learn more about how the coolies were treated. The coolies are mostly from the countryside of China. They all cried out for protection. They declared that they had been 
tricked to leave their homes by promises that they would be brought to Singapore and receive good wages as labourers 
and craftsmen. There was a promise that after paying a low sum for their journey, they would soon save enough money 
to send to their friends or to return home with. Instead, they had heard that they would be sent to work in the tin mines 
of another country. We went to inspect a house in Telok Ayer, where the coolies had been confined. We found the place to be unfit even to keep 
pigs. Many men were confined here without notice. - Adapted from a report that William Pickering, Protector of the Chinese in Singapore,  
submitted to the Legislative Council in Singapore on February 1877SOURCE 2
A friend of mine suggested I leave China by saying, “Look how poor you are here. If you follow me, I can take you to 
Singapore, where you will get such good employment. Very soon you will pay off the small amount of passage money 
required and will save a lot of money.’’ On arriving in Singapore, we were taken to a shop upstairs and were locked up, 
only having very little rice and saltfish. We could not go out for anything.

Secret Society Problems
The large number of Chinese migrants in Singapore saw 
the emergence of another problem: secret societies.6
Many of those who arrived from China found it useful 
to join a secret society. They were mostly poor and 
uneducated young men who had never been outside 
their hometown. In Singapore, where they were far from 
their families and friends, they felt lonely and helpless. Thus, when they were befriended by members of a secret 
society who helped them to find work or lodgings, they 
would end up joining the secret society. As members, they could enjoy the protection of the 
society. For example, when they became sick, the secret 
society would take care of them. When poor members 
died without anyone to bury them, the secret society 
would arrange for a proper burial. By the 1840s, there were several secret societies with 
thousands of members. Their numbers increased with the 
rapid growth of the Chinese population. Despite the support they provided to the migrants, secret 
societies were also a source of problems. Members of 
secret societies often took part in gang robberies, gang 
fights and other forms of lawlessness. Gangs of up to 200 
secret society members would carry out armed robberies, 
usually at night but sometimes in broad daylight, on 
the homes of the rich. These secret societies were also 
responsible for many of the riots that occurred in the 
1840s and 1850s as they fought for the control of territory 
and illegal vice trades such as gambling and prostitution.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 209) ---
For a long time, the government took no steps to tackle 
the problem. This was because the British officials had 
few dealings with most of the Chinese living in Singapore 
and knew very little about how these secret societies 
operated. Until the 1870s, there were no British officials 
who understood the various Chinese dialects. The 
European officers in the police force and all the policemen, 
who were Indians and Malays, did not speak the language 
either, and could not find out anything about the secret 
societies and their activities. Headline of an article published on 25 July 1974 in

SINGAPORE'S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)6 The Chinese secret societies in Singapore were a form of mutual aid for the migrants who came from different parts of China 
in the 19th century. Their origins can be traced to the Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society), a secret society in China founded 
for the purpose of overthrowing the Qing dynasty and restoring the Ming dynasty.

Prostitution
The majority of migrants who came to Singapore for work were Chinese 
males. Most of these migrants were unmarried or had left their wives in 
their homelands. Few Chinese migrant women came to Singapore as it was 
seen as a man’s responsibility to earn a living elsewhere. This resulted in a 
very unbalanced ratio of men to women in Singapore (see Figure 3.8 below). As working conditions were hard for the male migrants, many turned to 
opium smoking, drinking, gambling and visiting brothels7 to escape the 
hardship. There was great demand for prostitutes, which meant that brothel owners 
and traffickers8 could make large profits. In the latter part of the 19th 
century, many young, female migrants from China were tricked into the 
prostitution trade in Singapore. They were promised well-paid jobs, but 
when they arrived in Singapore, they were sold to keepers of brothels and 
forced to earn money for them. Postcard from “Fuji” restaurant at 3 Malay Street 
(present-day indoor street in Bugis Junction

prostitutes, known as karayuki-san, to seek or 
meet customers.During the 19th century, Singapore 
was not only a trading port city. It also 
had a reputation of being a sleazy place 
where prostitutes were regarded as 
part and parcel of daily life.DID YOU KNOW? Figure 3.8: Chart showing the ratio of female to male Chinese in Singapore between 1860 and 1901. For example, in 1860, there were 14 Chinese men for every

Chinese Protectorate and the  
Dangerous Societies Ordinance
It was only after the transfer of Singapore to the Colonial Office in 
1867 that the government made a greater effort to control the Chinese 
population. In May 1877, a government department called the Chinese 
Protectorate was set up to tackle the problems of secret societies, coolie 
abuses, poverty and prostitution among the Chinese community. The head of the department was William Pickering – the first Protector 
of the Chinese. Pickering’s tact, fluency in several Chinese dialects and 
personality helped him gain the trust of the Chinese. He was thus able to 
develop a comprehensive understanding of the complicated operations of 
secret societies. Along with improvements in policing, Pickering managed 
to bring some sense of order to Singapore society. Take a look at the 
illustrated story on the next page to find out more about the work of the 
Chinese Protectorate.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 216) ---
Apart from establishing the Chinese Protectorate, the government also 
pushed through a law to suppress9 dangerous societies and make them 
automatically unlawful. The 1890 Dangerous Societies Ordinance gave the 
Governor the power to banish Chinese migrants and abolish any society 
deemed too dangerous. The threat of banishment was particularly effective 
as the Qing government often arrested and executed such individuals once 
they returned to China. Thus, although disturbances continued to take 
place after the passing of this law, the days of large-scale secret society 
fights that paralysed Singapore were over. William Pickering, first Protector of the Chinese

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 217) ---
All Chinese societies had to register 
with the Chinese Protectorate. The Chinese Protectorate controlled the coolie trade by registering 
the coolie-agents and lodging houses. Pickering’s officers visited 
every coolie ship that arrived from China and inspected the coolie 
houses to ensure that the coolies were treated fairly.The Chinese Protectorate worked 
with the leaders of the Chinese secret 
societies to build trust between the 
British and the community. The Protectorate set up a department called  
Po Leung Kuk (Cantonese for “Office to 
Protect Virtue”), which rescued many young 
girls from being sold to brothels. It also 
provided shelter for those who were poorly 
treated as servants.Despite the government’s best efforts, it was unable to 
completely reduce the power of the secret societies. Fights  
still broke out occasionally and the abuse of coolies and 
women continued.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec1 (Page 218) ---
This was partly because some of the  
coolies and women did not come forward to seek the help  
of the Protectorate.Pickering persuaded the Chinese community to 
settle their quarrels at the Chinese Protectorate 
instead of going to the secret societies. The WO R K  of the CHINESE PROTECTORATEThe WO R K  of the CHINESE PROTECTORATE

Piracy
Apart from dealing with law and order within Singapore, the government 
also had to tackle the problem of piracy in the region. Although it did 
not directly affect most of the people in Singapore, piracy posed a great 
danger to the lives, property and trade of the trading community. Trading 
ships plying10 the Straits of Melaka were often attacked by pirates, their 
cargoes taken, and travellers killed or sold as slaves. Every year the “pirate wind” , or the season between August and October, 
brought large fleets of pirate boats from northern Borneo to the Straits of 
Melaka, where they attacked the trading ships and boats sailing between 
Singapore and Penang. Throughout the year, trading ships were also 
attacked by pirates who came from pirate settlements along the coasts of 
Java, Sumatra and Malaya. The situation became so bad that pirates could be seen attacking ships just 
outside Singapore’s harbour. Because of this, many traders stayed away. Thus, Singapore’s trade suffered greatly and the traders lost huge sums of 
money. The traders repeatedly asked the government in the Straits Settlements 
to take strong action against piracy. However, the Straits Settlements 
government lacked the legal means to punish the pirates and had to send 
them to India for trial. Only after many appeals by the 
traders did the government in India send gunboats to 
patrol the waters. While the gunboats destroyed many pirate ships 
and hideouts, this was only a temporary solution. To suppress piracy completely, a permanent naval 
force was needed in the Straits Settlements, 
something the EIC could not afford. Since the 
Straits government had only three gunboats in 
its fleet, it was unable to curb piracy effectively. Attempts by the traders in Singapore to urge 
the authorities in both India and London 
to take action did not result in much 
change. It was only in the early 1870s 
that piracy became less of a problem 
due to increased patrolling by the 
British and other European powers. 19th-century illustration of an Iranun pirate.

Education
Educational Opportunities (1819–1867)
For the most part of the 19th century, the British government provided 
few education and healthcare services for the people in Singapore. Much of the population were migrants more interested in making money 
before returning home than settling down and raising families. Coupled 
with the government’s constant lack of funds, this created a situation 
in which the provision of social services was not a top priority for the  
British government. From Singapore’s founding till 1867, the British paid little attention to 
education. They did not control English or vernacular education11 and 
focused only on subsidising a few schools. While the British provided 
free primary schooling in the Malay language, very few Tamil-language 
schools were established by the government and none were catered for 
the Chinese population. By and large, the British left the development of education in the hands 
of those who were concerned about it. In other words, schools devised 
their own ways of organising classes, the number and choice of subjects, 
and how they were taught. From 1830 to 1867, there were very few schools 
established by the government. Instead, the establishment of schools was 
left mostly to the efforts of various Christian missionary12 groups and 
European traders. Before 1867, there were few educational opportunities for children as many 
parents did not see the value of English-language education. Few students 
attended these schools. Chinese education, apart from opportunities to 
study Chinese at the Singapore Institution (present-day Raffles Institution), 
was practically non-existent. Raffles Institution located on Bras Basah Road,

Infant Jesus school on Victoria Street, 1924Educational Opportunities (1867–1942)
From 1867 onwards, educational activities in Singapore grew. The expansion 
of education in this period was based on the principle of meeting the 
needs of the British colonial administration. With Singapore’s rapid socio-
economic development after 1867, it became necessary to provide English 
education to create a supply of English-speaking clerks in the government 
and companies. The British government took deliberate steps to promote 
English as the medium of instruction, providing government grants to 
schools that imparted English to students whose home language was not 
English. As for education that did not directly support trade and government 
administration in Singapore, it was usually left to non-governmental 
agencies. This had two major consequences.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 5) ---
First, it led to the growth of 
many Chinese schools run by the Chinese community from 1911 onwards. These schools did not tolerate any interference from the government. Second, schools established by Christian missionaries were given a free 
hand in how they were run. In summary, from 1867 to 1942, although there were improvements in 
the educational provisions by the government, there was a distinct lack 
of quality education that catered for the needs of the local people. Educational opportunities were primarily provided to meet the needs of 
the colonial administration. In the next chapter, you will find out more 
about the other types of schools established by the various communities 
who donated land and money to build schools to give students a chance 
to learn. 107

Healthcare
For a number of decades after the British trading post in Singapore was 
founded, the government did not provide medical services for the general 
public. There were only one or two government doctors who looked after 
sick soldiers in a military hospital, and a few European doctors who served 
mostly the Europeans and rich Asians. The poorer Asians were not so fortunate as they could not afford proper 
medical treatment. Before the 1860s, due to poverty, the Asian population 
suffered from malnutrition, overcrowding and poor sanitation. These 
problems contributed to the high death rate among the Asian population 
in Singapore. After Singapore became a Crown Colony in 1867, coordinated attempts 
were made to improve public health. In 1887, the government set up 
the Public Health Department to tackle health issues in the town area. Some of the measures included setting up a malaria (a mosquito-borne 
disease) committee to supervise the draining of swamps, replacing the 
bucket system with a modern water-carriage sewerage system and clearing 
dirty streets and drains. Attempts were also made to improve housing 
conditions, such as reducing overcrowding in living quarters in Chinatown. One of the streets in Chinatown where coolies 
stayed, c. 1930 Night-soil carriers, late 19th century.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 8) ---
Public healthcare was also improved with the completion of a new 
general hospital building at Outram Road in 1882. The hospital started off 
as a shed near Bras Basah Road and Stamford Road in the early years of  
Singapore’s founding. Its site changed several times before it finally settled 
at Outram Road. To prevent infectious diseases such as smallpox and cholera from 
spreading, a quarantine13 law was passed in 1886 whereby passengers 
arriving in Singapore by sea had to be checked by a doctor. Those found to 
be suffering from infectious diseases were isolated to prevent the diseases 
from spreading.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 9) ---
Despite these steps by the government, the death rate was still higher than 
the birth rate. For example, from 1896 to 1900, the birth rate was 3,835 births 
per year as compared to the death rate, which was 8,847 deaths per year. The General Hospital at Outram Road,

 Living conditions in a typical shophouse

 Living conditions of rickshaw pullers and labourers in a shophouse, c. 1941One reason for the high death rate was the overcrowded and unhygienic 
living conditions of the poor in the town area. Due to the availability of jobs 
there, many of the workers preferred to stay in shophouses in the town 
area. However, these shophouses were often overcrowded, unsanitary and 
poorly ventilated. This gave rise to the spread of highly contagious diseases 
such as tuberculosis and cholera, which affected many of these workers.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 11) ---
Another reason was the poor understanding of certain diseases in the 
19th century. For example, it was not until 1897 that Sir Ronald Ross 
discovered that malaria was transmitted by a type of mosquito. Before 
that, doctors thought the disease was caused by poisonous air coming 
out of rotting plants in swampy areas. Moreover, most Asians did not seek 
treatment when they were ill due to the lack of money or a mistrust of  
Western medicine. By the beginning of the 1940s, public health had generally improved due 
to two reasons. First, economic growth in Singapore generated greater 
government spending on healthcare. Second, the increased awareness of 
the need to improve healthcare led to calls by the local people for the 
government to tackle the spread of diseases in Singapore. 110

Facilities
Expansion of Port Facilities
The process of improving Singapore’s port facilities 
started in the 1850s, along with the expansion of 
Singapore’s trade and the arrival of steamships. By 
this time, the Old Harbour at the Singapore River 
had become increasingly overcrowded. There was 
insufficient space along the river banks to build more 
warehouses for storing goods and coal, or to build dry 
docks for ship-repairing. In 1852, the New Harbour (renamed Keppel Harbour in 
1900) was built in the strait between the southern coast 
of Singapore island and two smaller islands – Pulau 
Brani and Pulau Blakang Mati (present-day Sentosa). The harbour had deep waters, allowing steamships and 
sailing ships to sail right up to it.

from strong winds and big waves by the two smaller

Singapore’s port facilities expanded further in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries, as its trade and industries continued to grow. In 1913, the 
government set up the Singapore Harbour Board (present-day Maritime 
and Port Authority of Singapore [MPA]) to make further improvements to 
the port. New wharves, docks, storehouses and machine shops were built. Modern 
machinery, such as forklifts, cranes and tractors, was used for loading and 
unloading goods. The modernisation of the port was done just in time 
to cope with the increasing world demand for tin and rubber, and the 
rapid opening of plantations in Singapore and Malaya. (See pages 116–119 
for more information on the impact of the growth of the tin and rubber 
industries on Singapore.)
A railway system was also set up to link the port to parts of Malaya. Subsequently, in 1924, the Causeway between Singapore and Malaya was 
opened. Collectively, these changes improved the services provided to ships that 
called at the port. These improvements helped in part to make Singapore 
one of the busiest and most prosperous ports in Asia. The opening of the Causeway, seen here in 1925, 
helped improve links between Singapore and Malaya. Façade of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, c. 1932. The station served as the southern terminus of the

What Impact Did External 
Developments Have on Singapore’s 
Growth as a Port City? In the second half of the 19th century, Singapore’s trade significantly 
expanded due to a number of external developments, in particular, 
the opening of the Suez Canal and the expansion of the tin and rubber 
industries. However, with the onset of the Great Depression in the early 
1930s, Singapore’s trade and industries took a hit. Suez Canal
Opening of the Suez Canal
Prior to the opening of the Suez Canal on 17 November 1869, ships travelling 
between Europe and Asia had to make a long and often dangerous journey 
around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. The journey 
from London to Singapore usually took at least 120 days. This changed with 
the opening of the Suez Canal (see Map 3.2). Not only was the Suez route shorter than the Cape route, the faster  
steamships were increasingly used instead of the slower sailing ships. The 
journey from London to Singapore now only took about 50 days.

Impact of the Opening of the Suez Canal on Singapore
Singapore benefitted greatly from the opening of the Suez Canal in several 
ways. First, it shortened the time needed for people, mail and cargo to 
travel from Europe to Singapore.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 20) ---
This meant lower shipping costs because 
of the savings in distance and time. Second, it increased the volume of ships passing through the Straits of 
Melaka and calling at the port of Singapore to refuel and collect food 
supplies. The Straits of Melaka overtook the Sunda Straits as the main 
route from Europe to the Far East, thus securing Singapore’s dominance  
in the region. Third, it led to the increased use of steamships as sailing ships could not 
use the Suez Canal throughout the year. This enhanced Singapore’s role 
as a coaling station. Despite advances in marine technology, steamships 
travelling long distances had to stop at regular intervals to refuel with huge 
quantities of coal and fresh water. As a result, a series of coaling stations developed along these shipping 
routes from southern Asia, down the Straits of Melaka and into the South 
China Sea. Singapore, as one of these coaling stations, became even more 
important in the trade between Europe and the Asia Pacific region.Apart from the Suez Canal, alternative 
routes across the Pacific and the  
North American continent were 
considered. Among them was the 
Panama Canal route, which was 
opened on 15 August 1914. DID YOU KNOW? Illustration showing a steamship docking at

Tin and Rubber Industries
Expansion of the Tin Industry and Its Impact on Singapore
For most of the 19th century, Singapore’s entrepôt trade relied on  
an extensive and sea-based hinterland 14 that stretched from the  
South China Sea to the Indian Ocean. This trade involved mainly goods 
such as agar-agar, beeswax, opium and tobacco. However, by the end of the 
century, Singapore, with a more clearly defined land-based hinterland in 
Malaya, had gradually become the port from which Malayan commodities 
such as tin and rubber were processed and exported to the rest of  
the world. The expansion of the tin trade was due largely to external developments. First, the spread of British control to parts of Malaya after 1874 led to 
peaceful conditions there. This facilitated the development of tin mining 
and the tin trade. At the same time, the canning industry in the United 
States was expanding, which resulted in a corresponding increase in the 
demand for tin. All this led to the growth of trade between Malaya and the Straits 
Settlements, especially Singapore. This growing trade added a great deal 
to the volume of trade that Singapore was already conducting with other 
parts of the world.

The amount of tin produced in Malaya increased rapidly, partly because of 
the new machinery and new methods of mining that began to be used by 
the Chinese and European miners. In 1874, Malaya was the fourth-largest  
tin producer in the world. By the 1890s, it was producing more than half of 
the world’s tin. From 1890, a large part of Malayan tin was brought to Singapore as tin 
ore, which is tin that has not been purified. At a tin smelting 15 factory 
established by the Straits Trading Company on Pulau Brani, the tin ore was 
smelted and made into blocks of almost 100 per cent pure tin. By the early 
20th century, the factory had become the leading tin smelter in the world. The tin smelting industry and the tin trade brought handsome profits to 
many businessmen in Singapore. They also increased the general prosperity 
of the island. By the end of the 19th century, tin had become the most 
important item of trade among the imports and exports handled by 
Singapore traders. Pineapple canning factory in Singapore,

Expansion of the Rubber Industry and Its Impact  
on Singapore
In the early part of the 20th century, Singapore also exported rubber 
in large quantities. For many years before that, plantation owners had 
shown little interest in growing rubber as an agricultural crop. However, 
this changed when the motor car industry created a new demand for  
rubber tyres. It began in the later part of the 19th century, when the rubber industry took 
an important step forward with John Dunlop’s invention of the pneumatic 
tyre (hollow tyre filled with air). Bicycles could now be fitted with these 
tyres instead of solid tyres. More importantly, the pneumatic tyre made 
possible the rise of the motor car industry. The production of millions of cars in the United States led to a great 
demand for rubber for making tyres.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 26) ---
As the supply of rubber from Brazil 
and Africa was insufficient to meet this demand, the price of rubber shot 
up very quickly. Because of this, planters in Malaya became interested 
in growing rubber on a large scale and hurried to the Singapore Botanic 
Gardens to ask for seeds. This photograph shows a new method of tapping rubber trees without 
damaging the bark, discovered by Henry Ridley in 1897. Turning latex into rubber sheets in Malaya, c. 1900s

Henry Ridley (left) at the Singapore Botanic Gardens 
with one of the rubber trees grown from a batch of 
seedlings from Kew Gardens in London, c. 1905The planters in Malaya were not the only ones who turned to rubber 
planting. European and Chinese traders in Singapore also realised that they 
could make a fortune from the rubber boom by providing capital16 to open 
rubber plantations. Several large European companies in Singapore formed 
rubber companies in England. These new companies in England then sold 
shares (investments by individuals for part ownership of a company) to the 
public in order to obtain the huge capital needed to open up large rubber 
plantations in Malaya. In 1911, the Singapore Chamber of 
Commerce established a Rubber 
Association, which organised sales of 
rubber in Singapore and made it an 
international rubber market. Thus, 
rubber exports from Malaya rose from 
104 tonnes in 1905 to 196,000 tonnes in 
1914. Over the next few years, Malaya 
overtook Brazil as the world’s biggest 
producer of rubber, with most of the 
rubber exported through Singapore. Raw rubber arriving at London Docks, c. 1930s  Loading rubber sheets onto a lorry for transport to a ship, c. 1940s

became the first Director of the 
Singapore Botanic Gardens in 1888. He is most well-known for inventing 
a technique for tapping rubber trees 
without damaging them, which 
extended the trees’ productivity and 
lifespan. Known as “Mad Ridley” or 
“Rubber Ridley” , he repeatedly tried 
to interest European and Chinese 
businessmen to cultivate rubber trees 
as an agricultural crop. His promotion 
of rubber coincided with the invention 
of the pneumatic tyre for motor cars.

Events Leading to the Great Depression
In the early 1930s, Singapore’s trade and industries were hit by the Great Depression.17 Read the illustrated story 
below to find out more about this worldwide event. In the early 1920s, companies in the United States were making 
huge profits and the prices of their shares rose.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 30) ---
Thus, many 
people bought shares as a way to make quick money. But by 1929, many companies were losing money as they were unable  
to sell their goods. As a result, some people decided to sell their shares. This caused share prices to fall, which led more people to sell their shares. Those who had borrowed money to buy 
shares had to sell their belongings to pay 
the banks what they owed. Many tried to 
withdraw their savings, but some banks 
did not have the money to pay them and 
were forced to close down. As a result, 
many people lost their life savings.On 24 October 1929, share prices decreased rapidly. This led 
to the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange located on 
Wall Street. This became known as the Wall Street Crash.Events leading to the GREAT DEPRESSIONEvents leading to the GREAT DEPRESSION

SINGAPORE'S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)17 A depression is a time when there is a great decrease in business activities with many people losing their jobs. The Great 
Depression was so named because of the impact it had on many countries around the world.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 31) ---
With the economic hardship, 
spending on goods fell drastically. The Great Depression was not confined to the United States and had 
an impact on countries that traded with it. Singapore was affected as 
the demand for certain commodities, including tin and rubber, dropped.As companies in the United States were no 
longer making huge profits, they had to cut the 
wages of workers.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 32) ---
Many were also laid off and 
unemployment rose. 121

Impact of the Great Depression on Singapore
Singapore was hit particularly hard as its economy depended largely on 
overseas trade, especially the export of Malayan tin and rubber to the 
United States market. Prior to the Great Depression, prices of tin and 
rubber were very high.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 34) ---
As a result, too much tin and rubber was produced. With the economic depression, the prices of tin and rubber fell drastically 
as the companies that used them closed down. For instance, the price of 
rubber fell from an average of 34 cents in 1929 to 4.95 cents in June 1932. The Great Depression worsened the lives of people in different communities 
in Singapore. Companies suffered losses and had to cut expenses by 
retrenching workers. Many businessmen lost their wealth or became 
bankrupt. There was thus widespread unemployment and hardship. Who were most affected by the Great Depression? How did people cope? Read Source 4 to find out more about the impact of the Great Depression 
on the people in Singapore. Life in Singapore during the Depression was considerably varied. Estate workers, clerks and labourers in the international 
economy suffered more than those in the local economy, such as government employees. Although they were a minority, 
people with stable employment experienced a low cost of living in the early 1930s. Those who took up work as hawkers, 
farmers or tutors could get by if they could survive the increased competition. At the individual level, self-reliance, mutual help and family bonds helped people find work or obtain living expenses, food 
and lodging from family members and friends. The slump was difficult for large families with young and old dependents, 
while life was also painful for sinkehs with few local contacts and lone elderly persons, but their numbers were small due 
to emigration.

 Rubber export coupon, c. 1930s. In order  
to protect the rubber industry during the  
Great Depression, the British imposed

issuing coupons which gave the owners  
the right to export a certain percentage  
of their total rubber production. 1. Based on Source 4, why were some people less affected during the Great Depression than others?LEARN ON THE GO

It became increasingly difficult for people to find 
jobs. Whenever there was a job vacancy, hundreds 
would apply for it. Even the government had to 
cut the number of its workers and reduce the pay 
of those who remained. Many of the unemployed had to depend on 
their friends or relatives.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 37) ---
Many migrants had to 
return to their homelands when their friends and 
relatives could no longer support them. To improve the economic situation, the 
government passed a series of laws from 1928 
to restrict and reduce the number of migrants 
entering Singapore, especially unskilled male 
Chinese labourers. The number of Chinese 
migrants dropped from 242,000 in 1930 to less 
than 28,000 in 1933. The government also arranged 
for large numbers of unemployed Chinese and 
Indians to return to their homelands. By 1934, business conditions in the United States 
and other countries had improved, so exports 
from Singapore began to increase again. Landing permit of a Chinese migrant, 1934 In 1933, a new law was introduced which required new migrants to pay a fee of $5 
to obtain a landing permit (left), which had to be exchanged for a Certificate of  
Admission a month later. An example of a Certificate of Admission for Chinese 
migrants is on the right. 123

 View of the Singapore River where traders and ships first came to Singapore to trade, c. 1920sConclusion
By 1942, Singapore had grown into a busy port city with considerable trading 
networks. Trade was at an all-time high.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 39) ---
This was due to a combination of 
reasons. One was the policies implemented by the British, which provided 
the peace and stability necessary for trade to flourish. For example, the 
British expanded and modernised port facilities, which enabled Singapore 
to handle the increasing volume of trade. External developments, such as 
the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the expansion of the tin and 
rubber industries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, also facilitated 
Singapore’s growth. The migrants, who had come in droves since Singapore’s founding in 1819, 
played a crucial part in helping to develop Singapore as a port city. They 
provided not only trading expertise but also the labour required to build 
up Singapore and its networks of trade. In the following chapter, we will 
look more closely at the contributions of various groups of people who 
came to live and work in Singapore. 124

What has 
changed? What has remained the same? When historians study the past, they use change and 
continuity to describe or compare developments 
in societies across time. Understanding change and 
continuity helps students of history recognise that 
change occurs in different ways (e.g., in terms of 
economic activities and technology) and at different 
paces (e.g., gradual, slow and fast). When things 
remain the same, historians usually refer to them as 
having some form of continuity. Change and continuity 
can also exist together. The images below show how

Prior to Singapore’s transfer to the Colonial Office in 1867, one of the problems faced by the government 
was maintaining law and order. Read the following sources to find out what some of these challenges were. SOURCE AWhy was law and order difficult to maintain in 19th-century Singapore? YearsNumber of People

The secret societies were used by the Chinese to maintain control within their community. It was also a way to regulate 
the contact between the Chinese masses and the British administration.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 48) ---
As a result, the Singapore authorities also found 
themselves making use of the secret societies as an instrument of government. This was because from 1826 to 1877, 
there was no government institution to deal directly with the Chinese population. – Adapted from an account by British anthropologist Maurice Freedman

The Chinese who arrived in the Straits Settlements come from different provinces. The people of each province grouped 
together and formed a secret society. The aim of these secret societies is to offer mutual protection, but they are often 
used to commit crimes. These groups hinder the administration of justice in the law courts of the Straits Settlements. – Adapted from an account of 19th-century Singapore by John Cameron,  
owner and editor of The Straits Times from 1861 to 1881, published in 1865SOURCE C
Weak government, lack of finance, secret society power, and migrants who did not stay long made early Singapore a 
violent place. The hundreds of Chinese who lived on the isolated pepper and gambier farms in the countryside were 
beyond the reach of government.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 50) ---
The authorities did not exert much control in the countryside. Even the town was unsafe. The main danger came from gang robberies, which were reputed to be the work of Chinese secret societies. Gangs of up 
to 200 Chinese raided parts of the town almost every night in the early 1840s. Their chief targets were the Malay districts, 
but they sometimes attacked Indians and Europeans too. The whole town lived in fear, and the tiny police force kept out 
of the way until the gangsters had gone. – Adapted from an account by British historian Constance Mary Turnbull  
of life in Singapore in the early 1840s, published in 2009SOURCE D
The government not only showed an ignorance of Chinese dialects but also had an unconcerned attitude towards 
governing Singapore. During the period of the East India Company’s rule in the Straits Settlements, the primary concern 
of the Straits Settlements government was to increase the importance of Singapore as a trading post. – Adapted from an account by Singaporean historian Eunice Thio of the role played

WHAT ROLE DID THE PEOPLE IN SINGAPORE PLAY IN ITS DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY FROM 1819 TO 1942? FROM ARABIA
The Arabs came 
mainly from 
Hadhramaut in 
southern Arabia 
(southeastern 
part of present-
day Yemen). Many 
came as traders. FROM INDIA AND CEYLON
Most of the people from India 
who came to Singapore were 
Tamils from Madras (present-
day Chennai) and Nagapattinam. There were also Tamils and 
Sinhalese from Ceylon (present-
day Sri Lanka). The migrants 
from northern India comprised 
Punjabis and Sikhs from Punjab, 
Bengalis from Bengal, Gujaratis 
from Gujarat and Parsees from 
Bombay (present-day Mumbai). FROM CHINA
Most of the Chinese who arrived in 
Singapore came from the southern 
provinces of China. The Hokkiens came 
from Fujian; the Cantonese, Teochews 
and Hakkas from Guangdong; and the 
Hainanese from Hainan Island. FROM THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO
The Malays who came to 
Singapore were from the Malay 
Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and 
Celebes (present-day Sulawesi). The Javanese, Baweanese (from 
Bawean Island) and Bugis (from 
Celebes) also came to Singapore. In addition, there were groups 
such as the Eurasians, the Straits-
born Chinese (also known as 
Chinese Peranakans) and the Jawi 
Peranakans. The Eurasians were 
of mixed Asian and Portuguese, 
Dutch or British descent, and were 
mostly from Melaka; the Chinese 
Peranakans were of mixed Chinese 
and Malay descent; and the Jawi 
Peranakans of mixed Indian-Muslim 
and Malay descent. Map 4.1: Map showing the places of origin

Why Did Migrants Come to 
Singapore After 1819? Just as it is today, it was not easy for people in the past to leave their 
homelands and start anew in a foreign land far away. Not only did the 
migrants have to brave the dangers of long-distance travel, such as 
shipwrecks and disease, they also faced much uncertainty about the future 
in the lands where they eventually settled. Thus, for migrants to come to  
Singapore after 1819, they had to have strong reasons for leaving their 
homelands, and Singapore must have had qualities which drew them here. Push Factors
Push factors refer to unfavourable circumstances that motivate people to 
settle elsewhere. Many of the migrants left their homelands because of 
the poor living conditions. Some experienced hunger and poverty while 
others feared for their lives. These problems were often brought about by 
overpopulation, natural disasters or conflict. For example, many in China, 
India and Southeast Asia were affected by the unrest and instability caused 
by wars, rebellions and lawlessness in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The people worried about their families’ and their own safety. It also 
became difficult for them to earn a livelihood.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 66) ---
As a result, they left to 
seek more peaceful and prosperous lives elsewhere. Pull Factors
Pull factors are the favourable conditions that attract people to move to 
a new place. While push factors made people leave their homelands, pull 
factors attracted them to find work in Singapore. The major pull factors 
in the 19th and 20th centuries were trade and business opportunities, and 
better job prospects. Illustration by Vincent Brooks from a British 
newspaper in October 1877 showing both humans  
and animals affected by famine in India

The many trading and business opportunities available in Singapore 
attracted people from Europe, India, China and neighbouring countries. With its excellent geographical location, Singapore served as a convenient 
meeting point for traders from many parts of the world stopping to 
replenish their fuel and food supplies. Taking advantage of its good 
location and trading networks, numerous traders came to Singapore for 
the many diverse goods that could be found and traded. By exchanging 
or selling their goods and buying local products, they were able to obtain 
what they needed and return home. Singapore’s free port status meant that traders did not have to pay taxes 
on trade. This enabled them to make larger profits in Singapore than in 
other ports in the region. Singapore’s free immigration policy allowed migrants to come and go as 
they pleased. They were not required to pay for immigrant passes and 
papers or apply for permission to enter and leave Singapore. This made it 
easier for people from China, India and the surrounding regions to come 
to Singapore. It also meant that traders could come as often as they liked 
for trade and business. Another major pull factor was the availability of better job prospects. Different types of jobs were available because the British needed to 
develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure1 to support the increase 
in port activities and provide for the growing population who had started 
coming in increasing numbers since Singapore’s founding. Singapore was also an attractive option for the poorer migrants because 
they could receive higher wages than what they received back home. Since 
they could come and go freely because of the free immigration policy, 
many did not see Singapore as a permanent home and planned to return 
to their homelands after earning enough money. Cavenagh Bridge, c.

When historians study the past, they need to look at various experiences 
faced by different people. This is because people may have different 
experiences even if they live in the same place during the same time. Studying similarities and differences in people’s experiences helps 
historians develop a more complete understanding of the past. People’s experiences could be influenced by their occupations. Consider the entrepreneurs,2 labourers and craftsmen in Singapore in 
the 19th and early 20th centuries. How would their work have shaped 
their experiences? How similar or different would their lives have been? 2 An entrepreneur is a person who sets up a business, taking on financial risks in the hope of making a profit. 3 A commission refers to the fee for the service of selling a good.

It is usually a percentage of the cost of the good. What Were the Occupations of  
the Different Groups of Migrants? Upon arriving in Singapore, one of the first concerns for the migrants was 
to secure their livelihoods to survive in Singapore. The hope of earning and 
saving enough to return in prosperity to their homelands was also on their 
minds. In fact, many migrants simply took up the same trade or occupation 
they had before coming to Singapore. Others, such as the coolies, had 
signed contracts to take up a job even before they left home. Regardless 
of where they came from, Singapore offered an opportunity for migrants 
to improve their lives. Hand-coloured print of Edwin Augustus Porcher’s

Entrepreneurs
Traders
When Singapore was founded, the first group of people who came were 
the traders.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 72) ---
Many traders were attracted by the favourable trade policies. These traders engaged in commercial activities along the Singapore River. Boat Quay became the busiest part of the river, with many shophouses 
and warehouses lining the riverbank. Some Europeans also set up agency houses3 here. In return for their services, 
they received a commission.4 Some of these agency houses include A. L. Johnston & Company (established in 1820 by Alexander Laurie Johnston) 
and Boustead & Company (established in 1828 by Edward Boustead).Upon his death in 1888, Boustead left  
a sum of money to construct a building 
for sailors living in Singapore. The 
building, named after Boustead, was 
opened in 1892 by the Governor of the 
Straits Settlements. In the late 1970s, 
it was demolished for port expansion 
works. DID YOU KNOW? Boustead Institute on Anson Road,  
early 20th century
3 Agency houses were companies that helped European manufacturers to sell their goods, such as opium and tea, to other 
traders in exchange for goods from Southeast Asia, such as spices and birds’ nests. 4 A commission refers to the fee for the service of selling a good. It is usually a percentage of the cost of the good. 141

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 73) ---
The Europeans who set up the agency houses often had difficulty dealing 
with Asian traders because of their differences in language. Thus, the 
Chinese Peranakans, who could speak English, Malay and Chinese dialects, 
played a significant role in facilitating communication between the 
European and Asian traders. Several Chinese Peranakans even set up their own trading businesses  
in Singapore. Among them was Melakan-born Tan Kim Seng, who became 
one of the most well-known members of the Chinese community during 
the colonial period. Apart from the European agency houses and Chinese traders, many 
traders from various parts of the Malay Archipelago were also attracted 
by Singapore’s free port status. One trader who arrived in the 1800s was 
Melakan-born Hajjah Fatimah Sulaiman. Having lost her husband at a young 
age, she continued and expanded his business in Singapore, gaining great 
wealth in the process. Yet another trader who came shortly after Singapore’s founding was 
Naraina Pillai. He was an Indian trader from Penang who started a factory 
in Singapore to produce bricks. He also had a cotton cloth business, which 
later grew to become one of the largest in Singapore. Other Indian traders, 
particularly from Penang, soon followed. By the early 1870s, there were 
substantial numbers of Indian traders, including Wassiamull Assomull. He 
was a textile trader with extensive trading connections outside of India 
and became very prosperous by the end of the 19th century.

The Bugis were also attracted by Singapore’s free port status. They had 
been trading in the region long before the Europeans arrived. However, 
after the Dutch took control of the East Indies and its trade routes, they 
imposed taxes on traders. This affected the spice trade of the Bugis, who 
traditionally used these trade routes. When Singapore became a free port, 
it thus attracted vast numbers of Bugis ships. By the beginning of the 20th 
century, several hundred Bugis traders and their families had moved to 
Singapore. One of the most prominent Bugis traders was Haji Omar Ali, who 
arrived in Singapore from the Dutch East Indies in 1880 and subsequently 
owned many properties in Singapore. His youngest son, Haji Ambo Sooloh, 
expanded his father’s business and later became one of the founders of 
the Malay newspaper Utusan Melayu (Malay Messenger) in 1939. Kampong Bugis, one of the places where the Bugis settled after they landed in Singapore, c.

in 1819. They originally came from 
the southwestern peninsula of Celebes 
(present-day Sulawesi in Indonesia). The Bugis were an important seafaring 
people in Southeast Asia who were 
well known for their maritime trading 
and boatbuilding skills. When they 
first landed in Singapore, they settled 
in Kampong Glam, Kampong Bugis 
and later Kampong Rochor (the area 
around present-day Lavender MRT 
station). Landmarks such as Bugis 
Street and Bugis MRT station are 
reminders of the Bugis’ links to these 
areas. Bugis sailor aboard his ship, 1950s

Syed Omar bin Ali Aljunied donated 
one of his many plots of land for the 
building of St Andrew’s Church (now 
known as St Andrew’s Cathedral) in 
1823. Later, he also donated land to  
Tan Tock Seng in 1844 for the 
construction of a hospital for the  
poor, known as Tan Tock Seng 
Hospital today.DID YOU KNOW? The presence of the Bugis in Singapore in turn attracted Arab and Indian 
traders from the Middle East and India.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 78) ---
This was due to the Bugis’ close ties 
with the Arab and Indian trade networks in Southeast Asia. The Arabs were also attracted to Singapore as a commercial entrepôt. Many of the Arabs in Southeast Asia originated from Hadhramaut  
in southern Arabia. They had been active traders in Southeast Asia since 
the 7th century. Among the first Arab traders to arrive in Singapore shortly after its 
founding were Syed Omar bin Ali Aljunied and his uncle, Syed Mohammed 
bin Harun (Haroon) Aljunied, two wealthy Hadhrami Arabs from Sumatra. They were soon followed by numerous others who set sail from parts of 
Malaya, Sumatra and Java. In the latter part of the 19th century, another wave of Arabs came from 
Hadhramaut to Singapore. This included the Alkaff brothers, Ahmad and 
Abdul, who established their company, Alkaff & Company, in the 1860s. This was partly due to the increased use of steamships and the opening 
of the Suez Canal in 1869 (see Chapter 3), which made the journey easier. Records show that in the 1880s, there were as many as 800 Arabs living 
in Singapore, mainly concentrated in the area around Arab, Baghdad, 
Bussorah, Jeddah and Muscat Streets. By the 1930s, the Arab community 
had become one of the largest property owners in Singapore, with  
an estimated 80 per cent of the Arabs’ primary income coming from rent. The Alkaff Arcade, the first indoor shopping centre in Singapore when it opened in 1909, at

Street Traders
Another group of traders were street traders. There were many different 
types of street traders. Food traders, who sold quick and cheap meals to 
the coolies and other workers, formed the largest group. There were also 
small-scale farmers, fishermen and hunters who sold food products they 
had grown or caught in the streets and markets. Yet another group of street 
traders sold items such as sandals, brooms and towels, while street barbers 
and cobblers, who provided haircutting and shoe-mending services to the 
community, made up the last group of street traders. Indian bread seller, c.

Moneylenders
As Singapore grew as an entrepôt, it attracted Indians skilled in trade, 
accounting, banking and credit. These skills were in high demand due to 
the commercial activities carried out in the port city. One particularly influential group was the Chettiars, or Indian  
moneylenders. They arrived from the 1820s onwards and 
operated in the Singapore River area. Different groups of traders 
would borrow money from these moneylenders as very few 
banks would lend them money. In this way, the Chettiars 
contributed to Singapore’s commercial importance. 145

Labourers
Male Coolies
Labourers, or coolies, made up a large group of the migrants. Many 
were Chinese men who came to Singapore in the latter half of  
the 19th century. They provided much-needed labour as workers were 
needed to load and unload goods at the ports, and carry goods to and 
from boats and warehouses situated along the Singapore River. There were 
also large numbers of Indian labourers recruited to the Straits Settlements, 
especially from 1867 to 1941, to help in the development of the port city. These labourers worked at the various plantations in Singapore and Malaya, 
and helped to build roads, railways and harbour facilities. Coolies were also heavily involved in coaling, or the loading of coal onto 
steamships, which was a messy and tiring job. This was an essential service 
required by major shipping companies. The coolies’ hard work helped 
Singapore gain a reputation for efficiency. As trade grew, more coolies were brought in. In addition to their work 
at the ports, they were employed in construction work while others 
cleared land for plantations. Some became rickshaw pullers, who played 
an important role in providing an inexpensive means of transport for a 
wide range of people, such as European businessmen, local street traders 
and even school-going children. Chinese migrant workers at a rubber plantation, late 19th century. The original photograph was in black and white.

Life as a rickshaw puller was very 
tough. The job was physically 
demanding as each coolie had to carry 
a few hundred kilograms of weight 
every day to various parts of the city. Rickshaw pullers also faced occasional 
danger as some were stabbed or beaten 
to death for either moving too slowly 
or protesting over the underpayment 
of the agreed fees for the rickshaw ride. For a day’s work, each rickshaw  
puller earned around 30 to 40 cents. To make ends meet, many had to take 
on additional jobs either as labourers 
or shop workers.DID YOU KNOW? 146

Convict Labourers
From 1825 to 1873, the main source of labour for public works in Singapore 
was Indian convicts brought over by the British. Due to the scarcity of labour in the new colony, there was plenty of work 
for the convicts. They were tasked to clear jungles, sweep the streets, 
lay the earliest roads, tend the town’s gardens and parks, and construct 
buildings. Some notable roads and buildings constructed by Indian convict labourers 
include High Street, the first street in Singapore, and many of the important 
government buildings there. The nearby St Andrew’s Church (now known 
as St Andrew’s Cathedral) was also built by convict labourers trained  
in construction work. Indian convicts who came to Singapore 
were divided into six different classes. For example, there was a small group 
of convicts (male and female) who 
were employed in hospitals and public 
offices.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 86) ---
Some of these convicts brought 
with them specialist knowledge. For example, Bawajee Rajaram from 
Bombay (present-day Mumbai) drew 
plans for public buildings such as the 
St Andrew’s Cathedral. Convicts were 
also engaged in varied tasks from 
making bricks to taking photographs

Craftsmen
Boatmakers
Some communities, such as the Bugis, were engaged in boatmaking. The Bugis were skilled in building ships and boats that Malay traders used 
to ferry goods to neighbouring islands. They thus established a thriving 
shipbuilding industry and Bugis trading vessels, such as the phinisi (sailing 
ships), could be found transporting goods along the Singapore River. Artist’s impression of a fleet of Bugis phinisi.

Now that you know what the various communities did in Singapore, what 
do you think life was like for them? Read the following sources to find out 
more about how they felt after arriving in Singapore in the 19th and early 
20th centuries. On my first day of arrival in Singapore as a child, I felt like I was a fish out of water.* Everything was new to me. I couldn’t 
understand people who talked to me because they sounded different.

They were all speaking with a different accent, 
which was different from mine. The people living here also spoke a mixture of Malay words with their own languages. I could not understand what they were saying. I could not understand sentences such as “ Lu suka ki pasar bo?”.†
The people here were so different. Among the Chinese, there were people from different provinces who spoke different 
dialects that were completely different from mine, such as the Hainanese. Then there were also so many other races, 
speaking languages I had never heard, and wearing different clothes. – Adapted from an account by Low Cheng Gin, whose family was forced by bandit attacks to leave  
his village in China in 1925. He had never left his village before coming to Singapore at the age of 10. * “A fish out of water” is a phrase indicating a person is away from his or her usual environment. † The sentence is a mix of Hokkien and Malay, and means “Do you like to go to the market?”.SOURCE 1

It was very difficult to get a job in the early 1930s, unless you had a lot of experience and recommendations from 
friends. I got a job eventually only because one of my friends recommended me to the Singapore Traction Company. Otherwise, I couldn’t get one because everywhere you went, you would see a “NO VACANCY” signboard. I was quite 
disappointed, you know. My uncle told me, “If you come to Singapore, you can easily get a job, you know.” But when  
I came here I could not find any jobs. – Adapted from an account by Palanivelu Natesan, who came to Singapore in June 1930 during the Great Depression. Natesan eventually found work as a clerk with the Singapore Traction Company and later worked as a radio broadcasting assistant. 150

Singapore is certainly the most convenient city I ever saw, as well planned and carefully executed as though built entirely 
by one man. It is like a big desk, full of drawers and pigeonholes, where everything has its place, and can always be found 
in it. For instance, around the Esplanade [present-day Padang], you find the European hotels; around Commercial Square 
[present-day Raffles Place] are all the shipping offices, warehouses, and shops of the European traders; and along Boat 
Quay are all the ship chandlers [people who deal in supplies and equipment for ships]. Nearby, you will find a dozen 
large Chinese medicine shops, cloth shops, tin shops, and shops kept by blacksmiths, tailors and carpenters. There are 
also people selling fruit, vegetables and grain. Owing to this peculiar grouping of the different trades, one can do more 
business in less time in Singapore than in any other town in the world. – Adapted from an account by American zoologist William Temple Hornaday,  
who spent two years travelling around India, Sri Lanka, the Malay Peninsula, Singapore  
and Borneo collecting animal specimens. This account was taken from his book,

What Educational Opportunities 
and Healthcare Services Were 
Provided by the Migrants? The promotion of trade was the main priority for the British authorities in 
Singapore. Thus, the welfare of the general population was not a primary 
focus of the British. Healthcare services and educational opportunities 
provided by the British were therefore inadequate to meet the needs 
of the people. In response, some migrants helped fund educational and 
healthcare provisions for the larger community in Singapore. Education
In Chapter 3, you learnt that the British only ran schools that supported 
their economic interests and to fill certain government positions.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 98) ---
They 
provided few other educational opportunities even till the early part of 
the 20th century. Various people and organisations thus stepped in to fill 
the gap, establishing schools that benefitted their communities. Prior to 1900, schools were largely intended for boys. There were very 
few schools for girls, except those run by Christian missions that took  
in orphaned and homeless girls. For example, Maria Dyer, an English 
missionary, started one of the earliest schools for such girls. Originally 
called Chinese Girls’ School, then later Church of England Zenana 
Missionary School (present-day St Margaret’s School), it began as a home 
for young Chinese girls rescued by the police before they could be sold 
off. Read Source 4 to find out more about it. St Margaret’s School, Singapore’s oldest school for girls, was established in 1842 by missionary Maria Dyer. It began as 
a missionary effort to save mui tsai (“little sister” in Cantonese), or bonded domestic servants.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 99) ---
In 1842, Maria and her 
husband, Samuel Dyer of the London Missionary Society, were transiting in Singapore on their way to do missionary work 
in China when Maria was moved by the plight of these girls. So she obtained permission to house these homeless girls 
and began the work of teaching these girls English, the Christian faith and home economics. It was the first school for girls 
in Singapore established in a time when the education of women was considered unimportant. – Adapted from an online account of Singapore’s oldest school for girls SOURCE 4

Wealthy Chinese traders also built schools to provide Chinese education 
in Singapore. Among them was Tan Kim Seng, who opened two Hokkien 
schools, one near Thian Hock Keng Temple in Telok Ayer Street and the 
other in Amoy Street. Another Chinese trader, Gan Eng Seng, founded the Anglo-Chinese Free 
School (present-day Gan Eng Seng School) in 1885. At that time, it was 
the only school in Singapore that taught both Chinese and English. In 
the Chinese schools, the teachers would use dialects such as Hokkien, 
Cantonese and Teochew to teach students to recite passages from Chinese 
literature. Students also learnt to write letters and to use the abacus. Other Chinese businessmen and organisations also started building schools 
in the 20th century. For example, in 1915, the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan 
established a school for girls called Chong Hock Girls’ School (present-
day Chongfu School) that was situated beside Thian Hock Keng Temple 
on Telok Ayer Street. The first Chinese secondary school for boys – the 
Chinese High School (present-day Hwa Chong Institution) – was started by 
a group of rich businessmen led by Tan Kah Kee in 1919. Some Malay schools were also built by wealthy individuals in the early  
20th century. For example, the Alsagoff Arab School (Madrasah Alsagoff  
Al-Arabiah) was founded in 1912 with the help of Syed Mohamed bin Ahmed 
Alsagoff. Students were taught Arabic language and Islamic knowledge as 
well as reading and writing in English and Malay. Schools were also set up by organisations such as the Ramakrishna Mission 
in the early 20th century. For example, they established schools that taught 
students in both English and Tamil. Some other schools, such as Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus, Raffles 
Institution and St Joseph’s Institution, were also set up in the 19th century 
by various individuals and organisations.

Healthcare 
Lack of nutrition, poor sanitation and overcrowding meant that diseases 
such as malaria, cholera, typhoid, smallpox and tuberculosis were common 
among migrants. Many of the sick lay on the road with sores on their 
bodies, too weak to move. When they died, their bodies were left on  
the roads. The government did little to provide healthcare and related social services 
for the public.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 107) ---
Thus, various local groups took it upon themselves to 
develop self-help organisations instead of relying on the government to 
address this issue. For example, Gan Eng Seng, whom we read about earlier, 
led the establishment of Thong Chai Medical Institution in the latter part 
of the 19th century. This institution ran a clinic to give free treatment and 
free medicine to poor people of all races. The former Thong Chai Medical Institution

The poor and sick were given little access to medical treatment. Tan, 
an immigrant of Fujian descent from Melaka who became a wealthy trader in Singapore, offered to donate $5,000 to set 
up a hospital for the poor. On 25 May 1844, the foundation stone for Tan’s hospital was laid on Pearl’s Hill. The hospital 
was first called Chinese Pauper* Hospital. It was later named Tan Tock Seng Hospital. – Adapted from an online description of the establishment of a paupers’ hospital in Singapore

How Did the Migrants Participate  
in Making Laws for Singapore? In the early years of Singapore’s establishment, all decisions were made by 
the British for the people in Singapore. Most migrants were not interested 
in having a say in how Singapore was governed since they were not thinking 
of staying in Singapore for long. Nevertheless, over time, some migrants 
participated in making laws that helped make Singapore a better place to 
work and live in. Local Involvement in the Government
In Chapter 3, you saw that after 1867, the government in Singapore was 
headed by a Governor who ruled with the help of an Executive Council 
and a Legislative Council. Look at Figure 4.3 below, which shows the 
composition of the Legislative Council in 1869, comprising the Governor, 
eight official members and five non-official members.5

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 112) ---
For many years, the non-official members of the Legislative Council 
consisted of only a few European and Asian traders. As they were 
outnumbered by the official members (comprising only Europeans), 
and so could be outvoted, it was very difficult for them to persuade 
the government to act on their suggestions. This made the non-official 
members unhappy. Over the years, there was pressure on the government to increase their 
numbers. By 1924, the number of non-official members had increased, with 
an equal number of non-official and official members in the Legislative 
Council. This was also a step towards getting more local people involved 
in the affairs of the colony. Asian non-official members such as Dr Lim Boon Keng and Eunos Abdullah 
proposed laws that were passed by the Legislative Council. For example, in 
1927, Eunos Abdullah asked the government to set aside a very large piece 
of land for a Malay settlement called Kampong Melayu. The settlement 
subsequently provided low-cost housing for the Malays and allowed them 
to earn a living by growing fruit and vegetables as well as rearing poultry. Scene showing residents at Kampong Melayu in 1935. The residents are celebrating the 25th anniversary of

? Who was  
EUNOS ABDULLAH? ?Dr Lim Boon Keng (1869–1957) 
was born into a family of Chinese 
Peranakans in Singapore. He was the 
first Chinese to be awarded the Queen’s 
Scholarship (now known as the 
President’s Scholarship) in 1887. He studied medicine in Edinburgh. After returning to Singapore in 1893,  
he opened a dispensary (pharmacy) to 
treat patients suffering from cholera. Apart from his involvement in the 
Legislative Council, he also launched 
campaigns to fight opium use in 
Singapore and played a role in the 
development of Chinese and English 
education for young Chinese. Eunos Abdullah (1876–1933), the son 
of a Sumatran trader, was one of  
a select few Malay boys to attend  
Raffles Institution at that time. He worked in Johor after his studies, 
then returned in 1907 to Singapore, 
where he was responsible for editing 
a new Malay-language newspaper 
called Utusan Melayu .

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 114) ---
He later 
became the first Malay and only 
Muslim representative appointed by 
the colonial government to sit on the 
Straits Settlements Legislative Council 
in 1924. However, there were times when proposals by Asian leaders were  
rejected by the Legislative Council. One example is the ban on opium 
proposed by Dr Lim Boon Keng from 1895 onwards. Read the illustrated 
story on the next page to find out what happened. 161

Dr Lim Boon Keng wanted opium 
smoking to be banned as he saw 
how it had destroyed many Chinese 
migrants’ lives. He spoke about the 
evils of opium smoking both in and 
outside the Legislative Council.The Legislative Council was unwilling to  
ban opium as it would mean a great loss  
of income for the government. To make up for the possible loss of income for the 
government, the Governor at that time, Sir John Anderson, 
asked the Legislative Council to pass a law to tax people’s 
salaries and profits from their businesses.Many members in the Legislative Council 
opposed the income tax law as it would 
greatly reduce their incomes.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 116) ---
Due to the fierce opposition, the 
income tax law was not passed. Opium 
was not banned and the government 
continued to obtain a large part of its 
income from opium until the Japanese

British Attitudes Towards the Locals
As we read earlier, local non-official members such as Dr Lim Boon Keng  
and Eunos Abdullah used their influence to persuade the colonial 
government to increase the number of local non-official members in the 
Legislative Council and introduce proposals to help the local people. Some 
of these local non-official members also formed associations such as the 
Straits Chinese British Association and the Kesatuan Melayu Singapura 
(Singapore Malay Union) to improve the lives of the people. Though there were attempts to involve some of the locals in making 
laws, the British rulers did not treat the Asians as equals. They believed 
that British culture was superior, and that they had the responsibility of 
“civilising” those they ruled. This belief in British superiority was reflected 
in how Singapore was governed. Most of the high-ranking officials in  
the colonial government were British. Even well-qualified locals were not 
given important positions in the government. Most of the Europeans in Singapore were also given privileged treatment. Read Source 6 to find out more.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 118) ---
There were other instances of privileged treatment. For example, the 
railway department discouraged Asians from travelling in first-class 
carriages. In certain hotels, Asians were not allowed to use the dance floor 
or the bar as these were reserved solely for Europeans. I called Mr Tan Ah Hung, a senior Chinese teacher, “Sir”, when I spoke to him, until I was advised that this embarrassed 
him in the kind of world we lived in. My starting salary of $400 was far higher than his even though he had many years  
of most valued service. Salary and skin colour were what mattered, not personal merit and achievement. – Adapted from an account by Francis Thomas, a British teacher  
at St Andrew’s School in Singapore in the 1930sSOURCE 6

Conclusion
From the outset, Singapore flourished because of a number of reasons. Among them, the policies of free trade and free immigration established 
by the British helped Singapore develop considerably. These two policies 
led to the arrival of different groups of migrants, who played an important 
role in developing the port city. News of Singapore’s establishment as a free port in the centre of a rich 
area of trade spread quickly. By 1824, the population had reached about 
11,000 due to the influx of migrants. The migrants came to Singapore for various reasons.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 120) ---
Many left their 
homelands because of poor living conditions. They were also attracted to  
Singapore, which offered better job prospects and trading opportunities. Most came with one thought in mind: to earn as much money as they could 
in the shortest possible time and take it away with them. In doing so, they 
helped develop Singapore as a port city. These included the enterprising 
traders from different parts of the world who used Singapore as a base to 
build their trading networks in the region. The labourers from China, India 
and the surrounding areas also toiled behind the scenes, building many 
parts of Singapore that enabled it to thrive as a port city. View of Singapore from a poster of a French movie

As Singapore grew into a vibrant port city, some groups of people 
prospered. They provided money and land to help improve the lives of the 
people in Singapore in various areas, including education, healthcare and 
law-making. Together with the British rulers and external developments, 
which you read about in Chapter 3, the various communities helped 
Singapore flourish. However, Singapore’s success was disrupted when the Japanese attacked 
at the end of 1941. Find out more about why Singapore fell to the Japanese

British rule in Singapore created a stable and successful society based on trade, commerce and immigration. Thus, the port city developed many trade networks with different countries. This resulted in an increasing 
number of migrants arriving from China, India, the Malay Archipelago and other places around the world. Apart from shipping, goods and people, ideas also started coming into Singapore from various parts of 
the world. Read the following sources to find out the ways in which Singapore became a centre for the 
exchange and spread of ideas before 1942.In what ways was Singapore considered a centre for  
the exchange and spread of ideas before 1942? By the end of the 19th century, Singapore was developing into a 
regional intellectual hub * for the various local communities. It 
was also becoming a regional printing and publishing hub. This 
development grew out of the availability of printing presses and 
trained pressmen, introduced by Christian missionaries as early as 
1823. The earliest Singapore-printed books bore the imprint of Mission 
Press or Institution Press. The oldest surviving Japanese version of 
any portion of the Bible was published in Singapore in 1837. The earliest Malay publications were religious texts, as were the early 
Tamil works. Among the early newspapers published and printed in 
Singapore were Jawi Peranakkan (1876), and Chinese papers such 
as Tifang Jih Pau (Local News, 1845) and Jit Sheng (Rising Sun, 
1858). Among the earliest printed books was Munshi Abdullah’s  
Hikayat Abdullah (1849). The demand for Malay reading materials, which were also read by 
literate Straits Chinese, led to a thriving translation industry of both 
Chinese and English classics. – Adapted from a description of 19th-century Singapore

Singapore’s reputation as a centre of Islamic life and learning in the late 19th century was widespread. This reputation 
rested on its position as key stopover for pilgrims† and Arab migrants. It also became a publication and distribution 
centre for Islamic religious writings. Students from all over the Malay Archipelago wishing to further their studies  
in Islamic studies went either to Mecca or to the Straits Settlements, where they studied with scholars, most of whom had 
studied in Mecca. – Adapted from an account by British historian William Roff of the influence  
of ideas on Singapore from the late 19th century, published in 1967

In the early years of their move, their ties with China, the country 
they had left, remained strong. In the early part of the 20th century, Singapore became a suitable place for raising money to support political activities 
in China. In the 1930s, many of the activities by some Chinese organisations were stopped by the British, and on occasion 
their leaders jailed for threatening the peace of the community. – Adapted from an account by Jim Baker,

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)In Chapter 2, you learnt that historians often examine the causes of key historical events. This is not always 
a straightforward matter.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 139) ---
Related events do not necessarily take place one after another, and one event 
does not always lead to another. To really understand how a historical event came about, historians have to 
examine the possible causes from different angles. One useful way is to look at them in terms of:
• the broader context or setting (e.g., physical, political, economic, social, cultural, military) in which  
the event took place;
• the immediate or local circumstances of the event (e.g., whether people were unhappy or prepared to 
act, the weather on the day of the event); and
• the roles of key historical actors (individuals who made major decisions that contributed to the historical 
event). Besides looking at causes separately, it is also useful to look at how different causes might have interacted 
with one another. Keep this in mind as you read about the fall of Singapore during World War II in this 
chapter. Historical Actors

Why Did War Break Out in the Asia Pacific in 1941? To understand why World War II began and spread to the Asia Pacific, we must look at what happened before 
that. In the 1920s, the British Empire was the largest in the world, comprising over a quarter of the world’s land 
area and population. However, in the 1930s, two rising countries, Germany and Japan, began to pose serious 
threats to the British Empire and to international peace, as illustrated below:
The economy was in ruins and there was great hardship. In these circumstances, Adolf Hitler 
and his Nazi Party rose to power.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 141) ---
They wanted to make Germany  
a great power again, and hence won 
the support of many Germans. They rebuilt the German 
military into something 
more powerful than before. By the late 1930s, it seemed as if Germany 
was getting ready for another war.* A great power is a very strong country that can dominate or influence other countries.After World War I, Germany lost its status as a great power. *

From the 17th to mid-19th centuries, 
Japan had kept to itself. Foreigners were banned, except at a few trading ports.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 143) ---
The Japanese realised that they had 
fallen far behind the Western countries.Everything changed in 1853, when warships from the 
United States arrived. The United States wanted Japan 
to open more ports and increase trade between them. To catch up, Japan had to change. In less than 50 years, Japan became a modern, industrialised country. 176

To do this, the Japanese set out to build their own 
empire in Asia, which would give them the land and 
resources they needed.

This would eventually bring Japan into 
conflict with Britain and the United States.However, being a mountainous and heavily forested 
country, Japan lacked natural resources of its own.At the same time, Japan had ambitions

Towards the end of the 1930s, the international situation deteriorated drastically. Large-scale conflict broke out 
both in Europe and in Asia.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 147) ---
These developments had important implications for the security of Britain and its 
empire overseas, as shown below:
Having rebuilt the German military, Hitler 
planned to make Germany even more powerful. Soon, Germany began taking over 
some of its neighbouring countries. Britain was the only country left in 
Western Europe opposing Germany.On the other side of the world, 
in Asia, the drums of war were 
also beating more loudly. In 1937, Japan invaded China. To force the Japanese out of China, the 
United States stopped selling oil to Japan.Japan would not withdraw from China. But it was 
desperate for oil to keep its industries going. GERMANY

The worsening situation in Europe and the Asia Pacific during the 1930s meant the British had to make some 
difficult choices. They had to weigh the defence of the British homeland against the defence of its widespread 
overseas empire. Ultimately, defending Britain itself was more important. As we shall see later, this decision 
had an impact on British plans for defending Malaya and Singapore, and the actual forces available to resist the 
Japanese invasion. Southeast Asia was a possible solution to 
Japan’s problems.

other useful resources such as tin and rubber. Only one country stood in Japan’s way. That was the 
United States, with its powerful naval fleet stationed at 
Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. In December 1941, the 
Japanese navy attacked 
Pearl Harbor, putting much 
of the United States naval 
forces in the Pacific out of

in southern Thailand and northern Malaya. World War II had

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)Was Singapore Really an 
“Impregnable Fortress”? By the late 1930s, Singapore had come to be thought of by many people 
as an “impregnable fortress”.1 How did this come about? Was Singapore 
really such an “impregnable fortress”? British Defence Plans
The Rising Threat of Japan
During the 1920s, the British realised that Japan was a possible threat to 
their empire in the Far East. This was because Japan had ambitions to 
create its own empire in Asia. In particular, Singapore and Malaya were 
important targets, as they would give Japan access to the rich natural 
resources of Southeast Asia and control over the vital shipping route of 
the Straits of Melaka. Malaya’s tin and rubber would support Japanese  
industries and war production, while Singapore’s port and important 
location made it an ideal base for Japanese attacks on the Dutch East Indies 
(present-day Indonesia) and possibly even Australia. Conquering Singapore 
would also be a great boost to Japan’s national pride. The “Singapore Strategy”
Given the importance of Malaya and Singapore, the British had to make 
preparations to defend them against the rising threat of Japan. However, 
Britain had been exhausted by World War I and the British public were 
unwilling to keep up military spending after the horrible experience of the 
war. As a result, British power had declined and Britain was no longer able 
to maintain a large permanent military force to protect its colonies in Asia. To solve this problem, the British decided to construct a large, modern naval 
base in Asia. Singapore was chosen as the site because of its geographical 
location and importance as a port. In the event of a war, Britain would send 
a fleet of warships to the base to protect its large overseas empire. While 
the fleet was on its way, Singapore would have to rely on local defences 
built by the British. This plan became known as the “Singapore strategy”.2 Map 5.1: Territories occupied or controlled by

After the British set up a trading post 
in Singapore in 1819, the question 
of how to defend it arose. However, 
little was done until the outbreak of 
war between Russia and Britain in 
1854.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 151) ---
Fort Canning was built in 1860, 
but turned out to be inadequate for 
defence purposes. It was not until after  
World War I that Singapore began  
to have stronger defences.DID YOU KNOW? 1 A fortress is a place or building set up for defence against enemy attacks. The key features include strong walls, gun positions, 
underground bunkers (shelters), and the presence of a large number of troops. Singapore was known as an “impregnable fortress” 
because it was thought to be very difficult, if not impossible, for an enemy to conquer. 2 A strategy is a broad, general, long-term plan to achieve one or more objectives.

Sembawang, an area in northern 
Singapore, was chosen as the 
location for the naval base. By 1941, 
the naval base and its defences were 
completed: military airfields were 
constructed at Tengah, Sembawang 
and Seletar, and gun positions were 
set up to defend Singapore against 
attacks from the sea (see Map 5.2). NKallang Airport, opened in 1937,  
was originally built as a civil airport.

decreased, even as the international situation worsened in the 1930s.The completion of the naval base and its accompanying defences led many 
people to believe that Singapore was an “impregnable fortress” .

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 156) ---
However, 
the “Singapore strategy” turned out to be unrealistic. For example, it was 
initially assumed that the situation in Europe would remain peaceful so 
that a powerful fleet of warships could be sent to Singapore if necessary. As it happened, that was not possible because of the rise of Nazi 
Germany and the subsequent outbreak of World War II in Europe. Britain 
needed all the defences it had to protect itself. THE “SINGAPORE STRATEGY”

In order for the “Singapore strategy” to work, the naval base had to be 
defended until the British war fleet arrived. However, the British began 
to realise that the defence of Singapore and the naval base was linked 
to the defence of Malaya. Singapore could not be held if Malaya was 
lost. Thus, defending Malaya became an issue of importance to British  
military planners. At first, the British thought that Singapore could not be attacked from  
the north. They believed it was difficult to land troops in Malaya during the 
monsoon and advance through the thick jungles. Hence, when the British 
built the naval base in Singapore, they put in place defences to protect it 
from sea attacks from the south and the east but not from an attack from 
Malaya in the north (see Map 5.2 on page 181). The naval base, its defences, 
and the natural protection of the Malayan jungles led the British to believe 
that Singapore was as strong as a fortress. By the 1930s, British military commanders in Malaya realised that their 
assumptions were untrue.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 158) ---
With improved equipment, troops could land 
in Malaya even during the wet and windy monsoon season. Furthermore, 
with the construction and improvement of roads and railways, an army 
could move through Malaya without going through the jungle. 183

conquering Johor could launch air and artillery attacks on the naval base without 
having to invade Singapore itself!DID YOU KNOW? Given all these developments, it became clear to the British that it was 
essential to defend Malaya from hostile attacks. They drew up plans to 
prevent an enemy army from landing in northern Malaya. Military airfields 
were built in many parts of Malaya to provide bases for aircraft to defend 
it from hostile landings. In this way, the British hoped to deter potential 
enemies from invading their colonies. Pilots running to their planes at Sembawang Airfield in Singapore, c.

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)Here is an example of how to compare sources using these steps. Example
Noel is studying the fall of Singapore during World War II. He wants to answer a question on Singapore’s 
defences. He goes to the archives and finds two relevant sources (Sources 1 and 2 below). How should Noel 
compare the sources? They [the British] talked about Singapore as an 
impregnable fortress. Some called it the Gibraltar of the 
East.* As far as I knew … they had a lot of big guns here 
… and they had concrete beach defences … I thought the 
defence was quite good. – Adapted from an account by Ismail bin Zain,  
a clerk in Singapore in the 1930s
* Gibraltar, a British overseas territory in Europe, was heavily 
fortified due to its important location. It was considered difficult 
to conquer partly because it was surrounded by high cliffs and 
the sea. Singapore was sometimes referred to as the Gibraltar 
of the East to indicate that Singapore was also heavily fortified. No one should have been fooled by the legend of the 
mighty fortress of Singapore. The place had none of 
the natural characteristics of an old time fortress like 
Gibraltar; nor was it “fortified” in any way, though it 
had been armed with guns which were useless against 
anything but a sea-borne assault. – Adapted from an account written after the war by  
C.

A. Vlieland, who was Secretary of Defence in the  
Singapore government from 1939 to 1941SOURCE 1 SOURCE 2
The question that Noel wants to answer is “Was 
Singapore really a fortress?”. So he reads Sources 1 
and 2 to find what they say about whether Singapore 
was a fortress. From Source 1, Noel infers that Singapore was a 
fortress as it had “a lot of big guns” and “concrete 
beach defences”, which meant “the defence was 
quite good”. From Source 2, Noel infers that Singapore was not a 
fortress, because it was not “‘fortified’ in any way”, and 
the guns it had were “useless” against most attacks.Sources 1 and 2 both talk about whether Singapore 
was a fortress. Since that is also the question Noel 
wants to answer, the criterion for comparing the 
sources is their views on whether Singapore was  
a fortress. Sources 1 and 2 disagree in what they say about 
whether Singapore was a fortress. Source 1 says 
Singapore was a fortress, but Source 2 says it was 
not. Hence, Noel concludes that Sources 1 and 2 
have different views on whether Singapore was  
a fortress.Understand the question

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 166) ---
An example has been done for you. By definition, a fortress is a place that can be defended against attack from any direction. However, even if a place is too strong to attack directly, an enemy who is prepared to 
wait or negotiate can still in the end capture it through starvation or betrayal. Anyway, 
the classic fortress had been invented before there were aircraft capable of dropping 
bombs over fixed defences. We have seen that attacking Singapore from the land side was regarded as impossible 
and that no steps were taken to build defences there. – Adapted from a book on the fall of Singapore by historians

British Forces
Although the British made plans to defend Singapore and Malaya, they 
did not have enough resources available to carry them out. Apart from 
resisting German invasion in Europe, the British were also fighting in North 
Africa and supporting the Soviet Union in its struggle against Germany. Compared to these demands, defending its colonies in the Far East was of 
low priority. As a result, whatever military forces the British could spare for Malaya 
and Singapore were insufficient in both number and quality. For example, 
the British air force in Malaya and Singapore comprised mostly ageing and 
outdated Buffalo fighters, nicknamed “flying coffins” due to the short 
life expectancy of their pilots in battle. They were also outnumbered 
by Japan’s modern Zero fighters. Thus, during the fighting, most of the 
British fighters were destroyed and the remainder evacuated to the  
Dutch East Indies or Australia. There were also not enough troops to 
protect the numerous military airfields all over Malaya. In the end, the 
Japanese were able to capture many of these airfields and use them to 
attack other parts of Malaya and Singapore. Furthermore, the forces defending Malaya and Singapore came from many 
different parts of the British Empire, including Scotland, India and Australia 
(see Figure 5.2). This made it difficult for the military commanders to 
understand and work with one another. While some units fought bravely 
during the Japanese invasion, many of the soldiers did not feel it was their 
duty to fight hard and sacrifice themselves in the defence of the colonies. The British were also reluctant to call on the locals to contribute to the 
defence.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 168) ---
Only a small number of local forces were raised and they often 
received minimal training and equipment. The outdated Buffalo fighters (above) used 
by the British in Malaya were no match for 
the Japanese Zero fighters (top). Scottish soldiers training in Singapore (left) and Gurkha soldiers from India training in Malaya (right) just before the war. These troops helped defend Malaya

Most of the troops sent to Malaya and Singapore were poorly trained 
and ill-equipped. There were no tanks and very few anti-tank weapons, 
because the British thought tanks were unsuitable for the jungle.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 172) ---
The 
soldiers received little or no training in fighting in the tropical climate. To 
make matters worse, there were not enough officers to lead the men. The 
British forces were led by General Arthur Percival. Though an experienced 
and capable officer, he had not led such a large and diverse military force 
before in actual combat. As mentioned earlier, Singapore’s defences were designed to prevent  
an attack from the sea. The big guns put in place were to be used for firing 
at big ships. While these guns could be turned landwards to fire at enemies 
on land, they were not equipped with the right ammunition to shoot at 
such enemies. Due to the war in Europe, the 
British could only afford to send 
a very small fleet of warships to 
Singapore. The fleet comprised two 
battleships, HMS Prince of Wales  
and HMS Repulse, and a small 
number of escorting warships. This 
naval force was called Force Z. HMS Prince of WalesWho was  
GENERAL  
ARTHUR PERCIVAL? ? Arthur Percival (1887–1966) did 
not set out to be a soldier. He was 
originally a clerk at an iron trading 
company after leaving school.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 173) ---
When World War I broke out, he 
enlisted in the army. He was rapidly 
promoted and earned several honours,  
ending the war as a respected Major. Thereafter, Percival remained in the 
army, serving in places such as Russia 
and Ireland. In 1936, Percival was posted to Malaya 
to take charge of defence planning. It was during this time that he became 
aware of the Japanese threat to 
Singapore’s security. He thought  
about how the Japanese might attack, 
which turned out to be very similar  
to the actual invasion during  
World War II. A plan was drawn up to 
occupy southern Thailand to prevent 
Japanese troops from landing there, 
but it was not carried out as the  
British feared it would offend the  
Thai government. In 1941, Percival was appointed as 
the General Officer Commanding 
(Malaya), with the temporary rank of 
Lieutenant-General. Thus, he became 
the overall commander of the forces 
defending Malaya and Singapore 
against the Japanese invasion. One of Singapore’s 15-inch coastal defence guns

Japanese soldiers would be landing. On 10 December, the fleet was spotted 
by Japanese planes, which bombed and sank both battleships. Several 
hundred men, including the Admiral commanding Force Z, went down with 
the ships. This was a serious blow to British naval power in the region. Read Source 4 to find out what people in Singapore thought about the 
loss of Force Z at the time. With the destruction of Force Z and the air force, the British had lost their 
naval and air superiority in the region. The Japanese could make use of 
their mastery of the air and the seas to reinforce their attacks. Only the 
British army was left to repel the Japanese attacks. We had been informed that HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse had been sunk by the Japanese. Radio broadcasts 
and newspapers in Singapore tried to reduce the importance of the naval disaster. They also urged the people to remain 
strong, loyal and confident and informed them that better days were ahead. Large military reinforcements were coming 
to Singapore, so we were told. Singapore as the Gibraltar of the East could be held by the British indefinitely. We were 
thus comforted and reassured.

Japanese Plans and Strategies
Japanese Preparations for Invasion
Even before the outbreak of World War II, Japan had made preparations 
for a potential invasion of Malaya and Singapore. Japanese spies disguised 
as tourists or barbers helped to gather information for the military. The 
Japanese army also set up a special research unit to look into techniques 
for jungle fighting and the training of soldiers for the invasion of Malaya. A 
pamphlet on useful tips was written for these soldiers to read before the 
invasion (see Source 5).

The head of the special research unit was Colonel Masanobu Tsuji. He was 
also the mastermind behind the attack on Malaya and Singapore. When 
the Japanese learnt from their spies about Singapore’s defences, Tsuji 
decided not to attack it from the sea. Instead, he planned for the Japanese 
invasion force to land on the beaches of southern Thailand and advance 
down Malaya to attack Singapore from the north. His plan was adopted 
and carried out during the actual invasion. Colonel Masanobu Tsuji Japanese soldiers in heavy camouflage advancing

Japanese Forces
While the British forces defending Malaya and Singapore were mostly 
inexperienced, poorly trained and ill-equipped, many troops among the 
Japanese forces tasked with the invasion were experienced, battle-hardened 
and well-supported with weapons, aircraft, warships and tanks. They were 
led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita, a highly regarded commander. He was 
supported by young, capable and highly motivated officers. The preparations made by the Japanese before the invasion proved to 
be valuable. Using their knowledge of the Malayan jungle, the Japanese 
brought light tanks and bicycles to move their soldiers around quickly. The soldiers were lightly equipped so that they could move fast and catch 
the enemy by surprise (read Source 6 on the next page to find out more 
about the differences between the Japanese and British forces). Japanese tanks in the Malayan jungle, 1942. The original photograph was in black and white.

GENERAL  
TOMOYUKI YAMASHITA?

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 185) ---
? Tomoyuki Y amashita (1885–1946),  
the son of a village doctor, had  
a distinguished military career even 
before the invasion of Malaya and 
Singapore. He graduated from the 
Imperial Japanese Army Academy  
in 1905, ranked 16th out of 920 officer 
cadets. Thereafter, Y amashita went 
through several postings and attained 
the rank of Major-General in 1934. In 1936, Y amashita got involved in a 
failed attempt by some military officers 
to take over the government in Tokyo. He was banished to Korea as a result. He also spent time commanding 
troops in northern China and 
Manchuria. After World War II broke out, 
Y amashita was sent to Italy and 
Germany, where he met Adolf Hitler. Upon returning, he was posted to 
Manchuria as commander of an army 
there. In November 1941, he was 
appointed as commander of the newly 
formed 25th Army, tasked with the 
invasion of Malaya and Singapore. After the successful invasion of Malaya 
and Singapore in 
1942, Y amashita 
became known 
as the “Tiger of 
M a l a y a”. During the invasion, Japanese control of the air and the sea gave them 
an advantage. Japanese fighters could support their troops on the ground 
and drop bombs on the defending forces. Japanese control of Indochina 
(present-day Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) and the South China Sea also 
allowed them to launch more attacks and supply their troops without 
interference from the British. 195

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)However, the Japanese forces were severely outnumbered by the defending 
British forces. For that reason, Yamashita decided to depend on speed 
and surprise to overcome the British. During the battles for Malaya and 
Singapore, the British were repeatedly caught off guard by surprise attacks, 
retreating in haste to avoid being cut off from behind. As a result, they 
left behind large quantities of supplies, equipment and weapons that the 
Japanese took for their own use. The majority [of the Japanese] were on bicycles, talking and laughing just as if they were going to a football match. They seemed to have no standard uniform or equipment and were travelling as light as they possibly could. The general 
impression was one of extraordinary determination. They had been ordered to go, and in their thousands they were going, 
though their equipment was second-rate and much of it had obviously been acquired in Malaya. [In comparison, the British soldiers were] equipped like Christmas trees so that they could hardly walk, much less fight. – Adapted from an account by Freddie Spencer Chapman, 
a British soldier in Malaya during the invasion, published in 1963

The Destruction  
of the Naval Base
The British decided to destroy 
the naval base to prevent  
the enemy from making use 
of its facilities. The loss of the 
famous naval base was one of 
the greatest military setbacks 
ever suffered by the British.1
1 February 1942
The Japanese Headquarters
General Yamashita set up his headquarters 
at the palace of the Sultan of Johor. This 
clever choice gave him a clear view of 
northern Singapore from the palace’s 
five-storey tower. Although it was an easy 
target, Yamashita was confident that the 
British would not fire at the home of their 
old friend, the Sultan. He was right.2
8–9 February 1942
Landings in the Northwest
Japanese forces crossed the Straits of 
Johor in the northwest, where it was 
narrowest. Unsure of where the Japanese 
would attack, General Percival had spread 
his troops all along Singapore’s northern 
coast. With too large an area to defend, the 
British forces could not stop the Japanese 
from securing a foothold on the island.4

7 February 1942
The Fake Attack
To trick the British, the 
Japanese bombarded the 
northeast of Singapore heavily 
and attacked Pulau Ubin. In 
response, the British moved 
troops and precious supplies 
such as petrol and explosives 
from the northwest to the 
northeast, just as the  
Japanese wanted.3

The British Blunder
The Japanese made quick repairs 
to the Causeway, which had been 
blown up by the British during 
their retreat. This allowed the 
Japanese to move more troops 
and equipment into Singapore. Meanwhile, Percival made plans 
to withdraw from the Kranji-
Jurong line to the city centre if 
necessary. Unfortunately, the 
orders were misunderstood and 
some defending forces withdrew 
immediately, leaving the 
northwestern part of Singapore 
undefended. When the mistake 
was discovered, the British 
counter-attacked, but it was too 
late. By then, the Japanese had 
reached Bukit Timah.5
10–11 February 1942
The Battle of Bukit Timah
Bukit Timah was important as it held 
British supplies of food, ammunition and 
spare parts. It also faced a reservoir, which 
was a vital source of water supply.

Fierce 
fighting took place here. Armed only with 
swords, grenades and small rifles, Chinese 
volunteers fought bravely alongside the 
defending forces. The Japanese later took 
revenge by killing all the Chinese men, 
women and children in the nearby village.6

The Battle for
Singapore
15 February 1942
The Bluff That Worked
Later that day, Percival met Yamashita  
at the Ford Motor Factory in Bukit Timah. Yamashita demanded immediate 
surrender by the British. Under pressure, 
Percival agreed. Unknown to him, the 
Japanese were also desperately short 
of ammunition and men, and might not 
have been able to carry on fighting much 
longer. Yamashita’s bluff had worked. The battle for Singapore was over.9
13–14 February 1942
The Battle of Pasir Panjang
The Japanese reached Pasir Panjang 
Ridge (present-day Kent Ridge Park), close 
to the Alexandra area where the main 
British ammunition stores and military 
hospital were located. It was defended by 
the Malay Regiment, including Lieutenant 
Adnan bin Saidi. The Japanese attacked 
and surrounded the hill. Fierce fighting 
took place, with many killed on both sides. However, the Malay Regiment was heavily 
outnumbered and was eventually defeated. 7

SINGAPORE’S DEVELOPMENT AS A PORT CITY UNDER THE BRITISH (1819–1942)Earlier in the chapter (see page 174), you learnt that historians 
sometimes look at the causes of a historical event in different ways. In doing so, they may ask whether the event would necessarily have 
happened given the particular set of factors at that time, or whether 
things could have turned out differently if the initial conditions or 
factors had been different. In the case of the fall of Singapore, one way is to look at whether 
the defeat could have been prevented or avoided by examining the 
causes in terms of:
• the international context (e.g., the war in Europe);
• the circumstances in which the battles for Malaya and Singapore 
were fought (e.g., the readiness and preparations of the British 
and Japanese forces); and
• the choices and decisions of the military and political leaders 
(e.g., Churchill, Percival and Yamashita).Conclusion
The fall of Singapore has been 
described as the worst military 
disaster ever suffered by the British. Numerous books have examined the 
reasons for the defeat and whether 
it could have been avoided. Having 
studied this chapter, would you agree 
that Singapore was doomed to fall? In the international context, the 
British were fighting a major war, 
not just in Asia, but also in Europe 
and North Africa.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 196) ---
With their limited 
resources, the British simply could 
not defend every place with all their 
might. On the other hand, with the 
United States rebuilding its forces 
after the attack on Pearl Harbor, 
the Japanese were able to focus on 
attacking Southeast Asia. Given this, 
it is clear that the Japanese held 
the advantage over the British in 
Southeast Asia. Surrender negotiations at the Ford Motor Factory, 15 February 1942BE A YOUNG HISTORIAN: CAUSATION

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 197) ---
For British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the defence of Britain itself 
was more important than the defence of its colonies in Asia, including 
Singapore. This meant that fewer resources were made available for the 
defence of Singapore. Thus, British commanders in Malaya and Singapore 
had to make do with what they had, which was mostly inferior to what the 
Japanese forces had. To make matters worse, the defenders were under-
prepared to resist the Japanese invasion, due to poor planning and training. On the other side, the Japanese forces were well-prepared and equipped. These circumstances, combined with the international context of the war 
mentioned earlier, made the defence of Singapore a very difficult, if not 
impossible, task. Finally, what about the roles of key individuals? Could Singapore have  
been saved if Churchill had sent more troops and weapons? What if  
General Percival had been a better commander, or General Yamashita  
a worse one? As Prime Minister, Churchill had to prioritise the defence of 
Britain over that of its colonies. It might be unreasonable to expect him 
to allocate more resources to Singapore when Britain was fighting for 
its own survival. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether more resources or  
a better commander of the British forces could have made a significant 
difference, given the odds stacked against them. On the Japanese side, a less  
competent commander than Yamashita might have taken longer to 
conquer Singapore or at a higher cost, but he most probably would still have  
managed it in the end. The fall of Singapore marked a new chapter in the island’s history: 123 years 
of continuous British rule had been disrupted. The people in Singapore 
looked to the dawn of Japanese rule with uncertainty, anxiety and fear.Who was  
WINSTON CHURCHILL? ?

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 198) ---
Winston Churchill (1874–1965), the 
descendant of a famous 18th-century 
English general, had a brief military 
career before becoming a Member 
of Parliament in 1900. He then held 
many important posts in the British 
government up to 1929. Churchill was one of the few British 
politicians to recognise the dangers 
Hitler posed to Europe and the British 
Empire. He became Prime Minister 
of Britain in May 1940 and refused to 
surrender to Germany. His brilliant 
speeches, strong determination and 
tireless efforts inspired and sustained 
the British people towards eventual 
victory in the war. Churchill later wrote an 
acclaimed history of the 
war and was awarded 
the Nobel Prize for 
Literature in 1953 in 
recognition of his 
achievements. Japanese troops celebrating the capture of Singapore, February 1942.

As the overall commander of the British forces defending Singapore, General Percival received much 
criticism for his role in the military disaster. After surrendering Singapore to the Japanese, Percival joined 
many of his troops as a prisoner of war. At the end of the war, he was released and attended the ceremony 
marking the formal surrender of the Japanese. Thereafter, he retired from military service and returned to 
Britain, where he wrote an account of the Malayan campaign. Unlike other British military officers who 
retired with the rank of Lieutenant-General, Percival was not awarded a knighthood (an honour usually 
awarded to people who have provided exceptional service to the country). There are many differing views about Percival.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 203) ---
Some feel he was a poor commander who made too many 
crucial mistakes. Others argue that he was simply a convenient scapegoat (person to blame) for the military 
disaster. How far was Percival to blame for the fall of Singapore? Read the sources that follow and carry out 
the investigation to decide for yourself. A courageous, compassionate and intelligent soldier of great integrity, Percival was not a born leader and field commander, 
and he was slow to adapt to changed circumstances. While he impressed many people who knew him well, Percival lacked 
the ability to command people’s attention. Slight in build, he appeared shy and oversensitive, while his calm manner could 
easily be mistaken for disinterest and weakness. – A description of General Percival, adapted from a book by British historian Constance Mary Turnbull, published in 2009SOURCE A

Many of the causes which contributed to our defeat in Malaya and Singapore had a common origin, namely the  
British Empire’s lack of readiness for war. Our shortage in ships, aircraft and tanks, the inexperience of our leaders, and 
the lack of training of our troops, can all be attributed to a failure to prepare for war. In 1941, when the crisis came, it was 
too late to put things right. By that time, we were engaged in a life and death struggle in the West, and war material which 
might have saved Singapore was sent elsewhere. The choice was made and Singapore had to suffer.

--- Semantic Chunk from Sec2 (Page 205) ---
In my opinion this 
decision, however painful and regrettable, was unavoidable and right. – An extract adapted from General Percival’s memoirs, published in 1949SOURCE C
Percival was certainly treated unfairly by those who came after him. His personal bravery, ability as a staff officer and 
genuine concern for the welfare of his troops are all beyond dispute. Percival was given an impossible plan. By making 
whatever changes he could, he might have delayed, but not prevented, the fall of Singapore. He certainly lacked charisma, 
and the gift of inspiring men to the highest pitch of heroism and determination. Percival was unfortunate that he was 
given responsibilities far beyond his capabilities, and he lacked the ability to inspire and lead. – An evaluation of Percival, adapted from a book by military historians Richard Holmes and Anthony Kemp, published in 1982SOURCE B
