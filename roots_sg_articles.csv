The National Day Parade (NDP) is an annual celebration of Singapore's independence. It is also a platform for Singaporeans from all walks of life to come together to celebrate the nation's milestones and achievements while rallying ourselves in preparation for the future. This article traces the many first and highlights of NDPs over the 50 years to 2016.
Singapore's first NDP was held in 1966, a year after being separated from Malaysia.

In the 1960s, all the parades were held at the Padang, which is one of the reasons that the Padang is still an iconic historical landmark in Singapore. The military displays and marching parades drew spectators young and old, regardless of the weather. This speaks of the nation's strength, progress and unity.

The 1970s was a decade that saw a surge in industrial development and technological advancement. This was evident in the NDP celebrations as Singapore had her first state flag flypast in 1970.

In 1974, the parade was broadcast in colour for the first time. In 1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1983, NDP celebrations were decentralized and were more informal and casual. This allowed more people to catch the performances and parades on-site. In the 1980s, National Day songs made their debut with songs such as Stand up for Singapore (1984). Separately, Singapore's impressive military displays grew continually and advanced technologically. Since 1986, parade spectators have enjoyed atmospheric effects created through laser beams, lights and projections.

As Singaporeans came together in 1990 to sing One People, One Nation, One Singapore in celebration of Singapore's 25th birthday at The Padang, they also saw, for the first time, a sea review of our defence on water. NDPs in the 1990s were filled with much spectacle. Particularly memorable was the 1994 NDP ""night parade"" that started later than usual at 7.15pm.

NDPs in the 2000s were vastly different from the ones before, reflecting the changes and progress the young nation had made. In NDP 2002, there was a grand toast to Singapore's NEWater. The shift from the National Stadium to the Float@Marina Bay in 2007 was also a key event for Singapore. That year, Singapore saw the first ever NDP on water with Singapore's skyline providing the backdrop.

NDP 2015, however, was the grandest NDP to date, with the nation celebrating its 50th birthday. Year-long celebrations marked the golden jubilee, which was termed SG50.

The 50 years leading up to 2016 for Singapore have been a swift march of growth and confidence, with these changes reflected in the choreography of our parades. National Day is not just a day for Singaporeans to celebrate their nation's birthday, it is also a day when Singaporeans set aside everything to celebrate their achievements, and look back with pride at the nation's growth from year to year, recalling key national moments that will stay in their hearts and minds.

Few today would associate the tranquil getaway of Sentosa with death but that was the case for centuries when it was known as Pulau Blakang Mati or “the island behind which lies death”. A competition in 1969 to rename the 500ha island was part of a grand plan to transform it into a tourist destination as well as an enclave for the super rich. Here’s how it happened.

Pirates, villages and forts
Located off the southern coast of Singapore, the 500-hectare island we know as Sentosa today, used to be called Pulau Blakang Mati from as far back as the 1600s.1 Its name translates to “the island behind which lies death”, possibly a result of brutal pirate battles of yesteryear.2

During the colonial era, a mysterious epidemic wiped out staff working at a British signal station.3 British doctor Robert Little who attended to the ill on the island in 1848, documented the existence of three villages inhabited by Malays, Bugis and Chinese.4They were: Kampong Ayer Bandera, Kampong Serapong and Kampong Blakan Mati. The doctor added that the island was home to various plantations among which pineapple was the most prevalent. Blakang Mati, he added, was ""one vast pinery, supplying the island of Singapore with this delightful and refreshing fruit"".
The island by and large served as a military base during the colonial era. To guard the eastern and western entrances of the harbour, Forts Serapong, Connaught and Siloso, as well as the Mount Imbiah Battery were installed in the 1870s and 1880s. In the 1930s, the British added guns with the ability to pierce through armoured ships. Royal Artillery units also moved in.

British personnel on Blakang Mati were served by dhobis (Indian laundry workers) and Chinese cooks. For leisure, they boarded sampans for the mainland where they could pay for a dance with a cabaret hostess at one of Singapore's three amusement parks, or enjoy a steak at one of the cafes around Victoria Street.7

A dark episode
Contrary to popular belief, the military installations on Blakang Mati were not completely useless in the Battle of Singapore for they were used to fire on targets in the centre, west and north of Singapore. In fact, the Japanese perceived the fortifications as a threat which explains the air raid of 18 January 1942 when 100 bombs were dropped on Blakang Mati.8
Shortly after the invasion, the Japanese rounded up Chinese men and had them executed in remote locations around Singapore. In 1957, eight skulls and almost 100 bones were found in one of Blakang Mati’s creeks — likely the remains of Chinese men who had worked at the Singapore Harbour Board.9
During the occupation, Blakang Mati housed a prisoner of war camp for about 1,000 allied troops. One prisoner, Sergeant Thomas A. Dineen, was a radio hobbyist who cobbled together a radio receiving set from odds and ends like silver paper and wire. He discreetly disseminated news of Allied victories elsewhere in the world to keep morale up among fellow prisoners.10

After the war, various British military units, as well as the Gurkhas, reoccupied Blakang Mati.
The civilian population also grew in numbers, as did economic activity on the island in the form of shops and services. Schools and religious institutions sprung up as well.11
Mainland visitors were drawn to Blakang Mati. Some brought with them fishing rods for a day out in the sun, others spent the night there, camping along its coast and making friends with villagers.12
“Battle” for the island
In 1967, Blakang Mati was officially parked under the jurisdiction of the newly independent government of Singapore13 which was understandably excited about its potential. The ministry of defence wanted to place security guns there, while other agencies envisioned a petrochemical complex or oil-related industrial hub. A few suggested it take on new life as a tourist resort.14
The plan to start an oil refinery was given legs when the government reached an agreement with energy corporation Esso. However, Albert Winsemius, an economic advisor to the government, as well as Alan Choe who was at the helm of Singapore’s Urban Renewal Unit (now the Urban Redevelopment Authority), convinced Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew that it was better to turn the island into a resort for recreation and tourism.
The potential air pollution from having an oil refinery so close to the city centre might have pushed the authorities to ultimately choose to retain Blakang Mati as a holiday island cum green lung.15 The deal with Esso was renegotiated and the refinery was eventually built in Jurong, further from the heart of the city.
A suggestion to turn Blakang Mati into an industrial complex with deep water berths was also shelved following a study which found heavy shipping traffic along the island's coasts too challenging to work around.16 Other sites which had been vacated by British forces, were allocated for such purposes instead.17
Building paradise
In January 1969, the chairman of the Tourist Promotion Board of Singapore, P. H. Meadows outlined plans to build a dreamy “south sea island paradise” with chalet-like hotels as well as golf courses and parklands. There too would be the option for scuba-diving and horse-riding. The goal, he shared, was to ""attract millions of sunseeking tourists from all over the world”.18
To this end, the Tourist Promotion Board launched a naming contest to rebrand the site.19 The isle of tranquillity, or Sentosa in Malay, was eventually selected — a stark contrast to the ominous sounding Blakang Mati.
By 1972, $124 million worth of state money and private sector investment had been set aside for the resort’s development. Sentosa Development Corporation was established the same year to oversee the massive undertaking.
To connect visitors from mainland Singapore (via Mount Faber) to Sentosa, a cable car system was rolled out in 1974. It was well-received, with 50,000 passengers taking it monthly for almost a year. To cope with demand, more cars were added.
In its early years, visitors could only access Sentosa by ferry or cable car. This changed when a monorail was completed in 1982. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Soon after, attractions such as the Sentosa Golf Club, Sentosa Coralarium, the Palawan Beach Lagoon, a musical fountain, and Fort Siloso which was repurposed into an educational pitstop, were completed. Later, a butterfly park, and the Surrender Chambers which housed waxwork exhibits detailing Singapore’s WWII story, opened to the public.

Visitorship hit a million during the financial year of 1979/1980.
Not all was smooth sailing. In 1983, a drillship crashed into the Sentosa cableway, knocking off two cars which plunged 55 metres into the sea. Seven passengers died.20
After the incident, the Sentosa Development Corporation put in place measures to better ensure visitor safety.21

Keeping it fresh
Over the years, the Sentosa Development Corporation has had to refresh its offerings to satiate changing appetites and generate ongoing interest.
Infrastructural improvements, facelifts to existing destinations, as well as the addition of new hotels and attractions such as Underwater World Singapore, and an $8 million, 12-storey high sculpture of the Merlion marked the 1990s.
In the 2000s, the island began hosting popular beach dance parties. Sentosa Cove, a residential enclave for the ultra wealthy, was launched in 2003.
In 2010, Resorts World Sentosa comprising the Universal Studios theme park, as well as the Republic’s first casino, opened its doors.
As of 2022 — Sentosa’s 50th anniversary — plans are afoot to update and expand the paradise island yet again.22

Notes"
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/badang-the-magnificent/story,"This story first appeared in National Heritage Board's book, titled, 'Attack Of The Swordfish And Other Singapore Tales' by Charlotte Lim (Text) and Alicia Tan Yen Ping (Illustration). This book consists of six illustrated tales for early Primary school children that are based on Singapore legends or traditions.
There was once a slave named Badang who lived in a place called Saluang. He hated the sweat and toil of working on his master's lands. ""I wish I could be strong! Then the work would not be so hard!"" Badang would moan.
There were days too when the hopeful slave longed to be free from bondage. Free to go out fishing. It was the one thing he looked forward to doing whenever he had the chance to slip out of the farm.
Under night's secret veil, while the frogs croaked and the owls gawked, he would lay traps along the sea bed to catch fish. Whenever he could sneak out again, he would return to claim his catch and cook it over a fire.
However, one day, Badang discovered only fish bones in his net. He looked around but no one or nothing was in sight. Hungry and disappointed, he decided to lay a trap to catch the culprit.
After placing a freshly caught fish in the net, Badang hid behind some tall grass and waited patiently. He was about to doze off when a rustling sound startled him. To his horror, a hideous creature with fiery red eyes trudged out of the cold damp woods. It began foaming at the mouth as it greedily approached the net.
The lumbering monster had horns on its dreadful head and tusks that stuck out from its upper jaw. It was taller than any man Badang had ever seen. Its grimy beard reached its waist and was as tangled as its long, unkempt hair.
Badang was about to take off but when he saw the creature wolfing down the fish he had caught, he got very mad! He pounced on it with his parang.
""How dare you steal my fish?"" shouted Badang, as he grabbed the monster by its beard and held the parang to its throat.
""I'll kill you for this!""
The monster almost choked on the fish. It fell on its knees, begging Badang for mercy. It wailed, ""Please don't kill me, kind sir! I'll repay your kindness by granting you anything you ask for! Please let me go!""
Badang looked the monster in the eye and realised it was telling the truth. Perhaps this was his chance to ask for supernatural strength. Badang said, ""I want to be the strongest man on earth! Do it or you will die this instant!""
The monster nodded. ""I will make you the strongest man alive but first, you have to do something.""
""What do I have to do?"" Badang asked.
""You have to eat my vomit,"" disclosed the monster. ""Only then will you gain great strength!""
The thought of having to swallow vomit made Badang sick in the stomach but he desperately wanted the power.
When he had fulfilled his task, the monster asked earnestly, ""Now will you let me go?""
Badang was a man of honour, so he set the beast free and warned it never to take what did not belong to it.
Back on the farm, Badang eagerly made use of his newfound strength. The other slaves and his master were amazed. Soon, news about his mighty power spread across the kingdom and neighbouring lands.
It was not long before the King of Singapore, Sri Rama Wira Kerma, heard about Badang and summoned him to his court.
""I hear that you have great strength,"" said the King when Badang was brought before him.
""Yes, Your Majesty,"" said Badang, bowing respectfully.
""I have a 45-foot boat which has just been completed. It would take at least one thousand men to push it into the sea. Can you do it on your own?"" asked the King.
""I will try, Your Majesty,"" said Badang. With just one amazing touch of his hand, he pushed the boat into the water as if it were a toy.
The King was delighted. ""From this day forth, you shall no longer be a slave,"" he said, ""and you shall be the new commander of my army.""
When the ruler of Kalinga in India heard about Badang, he wanted to test his strength.
""I will reward you with seven ships of goods if you can beat my strong man in a series of contests, Badang,” the Ruler said. The strong man from Kalinga, not wanting to admit defeat, challenged Badang to a final duel.
""Let's see who can throw that stone the furthest,"" he said, pointing to the large smooth rock on the top of a hill.
Badang agreed. The Kalinga strong man huffed and puffed. He could only lift the stone up to his knees. Badang, however, picked it up like it was a rubber seed and flung it so far away that it landed at the mouth of the Singapore River.
Soon, stories of Badang's courage and victories were told in every corner of the land. He became the champion of the people. Everywhere he went, he was greeted by cheers and tributes, especially among slaves.
Legend has it that Badang served the King well until his last day and Singapore enjoyed many years of peace and security.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Geylang-Serai-Ku/story,"Located at junction of Onan Road and Geylang Road, Garrick Cinema was once a popular cinema   that served the residents of Joo Chiat.
Former Joo Chiat Road resident Mr Chan Thai Ho spent his entire childhood in Joo Chiat Road, during which he would watch films at Garrick Cinema.
Today, the former Garrick cinema houses the Muslim Converts' Association of Singapore. Photo courtesy of MCAS.
“I remember watching the film Pontianak with all the other kampong boys,” said Mr Chan.
“Back in those days, tickets cost less than a bowl of mee. So you either get some form of entertainment or you go about satisfying your belly,” he continued.
Mr Chan also commented that ticket prices would increase as you go further up the rows – the back rows offer a better view. 
For instance, the middle wing and the back row would be priced at 50 cents and a dollar a seat respectively, as opposed to paying just 30 cents for the front few seats.
The area around the cinema became a playground for Mr Chan and his friends, before he pursued his cadetship with the Singapore Fire Brigade.
Mr Chan’s cousin Mrs Wee Gek Suan was also a former Joo Chiat Road resident.
For Mrs Wee, talking about the Garrick Cinema brings back fond memories of her childhood playing on the grounds of what was once a Dutch Camp that housed a Dutch community following the Japanese surrender in 1945.
The camp stretched from Geylang Serai all the way to Crane Road.
“I would spend my afternoons helping my mom and my aunt sell gado-gado beneath a shady tree in the Dutch Camp,” she began.
“The Dutch troops were very friendly towards us and I remember receiving sweets from them,” she continued.
According to Mrs Wee, the Dutch loved gado-gado so much so that every bowl would be sold before the end of the day.
“It was a very pleasant community surrounded by a beautiful setting of luscious greenery and little semi-detached houses.”
Garrick Cinema was renamed Galaxy Theatre in 1965, and is still known as ‘The Galaxy’ to the elder folk. Today, The Galaxy houses Muslim Converts’ Association of Singapore (MCAS), or Darul Arqam – as commonly referred to by the younger generation.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 3 - Jan 2017
One gets a sense of both the local and the colonial when exploring Bukit Timah. From road names such as Princess of Wales Road and Jalan Haji Alias, to buildings like St Joseph’s Church, the former Ford Motor Factory and The Chinese High School, centuries of history can be found in Bukit Timah, each telling a part of Singapore’s past.
Remnants of Singapore’s colonial era can be found in the very road that traverses Bukit Timah today. In the early years after Sir Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a British trading port in 1819, the country’s interior was still relatively unexplored by the Europeans. Even though there were signs in the 1820s that indicated the presence of local settlers inland, the land beyond the Singapore River, such as Bukit Timah, was still deemed “wild and lawless” and these early inhabitants as “straying from the fold of civilisation”, quoting Sir James Brooke a naval officer stationed in Singapore in 1839.
Brooke’s evident bias reflected the colonial thinking of the time. Without access into the interior, it was impossible for the British to establish control over the land. As such, a long road weaving into Bukit Timah was constructed from the 1830s to 1840s, an attempt by the British authorities to impose some degree of colonial regulation over the unsurveyed interior. Part of this road is known contemporarily as Bukit Timah Road and Upper Bukit Timah Road. Completed in 1845, the road connected the northern tip of Singapore from Kranji to the heart of the city in the south, serving also as the main artery leading to neighbouring Johor.
The road’s establishment precipitated a greater flow of people and commodities into the interior of Singapore. About half a century later in 1900, a railway line was being built to facilitate this movement. This railway line was later known as the Singapore-Johor Railway, and has become a shared memory among the subsequent generations of Singaporeans who remembered travelling to Malaysia via this railway.

As the interior opened, missionaries also ventured inwards to evangelise. French Missionary Fr Anatole Mauduit MEP purchased a parcel of land from the British East India Company to set up St Joseph’s Church between 1852 and 1853 at the 9 1⁄2 milestone along Upper Bukit Timah Road. Like many of the early Christian churches that owned tracts of land, the church parcelled out its land to parishioners to live and work. Over time, a network of institutions were built around St Joseph’s Church, including a trade school that would become Boys’ Town Singapore, serving the local community at Bukit Timah.
Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is arguably the most prominent landmark in the area. Standing at 163 metres high, the reserve is a sanctuary for many who seek reprieve from the hustle of the urban city today. The establishment of the reserve began in the 1840s, when the colonial authorities first made the hill a reserve. The area was recognised for its thriving ecology, with naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace extolling about the rich biodiversity found there after visiting Singapore in the 1850s. Wallace described the reserve in his book, The Malay Archipelago, saying, “[in] all my subsequent travels in the East I rarely if ever met with so productive a spot.” His observations in Bukit Timah also contributed to his eventual thesis on natural selection, conceived independently from Charles Darwin who also arrived at the same theory.

However, despite initial colonial efforts to prevent illegal timber harvesting and preserve the rainforest, poor management over the years depleted the hill’s primary forests. The granite quarries of the 1900s that are today incorporated into the reserve’s trails had further threatened the hill’s fragile ecology. Portions of the primary rainforest remaining today were saved in the 1930s by the efforts of Richard Eric Holttum, the director of the Botanic Gardens and his staff, including assistant director E. J. H. Corner and his assistant Mohammad Noor, who tried to lure away illegal woodcutters and throw their logging equipment away when they were distracted.

The serenity of the reserve today betrays the darker side of its history during the Second World War. The hill’s elevation made Bukit Timah an important target for the Japanese during the Second World War, providing a tactical vantage point that the invading troops wanted. Moreover, vital British supply dumps were stored in the area. At midnight of 10 February 1942, Japanese troops marched into Bukit Timah Village and by the following day, Bukit Timah hill fell into Japanese hands.

Another prominent site in Bukit Timah also featured significantly during the war. The former Ford Motor Factory along Upper Bukit Timah Road was converted into Lieutenant General Yamashita’s forward headquarters. It was at the factory where the terms of British surrender were discussed on February 15, 1942, a date that is still sombrely commemorated annually.

As the 1950s arrived, stirrings of early nationalism began to take hold in Singapore. Bukit Timah bore witness to this period of political awakening during the tumultuous decades of the 1950s and 1960s. Students from The Chinese High School were at the frontlines of several anti-colonial disputes, including the May 13, 1954 student protest over national conscription, which then saw about 2,000 Chinese High and Chung Cheng High School students staging a 22-day hunger strike against police violence in the following days. Students from the nearby University of Malaya (today’s National University of Singapore Bukit Timah Campus) also formed societies such as the University Socialist Club and Democratic Club to agitate for social and political causes during this period.
While these heritage sites reflect the more eventful moments in Singapore history, other places in Bukit Timah are remembered for being well-loved community spaces. Unsurprisingly, several of these spaces revolve around food, which is an unspoken shared pastime for Singaporeans. Some of these places draw Singaporeans from other parts of the island to Bukit Timah. The Adam Food Centre, for example, is one such popular food haunt. It started as a group of open-air stalls before moving to its current location opposite Serene Centre in 1974. Some of the stalls today, such as Bahrakath Mutton Soup King (stall No. 10) and Sathiyame Jeyam (stall No. 13), have been around since the early 1970s.

The rows of shophouses at Cheong Chin Nam Road and Chun Tin Road also offer a plethora of food choices. The latter street was named after Cheong Chun Tin, the first qualified dentist of Chinese descent in Singapore, whose son Chin Nam owned a rubber estate in the area. These roads grew popular from the 1990s, becoming well-known for restaurants that served halal Malay, Indian and Chinese dishes. Today, Korean and Chinese eateries can also be found there, offering even greater variety to the bustling lunch and dinner crowd.
Especially for the older generation, it is also not possible to speak of Bukit Timah without referring to the once-famous Beauty World, which started out as an amusement park during the Japanese Occupation and later converted into a marketplace in 1947. Unfortunately, Beauty World was destroyed by two large fires in 1975 and 1977, and subsequently redeveloped. Today, the Beauty World name is carried on by the shopping malls Beauty World Centre and Beauty World Plaza, both built in the 1980s and located across the road of the original market.
It is hard not to notice the number of schools that line the stretch of Bukit Timah Road. Bukit Timah is home to The Chinese High School, Nanyang Girls’ High School, Methodist Girls’ School, National Junior College and Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary, to name a few. Pei Hwa Presbyterian is one of the oldest schools in Bukit Timah, founded by the Chinese Christian Church (now Glory Presbyterian Church) in 1889.

For many of these students who went to school in the area in the 1990s, the former McDonald’s Place at King Albert Park would have been one of the choice places in Bukit Timah to hang out after class. The spacious two-storey branch opened in 1991 as the biggest McDonald’s outlet in Singapore, and also housed the restaurant’s corporate headquarters and a staff training centre. Students and residents alike have incorporated their visits to the restaurant as part of their daily routine. “We would have lunch, read books, study and enjoy the air-con,” David Lim, a former Nan Hua Secondary alumnus remembers. Some students would park themselves on one of the 433 seats daily to study during the examination period. It is also very common for residents to visit the outlet for breakfast on Saturday mornings. Although the outlet closed in 2014, these memories live on among the generations of students who studied in Bukit Timah.

Bukit Timah is one of the areas that witnessed the Japanese invasion during World War II, and was also where the British surrendered on 15 February 1942, marking the start of the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. These sites of World War II are featured in the Bukit Timah Heritage Trail, one of the 17 trails offered by the National Heritage Board as of 2016. The trails can be downloaded at the NHB portal here.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/East-Coast-Lagoon-Food-Village,"The East Coast Lagoon Food Village was built over land which was reclaimed from the sea. The reclamation that created the East Coast Lagoon was started in the 1960s. It was not until 1971 that the construction of the first housing blocks in the area began, and with this, the development of the beach front also commenced. The laying out of the lagoon (1972-76) also included provision for hawker stalls. It was in 1977, after the completion of the lagoon, that the concept of the hawker centre and its site was finally confirmed.
The construction of the new hawker centre started in April 1977. This single-level timbered structured eatery was designed in such a way that it blended in with the environment of the seaside and swimming lagoon. The cooking area was composed of 10 structures which had butterfly-shaped roofs while the eating areas had 40 pyramid-shaped top shelters.  It was completed in late 1978 at a cost of $685,000. The eating areas were “arranged in a series of courtyards to create interesting spaces and to act as covered links from one stall to another”. To give customers a better view of the lagoon, “the floor of the entire centre is raised”.
Most of the initial cooked food hawkers in this newly built hawker centre were relocated from Alkaff Lane, near the junction of McPherson Road and Serangoon Road.
However, the new food centre encountered challenging times soon after it opened for business. Despite having been Singapore’s only seaside hawker centre, it experienced relatively poor sales in the 1980s. It was towards the end of 1990s that the stalls in the food centre became “well-known among foodies island-wide”.  By this time, it also became a popular and choice weekend destination for those in search of their favourite food.
In 1981, following the norms of the day, the hawker centre was refashioned as the East Coast Lagoon Food Centre. Following this, it underwent several major upgrading exercises in 1988, 1992 and 2002. It was after the 1992 renovation that the food centre was renamed East Coast Lagoon Food Rendezvous.
During the 2002-2004 revamp, which cost $4.5 million, the structure of the new food centre was transformed to reflected Balinese-style architecture to look resort-like. This round of renovation was had been part the Government's Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme. It seems that all 61 hawkers had opted to return when the works was completed, although they were given the option of accepting $23,000 for leaving. It was Mr Daniel Wang, Commissioner of Public Health (1981-2003), Director General of Public Health (2004), who told the architect to make full use of its unique location next to the beach, so that even people in swimming costumes could walk into the hawker centre to eat. When it officially reopened after the renovation in January 2004 it was renamed as the East Coast Lagoon Food Village.
In June 2013, four food stalls caught fire. Although only certain stalls had been damaged, the NEA, which had already planned for the centre to undergo an upgrading, took the opportunity the fire presented to close the hawker centre for 3 months for its upgrading programme that cost $1.5 million. It was during this upgrade that new roofing and timber flooring on walkways were also installed.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Adam-Road-Food-Centre,"The Adam Road Hawker Centre, opened in 1974, was one of the series of dedicated food centres created in the 1970s. As part of the government’s wider effort to remove hawkers from the streets, it was built independent of a wet market. The hawker centre had its roots in an earlier market started in 1971 when the Public Works Department laid the ground for temporary food stalls next to Bukit Timah Canal. This was opposite the present food centre. This first establishment was actually a series of temporary sheds that housed 32 stalls.

In 1973, when the government announced plans to build a highway across Bukit Timah Road to link Adam Road to Farrer Road, which affected the centre, plans were then made to shift it across the road to its present site. The new hawker centre was officially opened by the then Minister for Law and National Development, E W Barker on 28 September 1974. It had 32 cooked food stalls, as it had in the old centre. Most of the hawkers who started at this new centre were from the first batch of vendors who were “originally stationed at the junction of Farrer Road and Adam Road where conditions were not healthy”, having been next to a canal.
The design of the first centre was a basic U-shaped layout that was linked at the front by a covered walkway. The middle of the centre was an open space with the round tables with four round seats were permanently mounted on tile floors. The stalls were overlaid by mosaic tiles and had steel frames and bars that held up a zinc corrugated roof over the stalls.
Soon after opening, the Adam Road Hawker Centre had already been famed as a place for great Malay food. It was known to provide cheap and “very tasty” food. It is still particularly famed for its nasi lemak and mutton soup. In 2016, Adam Road Food Centre stall serves 1,000 plates of nasi lemak daily.
Besides good eats, Adam Road Food Centre has also been a favourite visit by many across the years. In the 1980s, Adam Road Food Centre was the designated hawker centre for police personnel lunch breaks. They would take lunch there after their tour of duty before returning to the station. It was also frequently patronised by students studying nearby (University), chauffeurs and the residents nearby.
However, having been built so close to the Bukit Timah Canal, the centre was constantly flooded in the 1980s when it rained heavily. Quite often, customers were stranded in the hawker centre during times of serious flooding. Adam Road Food Centre underwent major repairs and redecoration in 1997.
In 2001, the food centre was closed for 5 months for another round of renovation, and reopened in mid-May 2002. The upgrading works cost $1.73 million and was the first Environment Ministry hawker centre to be completed under its upgrading programme. The upgraded centre had a higher roof in the same shape as the old one to improve ventilation, new tiles and the rules floor was raised to prevent flooding and a courtyard with umbrella-covered tables and chairs. All the food stallholders chose to stay after the upgrading ad been completed. The refreshed centre, including the outdoor seats and rectangular tables, could accommodate about 410 persons, up from 345 prior to this exercise. The five old angsana trees located outside the centre were preserved as part of the government special effort retain the uniqueness of the eatery.  These trees give shade, limited shelter from rain and sun, and also serve as a muffler for traffic noises.
Other unique characteristics of the food centre, such as the nine-sided, almost circular, shape of the building and the central outdoor dining courtyard, were retained to maintain the sense of familiarity to the centre.
The sense of belonging of the old stallholders had been so strong that all of them chose to remain in the newly revamped centre although they were all offered alternative sites during the renovation.
Over the years, great effort has been taken to keep the Adam Road Food Centre a clean and conducive place to dine. It underwent further updating and face-lifts in 2008 and 2016.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Geylang-Serai-Market-Food-Centre,"The present Geylang Serai Market & Food Centre espouses the heritage of a number of markets in the Geylang Serai area that goes back to the pre-World War II days. There was a make shift hawker shelter at the entrance of Kampong Geylang Serai, opposite Joo Chiat Road, which the municipality erected some time before 1930. The locals called it Geylang Serai Market. Although it was closed soon after 1930, hawkers continued to ply there and the “market place” continued. When the Japanese Occupation started, the grounds of this market space was turned into an amusement park. After the war, the makeshift street hawker-market area made a comeback. By the early 1950s, the residents of the nearby Kampong Melayu started to visit this “Malay” market frequently for their marketing needs as they had no market of their own at Jalan Eunos.

From 1952, the government turned the area into a “Changi Trade Fair”, which was intended to be Singapore’s largest trade and industrial fairground. Upon completion, it was christened the Great Eastern Trade Fair. However, it started faltering from 1954. The site owners opened the New City Cinema within its grounds in October 1957 in the hope of bring new life to the site. It nevertheless closed a year later. Interestingly, it was not because the area was not well patronised. The fact of the matter was that the Malays of the district preferred to visit market stalls around Great Eastern Park.
The great leap forward came in 1962 when the government announced the start of the Geylang Serai Development Scheme which was the first step in the urban development of the district, and this included the building of a proper market on the site of now defunct Great Eastern Park.
PM Lee Kuan Yew himself laid the foundation stone of the new market in August 1963. When this covered market was completed in 1964, the estate had a simple wet market under a zinc roof. The locals called it Pasar Geylang Serai.
Even before the completion of the market, the Geylang Serai was already a Malay cultural heartland, where the street hawkers had formed a “permanent bazaar” where many Malays would visit every festive occasion. Naturally, the Malay Stallholders Association of Geylang asked the government for a piece of ground next to the market to set up a Malay bazaar.
The opening of the market, unfortunately, coincided with the 1964 racial riots. As a result, many of the street hawkers who were supposed to have moved into the new Geylang Serai Market decided to give it a miss for fear that they may be attacked. So, Geylang Serai Market became a white elephant for some years, while the street hawkers continued to operate all along the streets around.
Over time, most of the market stalls were eventually occupied. In 1975, almost a decade after opening, Geylang Serai Market underwent its first upgrade. At this point, the market had three sections: the Eating House, which was considered the place where Singapore’s largest variety of Muslim food could be found, the Market proper (wet market) and the textile and sundry goods area, where many of the stalls were owned by Malays or Indian Muslims.
In 1978, the stalls in the market doubled when market produce and cooked food stalls from Haig Road Market were shifted there. By this time, the Geylang Serai Market had become the main market in the area as the nearby Changi and Joo Chiat markets had already closed. Its growing popularity had seen it outlive its neighbouring markets. In the early 1980s, the market attracted shoppers during Hari Raya, and not from all parts of Singapore but also from across the Causeway.
The turning point came in 1984 when the government announced plans for the conservation of Geylang Serai’s Malay cultural heritage with the development of a Malay cultural village next to Geylang Serai Market. When the construction of the Village commenced in earnest, the market underwent renovation. When the Village faltered, the market was redeveloped independently. In 2006, the market was torn down and rebuilt. It was completed in 2009 and the old stallholders returned. One of the original intent in rebuilding the whole market was to make it more attractive and accessible to tourists.  This $18.2 million market building is shaped like a Malay Kampong house. The completion of the new market in 2011 coincided with the closure of the Malay Village, and this made the Geylang Serai Market one of the bigger draws of the area. Many still visit the market to get their Malay bajus and batiks which could be gotten on the cheap. This double-storey market and hawker centre is unique for its Malay kampong design that retains and exudes its cultural heritage.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Newton-Circus-Food-Centre,"Newton Food Centre was opened in 1971 as Singapore’s first hawker centre built without a wet market.  It was part of the government’s 1970 initiative to build dedicated food centres along major thoroughfares and traffic intersections.
First christened as the Newton Circus Hawker Centre, it has been erected on a piece of empty ground opposite the traffic circus (Newton Circus) and in proximity of a Malay Girls’ School which had been there since the mid-1950s. Situated opposite the centre was also the Anthony Road Girl’s School (closed in 1983). These schools and the adjoining Government Quarters in the area, had created a sizable community in the district which became a magnet that attracted street hawkers. As early as the 1950s street hawkers had already gathered at this crossroad to ply their trade in a weekly bazaar. By 1960, it had become so popular that the bazaar was held three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Office workers and housewives in search of good deals frequented the bazaar. By 1966, the Newton Circus street hawkers had turned the district into a pasar malam site. The government found it difficult to relocate all of them to other sites.
At the same time, by 1970, the Newton Circles area had proven to have been a significant intersection into town. The government decided to build a hawker centre on site with its own parking facilities. It was completed at the end of 1970, it was touted as a centre with “hawker stalls in a garden setting.” The centre, surrounded by large shady trees, was basically composed of seven structures that had colourful nylon roofs. Each structure hosted eight stalls. This garden concept was part of PM Lee Kuan Yew’s 1967 vision of a clean and beautiful city. He wanted to turn the island into a garden city “within three years”. Accordingly, the government declared that a “floral mile” was to be created from Newton Circus to Clementi Circus, where nurseries would be established to help beautify the island. Hence, the hawker centre was designed with a garden setting that complemented Singapore’s “garden city” image.
Built by the Public Works Department, the centre was the “first hawker stalls [built] in a garden setting”. When completed, it was intended to relocate there 56 hawkers who had been selling food in that part of Bukit Timah Road for years. In early 1977, following its first major renovation to improve its cleanliness, the hawker centre was expanded to allow for additional hawker stalls to accommodate 33 street hawkers from Orchard Road and Marine Parade, and 55 from Joo Chiat and East Coast. By this time, the Hawker Centre had been significantly enlarged.
Newton Circus Hawker Centre had since the 1970s been popular with both tourists and locals for its ambience and great food. In 1978, a stall, specialising in selling oyster omelette, was chosen out of the 88 stalls in Newton Circus hawker centre by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board to run his business at the Rasa Singapura Food Centre at Tanglin.
In 1982, the Environment Ministry found that the Newton Circus food centre was the second most popular eating place in Singapore, just behind Telok Ayer food centre. It had an average of 7,309 patrons daily during peak hours. However, the food centre had also become so “filthy” and deteriorated state that it required renovation. This sprucing up, mainly cosmetic, took place in 1988. In November 1999, the centre underwent another major revamp.
In September 2005, the centre was completely rebuilt. The architects of the new centre took care to create a food centre that was “a throwback” to old times Singapore.” The new stalls were arranged in a horseshoe shape, creating a central courtyard dining space. Palms, nutmeg, pepper and other plants have also been planted around the food centre, many of which would have been found in the colonial-era plantations of this area.   The architects took inspiration from a row of old colonial black-and-white terrace houses in Monk’s Hill Terrace, next to Newton Circus. The new centre housed the same number of stalls as in the old food centre. There were also more seats with 90 per cent of the seating either sheltered or under umbrellas.
In 2016, Newton Circus Food Centre was upgraded once more.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Chinatown-Complex-Market-Food-Centre,"The Kreta Ayer Complex was built in 1981 as a part of the urban renewal of the Chinatown. It was renamed Chinatown Complex in 1984. Hence, when the market and food centre within the complex was completed in that year, it was named Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre. The complex had been a crucial part of the government’s effort to provide a final solution to the thousands of street hawkers who were still plying their trade illegally throughout the streets of Chinatown. As they depended on this trade for their livelihood, it was not a problem the government could solve easily. The establishment of the colossal Chinatown Complex right at the heart of the street hawker district, Smith, Trengganu, Pagoda and Temple Streets, provided the permanent solution.

When the last Chinatown street hawkers moved into the newly completed $18 million complex in October 1983, 300 street hawkers from the surrounding streets were resettled there. This paved the way for the dismantling of all the wooden stalls and shelters that obstructed the roads around, and it was said that, for the first time, the streets were quiet and empty. In reality, the clearance of all the hawkers from the streets allowed the government to thoroughly clean up the district, clearing the drains and eradicating the insects and rodents.
The resettlement of the street hawkers at this time also led to a fear that the government would wipe away years of Chinatown heritage and tradition. The street hawkers had been part of the Chinatown street scene even before World War II, and had become synonymous with the social-cultural identity of the Chinatown district. It was feared that removing the last of them into high-rise food centres and markets would erode the character of what was traditional Chinatown. With this concern in mind, care was given on the architecture of the building, which was designed to blend with the Chinatown streetscape. The new complex is endowed with Chinese elements like pavilions, columns, motifs, arches, clay-tiles, pitch roofs, covered walkways, tall windows and a rooftop garden which was similar to the concept of the courtyard in the old Chinatown buildings.
The market and food centre also has wide thoroughfares on the ground level which provide ample space for mass movement, an important feature during festive times when the place will be overwhelmed. While the food centre is located in the second level, the wet market occupies the basement and the sundry shops are on the ground level. The car park occupies the fourth and fifth levels. The creation of the upper level parking spaces and the basement wet market area had been a crucial part of the design for the complex as it is built in the heart of Singapore’s central district where land is scarce and valuable.
The Housing and Development Board would periodically upgrade the food centre and market in the 1990s to improve the facilities there. In 1991, fixed tables and chairs were installed. In 1996, the centre installed a new sanitation system. Then in 2006, the centre was upgraded once more. When it reopened in 2008, the complex had more than 700 stalls. It was the most extensive upgrading project done by NEA then, and it cost $20.9 million. Through the years, the new complex had been home for all the street hawkers who had been the living heritage of the traditional foods and trade of Chinatown. Many of them had remained at the complex for decades. By 2016, there were still about 20% of the original hawkers who could be found at the cooked food zone of the complex.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Maxwell-Road-Food-Centre,"Maxwell Road Food Centre started as wet market in 1929 dealing mainly with fresh produce. Although it was planned for more than a decade earlier, works on the market started only in 1927. The land on which the market was built had once been a Chinese burial ground which was cleared in 1907. It was only in 1925 that the road next to the future market was laid and named Maxwell Road. It was from then that the intended edifice was called Maxwell Road Market. After the construction works of the main structure had been completed in mid-1928, a tender was then called for the installation of the market’s stalls. The market opened for business in 1929.

However, most of street hawkers intended to be relocated into the new market chose to remain outside the surrounding streets around the market where they did not have to pay any rental. This made situation difficult for those who had taken stalls within the market as they were unable to make any profit with keen competition from the itinerant street hawkers. By late 1929, the market became a “white elephant”. In response, cooked food stalls and eating tables were added a year later. By the late 1930s, the market became a site where Teochew theatrical performances were staged during the annual Hungry Ghost Festivals.
The market remained open during the Japanese Occupation. Interestingly, in an attempt to draw hawkers to the market, the Japanese authorities reduced the rental charges on market stalls and controlled all items on sale.  After World War II, Maxwell Road Market became one of the sites where the government had a “Family Restaurant” that sold cheap meals to thousands of poor and displaced. The Maxwell Market restaurant would be the first of a chain of restaurants selling meals at eight cents that the Singapore Social Welfare Department started across Town from December 1946. It also included a children feeding centre that provided free meals for two to six year olds.
The market underwent several significant changes in the post-war years. In January 1949, the municipality passed a rule that municipal markets could only sell perishable goods. All others vendors, like “bread and provision sellers and money changers”, had to move out by April that year. Maxwell Road Market had two money changers at this time. Then, in 1951, when high food prices became a problem in Singapore, many vendors at Maxwell Road Market were found overcharging. The government implemented measures to control prices at markets facing this problem. In December 1951, the government appointed a firm, Madju Trading Company, to retail beef to markets at 20% below market prices. Maxwell Road Market was among the first three chosen market for this initiative.
Going into the 1960s, although there were ample spaces in 42 public markets, tens of thousands of street hawkers had still decided no remain on the streets. The government markets were at most, only 80% occupied. At Maxwell Road Market, only half the stalls had been taken up. Things only changed in the 1970s, following urban renewal processes in Town. In 1972, when the Telok Ayer Market underwent renovation to be converted into a food centre, 73 of its market produce stalls were relocated to Maxwell Road Market. While on one hand, this became the first time the market had been almost fully occupied, the transference of the market produce vendors to Maxwell Road Market also delayed its own journey towards becoming a food centre.
The first step towards becoming a food centre took place in 1986, when 70 street food hawkers who had been operating under a temporary zinc-and-roof structure along the back lanes around China Square were moved to Maxwell Road Market. They had been operating in the China Street area with makeshift open-aired stalls before being moved to China Square in 1979. Interestingly, these hawkers, the last of the back lane hawkers, had originated from the defunct private Erna Market (1946-48) in Chinatown. At Maxwell Road, they joined 22 other cooked food hawkers. Hence, Maxwell Road Market had been turned into a huge food centre by this time, albeit unplanned. Unfortunately, a couple of years later, all of them had to be moved again when Maxwell itself underwent its own major renovation and transformation.
In 1987, Maxwell Road Market was officially turned into a food centre. Since then, it has become a popular place for traditional Chinese foods.

Walking from one historic site to another is what many tourists enjoy doing whenever they visit a new country. The exploration and discovery of historically significant places enhances one’s understanding of a place’s past, heritage, culture and people.
Since 1999, the National Heritage Board (NHB) has researched on and developed a series of heritage trails in our heartlands that aims to bring heritage closer to the public, and help residents understand and appreciate the place in which they live, study, work and play in. These heritage trails range from heartland areas such as Toa Payoh, Yishun and Bedok to well-known heritage estates such as Balestier, Kampong Glam and Little India.
In 2013, NHB piloted the Heritage Trail Adoption Scheme with Henderson Secondary School. The then newly launched Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail was adopted by the school and 12 pupils were trained by NHB to be student guides. These student guides would later go on to guide the VIP entourage during the trail’s launch.

To promote the use of existing heritage trails and to document the social memories of the estate that we live in, the Heritage Trail Adoption Scheme gives schools the platform to adopt either an NHB heritage trail or a school developed trail for a period of three years. Schools participating in the scheme may choose to undertake the guiding training programme for students or the how-to-teach-guiding training programme designed especially for teachers. The programme also encourages schools to teach heritage in a fun and meaningful way by using the trail for orientation or camp programmes, and to integrate cross-subject learning elements to ensure that the young appreciate the continued relevance of heritage.

Since the programme’s launch up to 2017, more than 25 schools have adopted either an NHB Heritage Trail or a school developed trail, and more than 600 students and 30 teachers have been trained under the programme. Today, the scheme is a robust one with a good spread of participation from primary schools, secondary schools and even tertiary institutions.

Suitable for all ages and student profiles, this scheme has benefited both high-potential and average students by equipping them with life skills that go beyond heritage knowledge. The scheme’s flexibility to be integrated into curriculum has also brought out teachers’ creativity in designing heritage trails that engage students through meaningful exploration and discovery of heritage.

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of Catholic Junior College shares, “The programme has benefited our teachers by equipping them with the knowledge and skills to make learning of heritage and the Mother Tongue Language fun. The programme has also changed our students’ perspectives and understanding towards Balestier. They are now more appreciative of the estate that they study in.”

MuseSG Volume 11 Issue 1 - 2018
Mention Bukit Panjang to any Singaporean and images of a typical Housing & Development Board (HDB) town will likely come to mind. In fact, a peak-hour trip through Bukit Panjang on a Light Rapid Transit (LRT) train will bring one face-to-face with rows of towering residential flats, punctuated occasionally by the odd park or community space. As the train-car glides into Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub, waves of passengers can be glimpsed hurrying along, some bound for the spanking new Hillion Mall. A quick glance, and it is soon apparent that many of these commuters have just arrived via the adjacent Downtown Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Line, returning for a day's work in the city.
Half a century ago, however, the commute to Bukit Panjang would have had been made not in air-conditioned comfort, but in a Vulcan omnibus operated by the Green Bus Company.

Trundling down Upper Bukit Timah Road on bus service No. 2, one would have encountered acres of dense foliage, interspersed with factories belching out thick, grey smoke. Every now and then, a cacophony of intoned hawker voices would have wafted through the bus’ opened windows, as if attempting to compete with the periodic whistle of the Malayan Railway locomotive as it thundered towards the level crossing at Choa Chu Kang Road. As the bus wound around the traffic circus situated where Junction 10 stands today, a mishmash of zinc and brick shophouses would have come into view.

Known colloquially as chap kor  (“tenth mile” in Hokkien), this was Bukit Panjang, a cluster of villages that comprised a few thousand residents during the 1950s.1
What histories were inscribed in the landscape of this seemingly nondescript town; or was it just another town on the byway?
Long before the advent of shopping malls such as Junction 10, “tenth mile” had already been used colloquially to refer to Bukit Panjang. In fact, the origins of both toponyms can be traced to the mid-1800s, when a number of settlements emerged at the 10th milestone of Bukit Timah Road, near a 132-metre hill known as Bukit Panjang (which means “long hill” in Malay).2 Initially inhabited by gambier and pepper planters, these settlements began to expand when Bukit Timah Road was extended northwards to Kranji in 1845. In the process, new forms of economic activity such as rubber cultivation were introduced to Bukit Panjang.3 In 1912, the well-known business magnate Ong Sam Leong was reported to have tapped the first tree at his new Bukit Panjang Rubber Estate, which was located at the 101⁄2 milestone of Bukit Timah Road. That such estates were likely a defining feature of the then Bukit Panjang landscape is also suggested by a Malaya Tribune report of 1916 announcing the auction of another possibly similar rubber and coconut estate at Chua Chu Kang Road near the Bukit Panjang Railway Station.
Situated near today’s Bukit Panjang Post Office, the now defunct Bukit Panjang Railway Station was also integral to the town’s rapid growth in the early 1900s. Constructed as part of the Singapore Railway in 1903, it was by 1912 incorporated into the Federated Malay States Railway. This meant that it would have been possible to proceed by train from Bukit Panjang to Holland Road, Cluny Road or even Kuala Lumpur. According to a notice published in the Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser in 1910, trains were scheduled to call at Bukit Panjang station up to five times daily, carrying not only passengers, but also goods, mail, and even stone from the Mandai Quarry. In fact, an early description of Bukit Panjang as a rather unremarkable locale is provided by a Straits Times reporter covering the opening of the railway line in 1903
The engine whistled shrilly and in a few minutes drew up at Bukit Panjang, a small station not quite complete yet, of the Cluny Road type. Here, some Tamil women were noticed carrying baskets of gravel on their heads, the gravel being spread about the floor of the station. A few Chinese coolies came on board here and the train was soon speeding on its way.
As the town continued to evolve in the decades after, it is likely that the earlier image of Bukit Panjang as just another nondescript town became more an anachronism than a true reflection of its identity. Certainly, residents of Bukit Panjang in the 1950s would have been familiar with an altogether different town than the one described in the Straits Times report of 1903. The Bukit Panjang they would have known, far from being mundane, was brimming with verve and assertiveness, for it was a town which doggedly coupled a can-do ethos with a spirit of mutual help as it confronted the challenges of Singapore’s early nation-building years. No doubt it was roiled, at times, by the turbulent socio-political currents of the era, but this itself ensured that residents of Bukit Panjang forged a distinct collective identity defined by a strong sense of esprit de corps. Testament to the fact that this spirit of camaraderie was no myth, but was indeed being tangibly expressed, is a speech by the then acting Colonial Secretary J. D. Higham to the newly- formed Bukit Panjang Youth Club in 1954. Praising the club’s community centeredness, he pronounced with more than a sliver of prescience, that in Bukit Panjang “there is already a sense of belonging to a group”, from which he predicted would “grow [the] most fruitful movements”.
Part of the reason why a spirit of collegial solidarity began to take root so strongly in Bukit Panjang was the fact that the trunk road which brought development to the town was also the same feature that separated it by ten miles from the city. Indeed, a Singapore Free Press report of 1955 could not resist describing Bukit Panjang as the “vegetable basket” of Singapore – a “far off rural constituency of bullock-cart trails, away from the hurly-burly of city life”. Given this description, one can perhaps understand why residents of Bukit Panjang often came together to fend for themselves, especially in instances when help seemed distant, delayed or deficient. In 1957, for example, the Singapore Improvement Trust launched Bukit Panjang Estate (later renamed Teck Whye Estate), which comprised some 200 single-storey terrace houses.

Branded as a low-cost alternative for workers employed in the Bukit Timah area, the houses were touted in the local press as being “excellent shield[s] against heat and cold”, with their construction even bearing the approval stamp of a United Nations expert. Yet, by 1958, tenants were being told tartly by the trust’s chairman, J. M. Fraser, that they had to “help themselves” when they appealed for assistance to fix asbestos roofs that were producing oven-like indoor temperatures of 38 degrees celsius. In a Straits Times article from 1958, Fraser was even reported to have told tenants that the trust was “charging you a favourable rent which isn’t even economical for us”. Furious tenants, miffed that their petitions had been ignored, were reported to have organised a meeting at the Bukit Panjang Community Centre to decide on a course of action.4 Perhaps not coincidentally, within two weeks of the meeting, the matter was raised for discussion in the then Legislative Assembly.5
At times, the collective indignation felt by residents and workers of Bukit Panjang towards social injustice was so intense that meetings gave way to strikes, and petitions came to be substituted with the picket. Situated where Tan Chong Industrial Park is standing today, the Nanyang Shoe Factory – where many womenfolk from Bukit Panjang were reputed to have worked – was one compound beset by numerous strikes in the 1950s and 1960s. Although the charged political atmosphere of the day no doubt influenced strikers’ demands, newspaper reports from the era also reveal that on most occasions the strikers’ grievances stemmed from prosaic bread-and-butter concerns: the desire for a 50-cent wage raise or for overtime allowance to be granted. Industrial action undertaken was thus not necessarily always the handiwork of disruptive elements, but could well have been prompted by workers uniting to seek redress for injustices such as the refusal of a company to pay arrears. Chua Beng Tee, who witnessed many such strikes, recalls that “in the past, people took action once they felt aggrieved, no matter if it was a minor issue. That’s much less likely to happen today!”6
While a lively sense of disaffection certainly permeated through the Bukit Panjang of the 1950s and 1960s, more often than not the response it prompted amongst residents was a spirited attempt to channel this restiveness for a greater good. Bukit Panjang Community Centre, in particular, stood out for its many initiatives that attempted to tackle issues of both local and national dimensions. In 1955, the centre organised Singapore’s inaugural district horti-agricultural show, which included demonstrations for farmers, displays of crops, and even advice for carp breeders. At the show’s opening, then Chief Minister David Marshall publicly commended Bukit Panjang Community Centre for their public spirit in organising such an event, which he opined was “of great assistance”.

Not to be outdone, the community centre further down at Jalan Kong Kuan was also reported to have organised its fair share of charitable activities, on occasion using the Sin Wah Theatre near Lorong Ah Thia to screen shows as part of its fund-raising programmes.

Beyond the walls of such community institutions, it would be remiss to disregard the many instances in which this sense of public-spiritedness found expression through ground-up grassroots initiatives, pursued by ordinary Bukit Panjang residents of all races and creeds. A particularly revealing case involves the former Lembaga Masjid Jamik, which in 1960 began a building fund drive to build a mosque in Bukit Panjang, as the next nearest mosque was some seven miles away. Not content with merely raising funds, more than 100 volunteers from Bukit Panjang came together as part of a self-styled “Operation Masjid”, helping to clear the site on which the mosque would be constructed. The mosque, originally named Jamek Mosque, was subsequently renamed Al-Khair in 1963, and continues to serve the Muslim community at 1 Teck Whye Crescent today.
Over at Bukit Panjang Government High School, which was established as Bukit Panjang Secondary School in 1957, students who had barely turned 13 banded together when they arrived at their new school premises in Jalan Teck Whye in 1959 to find that there were no desks and chairs.7 Professor Low Cheng Hock, who was amongst the school’s first batch of students, recalls how all the students rushed to help carry the school furniture from a lorry when it arrived two weeks later. As weeks passed, the entire cohort even transformed the barren land behind the school into a proper field by planting grass seeds and nurturing it with cow dung.8

Peh Ching Boon, who attended the school in the 1960s, also discovered how valuable the close-knit ties amongst Bukit Panjang residents could be when on one occasion, a handful of students mischievously released the air valve of his bicycle’s tyres. Fortunately, he was spared a trek home by virtue of his uncle’s friendship with the school’s doctor, who brought him to a nearby shop to repair the leak. Moreover, he was even told he could henceforth park his bicycle outside the Principal’s office!9

Fast forward to today, the Bukit Panjang of the mid-20th century is scarcely recognisable amidst the rows of towering HDB flats. Nonetheless, a spirit of camaraderie continues to flourish amidst the high-rise urbanscape, testifying to the esprit de corps so strongly embedded in the town’s heritage.

For example, even as new initiatives such as community gardens have emerged, longstanding community institutions such as the Bukit Panjang Youth Club continue to flourish too, with the latter even pioneering signature programmes such as FoodNotes, a youth-led food donation drive for the needy.

Emblematic of the extent to which Bukit Panjang has managed to carve out a distinct identity is perhaps the sheer fact that its place-name continues to be used widely amongst Singaporeans, in lieu of the less familiar “Zhenghua”. In fact, “Zhenghua” had been chosen to replace “Bukit Panjang” as part of a government initiative in the 1980s to rechristen towns with “pinyinised” toponyms, but the original place-name was reinstated after a spirited public debate (Bukit Panjang was the only town in Singapore in which a reversal of the policy was effected).10 On hindsight, one can surmise from the episode that Singaporeans are, without a doubt, cognisant of the importance of place identities and histories, and how these work in concert to distinguish places like Bukit Panjang from being mere towns on the byway. In the words of geographers Brenda Yeoh and Lily Kong, it is only logical that:
Place and history are closely intertwined in the rich texture of individual and social life. There is no history without place, and no place without history; to lose sight of one would be to lose a sense of the other.11

Notes"
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/We-built-a-nation/We-Built-a-Nation,"Singapore became an independent country following its exit from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. Thrust into nationhood amid a volatile regional climate plagued by conflict (Indonesia was waging an undeclared war, the Konfrontasi, to oppose the formation of Malaysia), Singapore’s founding generation of leaders focused on cohesiveness to ensure its survival. In the words of Singapore’s first President Mr Yusof Ishak “If we are to remain a cohesive people, we must concentrate on the factors which bind us together, and not those which will divide us.""
This ideal set the tone for the policies made during Singapore’s first decade of independence. Its founding generation of leaders, led by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew strove to build a multiracial and multicultural society that accorded equality to all citizens regardless of race, language or religion. These policies, especially in the areas of defence, housing, education and economy, have helped to lay the foundations of the Singapore that we know today.

Mr Rajaratnam said in a Parliamentary speech in 1967: “In a democracy, there can be no distinction between majority rights and minority rights. There can only be equality of rights, the same rights for all, without regard to race, colour, language or creed.” (Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore)
Building up a capable defence force
As a newly independent nation in a turbulent region, Singapore now had some responsibility for its defence and had to move quickly to develop a capable defence force. Defence Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee was given the monumental task of building up its defence force. The People’s Defence Force (PDF), a part-time paramilitary unit was established in 1965 and by March 1966, some 3,200 volunteers registered with the PDF.

However, the lack of military training and small numbers of the PDF, coupled with the impending withdrawal of British troops led Dr Goh to conclude that compulsory conscription was needed to meet Singapore’s defence needs. The British had implemented a National Service Bill in 1954. However, large-scale protests by Chinese middle school students led to the Colonial government postponing its implementation. The was re-introduced when Dr Goh announced that a pioneer batch of 9,000 youths were eligible for National Service call-ups during the second reading of the National Service (Amendment) Bill on 13 March 1967.

Dr Goh positioned National Service (NS) as a form of nation-building. In a parliamentary speech, Dr Goh said: “Nothing creates loyalty and national consciousness more speedily and more thoroughly than participation in defence and membership of the armed forces.” While street demonstrations opposing the call-ups were staged, there was much stronger support for NS this time around, in part due to the support of University of Singapore Student Union and Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
To date, more than one million male Singaporeans and second-generation permanent residents have served NS in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force or Singapore Civil Defence Force. NS is now seen as a rite of passage for all Singaporean males.
Housing a nation
Another challenge that Singapore’s founding leaders had to overcome during its early years was housing a growing population. The Housing Development Board (HDB) was formed shortly after Singapore attained self-government in February 1960. Led by their first chairman Lim Kim San, HDB built 31,317 flats in three years. This is in stark contrast with the 23,019 housing units HDB’s predecessor, the Singapore Improvement Trust, built during their 32 years of existence.

Developing our Economy
The 1961 State Development Plan was the first official blueprint for Singapore’s economic development following our attainment of self-governance in 1959. The plan involved labour-intensive factories as well as technology-intensive investments such as oil refineries. The four-year plan aimed to end economic stagnation and reduce the high unemployment rate by expanding manufacturing.
Following Singapore’s independence, its founding leaders made it a priority to focus on industrialisation. Singapore was at a disadvantage due to its small domestic market and lack of natural resources. These factors, coupled with Singapore’s separation from Malaysia – ending all hopes of a common market ­– led the government to adopt an export-orientated development strategy which also included attracting multinational corporations to establish manufacturing bases in Singapore.
PM Lee said: “We had one simple guiding principle for survival: that Singapore had to be more rugged, better organised and more efficient than others in the region. If we were only as good as our neighbours there was no reason for businesses to be based here. We had to make it possible for investors to operate successfully and profitably in Singapore despite our lack of a domestic market and natural resources.”
By the 1970s, the manufacturing sector evolved to attract higher-end investments such as those from the electronics sector. Singapore registered a strong gross domestic product growth and achieved nearly full employment by the mid-1970s. Wages and the standard of living also rose correspondingly.

Reforming the education system
Singapore’s founding leaders also emphasised the importance of investing in its future generations. The government introduced education policies to support national integration and nation-building. Every child would be provided with at least six years of education from the age of six – without discrimination based on race, language, sex, wealth or status. The Compulsory Education Act of 2000 eventually made six years of primary education mandatory for all children born after 1st January 1996.

A key facet of Singapore’s education system is the policy of bilingualism, which was launched for primary level in 1960 and secondary level in 1966. Students learn two languages: English, which is used as a working language that enables people from different ethnic backgrounds to communicate with each other, and an additional second language (either Mandarin, Malay or Tamil), which in 1979 was specified as the student’s official mother tongue for them to remain connected with their ethnic group’s cultural roots.
Laying a strong foundation
The progress made during its first 10 years of independence laid a strong foundation for Singapore’s transformation from a nation that many did not expect to survive into the Singapore that we know today – a thriving, first-world country, a Singapore for Singaporeans.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Changi-Village-Hawker-Centre,"The Changi Village Hawker Centre was built in 1975 as part of the government’s initiative to create a leisure and recreation district at the far flung eastern end of the island. Changi Point had been an idyllic village in the pre-war years when the British military moved in to set up bases. From 1927, a local settlement sprang up near these camps to cater to the needs of these military men and their families. It became their place of their recreation and provision shopping outside the camps. This enterprise became Changi Village.

After World War II, Changi Village continued its pre-war function as an off-base suburbia for the British troops stationed at Changi. The community had been a multicultural one, and the 1960s, they had all been part of the retail establishment that made Changi Village a convenient market place for the British military at Changi. By this time, Changi Village was also well-known for its cheap buys and a place for bargain hunters. In the 1960s, there was also a (street) “market” in the village with an open space that the Ministry of Culture screened movies for the villagers. There was also an “Amah’s Market” at Changi Village every Wednesday night when the shopkeepers brought down prices to compete with the market stallholders.
Then everything changed after 1967 when the British announced their withdrawal from Singapore by 1972. By 1971, after tens of thousands of British servicemen and dependants have mostly gone, the once blooming suburbia had become a struggling kampong. This was when the Singapore Government introduced plans to reinvent Changi Village, and the hawker centre was born as part of this initiative.
The plan was to create a population catchment in the district and to make the Changi Village a magnet for locals and tourists. While creating light industries in the Loyang area and the establishment of New Towns in the eastern part of the island would meet the first objective, the development of recreational areas in the district would complete the second. However, by 1973, the government found that the whole undertaking needed a further boost. Changi Point was turned into a resort destination in order to give the district “a new lease of life”, and a part of this new plan was to build a new housing estate at Changi Village with a modern market and hawker centre.
The new hawker centre was completed in 1975. By 1976, a cooked food centre with 74 stalls and a market with 78 stalls were operational. By the 1980s, the new hawker centre was most crowded during lunch time. It was thronged by soldiers and air force personnel from nearby camps, workers from the airport and the Loyang Industrial Estate. There were also the holiday-makers from the numerous holiday bungalows at Changi Point. In the evening, nearby residents formed the bulk of Changi Village’s patrons.
However, business volume at the new Changi Village did not return to the levels when the British military was still around. The shopkeepers around the market who returned when the new HDB blocks were built had also found the going tough.
By 2000, Changi Village Hawker Centre had become dated and required repairs. This was its first major revamp. The centre underwent another revamp a decade later in 2012 when it was closed for 10 months for upgrading.
Changi Village Hawker Centre shares a number of similarities with the other centres built during the 1970s. Like the centre at the East Coast Lagoon, it was also created with the intent of making it part of a seaside resort. And like the Lagoon, the centre struggled through the 1980s from low business volume.
Today, Changi Village Hawker Centre has become a dining place set within a laid back suburbia environ, where patrons of come for its popular cuisine which include the nasi lemak (Malay fragrant rice dish). In the evenings, crowds gather here to hang out and have their favourite foods and drinks. Despite renovations over the years, the hawker centre has retained its old charm and laid-back atmosphere. It has become an iconic part of Changi and a convenient stopover for weekend fishing enthusiasts from the region, as well as locals holidaying at the bungalows nearby.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Blk-51-Old-Airport-Road,"Old Airport Road Food Centre was built in 1972 to resettle street hawkers found all around Kallang Estate. This estate was created following the closure of Kallang Airport in 1955. After which, the Singapore Improvement Trust built low-cost housing in the district to accommodate squatters who had been cleared from the Town areas. The area on which this new estate was constructed was actually the old airport’s runway. This became the Kallang Airport Estate. A market was also erected as part of the estate’s development. Initially called the Jalan Empat Market, it was later renamed Kallang Estate Fresh Market & Food Centre.

When it was completed in 1958, it provided the estate with 172 stalls for fresh and cooked foods. Yet, by the 1960s, these stalls were inadequate to accommodate all the street hawkers who had gathered at the estate. In response, the government erected sheltered pitches all around the market in 1963. The makeshift measure expanding the market added spaces for 315 additional hawkers. This essentially doubled the number of stalls at the market. However, there was still a need for a more permanent solution to the hawker problem at Kallang.
The solution was found in 1972 with the building of Old Airport Road Hawker Centre as part of the Kallang Airport Estate Redevelopment Scheme. The new facility was an Emporium-cum-Hawker Centre with food stalls on the ground floor and shopping on the upper levels of the building. When it was completed, it was considered the most modern hawker centre, which had incorporated the latest architectural designs.
The new hawker centre, costing $2.5 million, accommodated 176 food stalls on its ground floor and 136 shop units on its upper floor. It was built as part of the government’s 1970s plan to relocate street hawkers into purpose-built food centers which had no wet market attached. Also, in terms of design, the Old Airport Road Food Centre reflected same design of those food centres erected in New Towns of the 1960s and 1970s, like those at Woodlands and Commonwealth Avenue. These hawker centres were by and large flat roofed and had two-levels to cater to the needs of a densely populated district.
However, unlike the other flat roof two-level hawker centres of the time, the food centre at Old Airport Road had enough space to serve other public and “civic functions”. Besides the emporium on level two, the also had a Post Office branch and a POSB ATM.
Right from the start, the new food centre became a haunt for diners in search of the best local foods. The hawker centre’s proximity to the city also made it a convenient supper stopover for revellers after a night out in town. Through the years, 51 Old Airport Road has become famous for being one of the best places to eat at reasonable prices. In recent years, the food centre also started seeing more tourists visiting.
In 1973, a hawker stall in the centre, Khoon Kee Chicken Rice, won the very first competition for the “Cleanest Cooked Food Stall” in Singapore, sponsored by the Rotary Club.
The food centre underwent upgrading between 2006 and 2007. The facelift, which cost the NEA $5.8 million, was its largest upgrading initiatives under the Hawker Centre Upgrading Programme till that point in time. Being a widely patronised hawker centre, the seating capacity was increased to 1904 with the addition of new dining areas. By this time, the second level also accommodated a kindergarten.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Chomp-Chomp-Food-Centre,"Created at the heart of Serangoon Gardens Estate in 1972, Chomp Chomp Food Centre is a part of the district’s suburbia charm. The estate was established in the 1950s by a private developer who built over a former rubber plantation and Chinese kampong. When completed in 1956, Serangoon Gardens provided accommodation for the English-speaking middle-class civil servants of Singapore.

It did not take too long for street hawkers to make a beeline for the newly opened estate. By 1960, the middle of the district had been so congested by food hawkers that clashes arose. A year later, the government built the residents of the Serangoon Garden Estate their first market. Yet, the street hawkers proliferated and many of them set up their stalls around an empty piece of land in front of the Serangoon Garden Circus, between Farleigh Avenue and Serangoon Garden Way (at the present-day bus-stop). Again, the limited space led to clashes. Following this, 30 hawkers from the site were relocated to the nearby Maju Avenue where they set up sheds on both sides of the road. The original empty ground was then paved and transformed into an “eating esplanade” where 25 street hawkers plied their trade. These were the hawkers who would eventually become the pioneers of Chomp Chomp.
Chomp Chomp was finally built on a piece of ground along Kensington Park Road, opposite the “eating esplanade”. In May 1972, Chomp Chomp Hawker Centre was officially opened by then then Minster for Law and National Development, E W Barker. It was the third of the purpose-built hawker centres which not attached to any market then, and after Serangoon Gardens, there were plans to build six more these kind of hawker centres in Singapore. Chomp Chomp was also one of the four projects started by the then MP for Serangoon Garden and Parliamentary Secretary of Home Affairs, L P Rodrigo, for his constituency. The hawkers who had their stalls at the “eating esplanade” were moved to Chomp Chomp when it opened. Built at cost of $95,000, the new hawker centre opened with 36 built-in stalls, with sinks, wash basins and electric neon lights at each stall. The stallholders had to provide their own tables and chairs for their customers and they had to move them whenever it rained. The tables and chairs were kept and stored in their stalls at the end of the day.
The English name of the hawker centre was actually a loose adaptation of its Teochew name, Tiong Tiong. The Mandarin equivalent is zhong zhong, which Chinese characters stood for loyalty and righteousness. The name Chomp Chomp was chosen by the committee the hawkers had formed among themselves. Boys from Serangoon Garden Secondary School helped put up the “Chomp Chomp” signboard at the front of the centre. Chomp Chomp was also officially known as the Serangoon Garden Food Centre.
Over time, Chomp Chomp became a very popular visit for locals and tourists alike. One reason for its success during its early years was because it was well supported by the children in the schools of the area. There was also a movie theatre nearby. They had formed a significant client base for the hawker centre. By 1987, Chomp Chomp was touted as one of the five most popular food centres with highest business volume on the island. It came alive in the evenings when diners thronged the place for their dinner and supper.
In 1996, most of the stallholders of Chomp Chomp went from being renters to becoming owners of their own stalls in the hawker centre under the government’s Stall Ownership Scheme. Following this, Chomp Chomp received a new roof in 1998. The Environment Ministry (ENV) built a roof over the customer seating areas. After the centre reopened in April 1998, customers were no longer subjected to the elements while they dined. Together with other renovations, the 1998 upgrading cost $265,000. Chomp Chomp underwent another upgrading in 2003 to make its outlook “fit in with the rest of the upgraded estate”.
Today, Chomp Chomp remains one of the most popular local eateries. It was voted Singaporeans’ favourite hawker centre in 2011, 2012 and 2013 by the City Hawker Food Hunt.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Tekka-Market,"When Tekka Market was built in 1915, it was first called the Kandang Kerbau Market, taking the name of the district which was associated with the cattle and meat trade. The south Indians called the market “Mattu Kampong Pasar” in Tamil, a literal translation from the Malay name.
Plans for the market could be traced back to 1909 when the municipality decided to develop the whole area as part of the Kampong Kapor Improvement Scheme. Hence, when works started, the surrounding shophouses were also erected around the same time. One of these is today’s Little India Arcade, completed in 1913. The market was completed later as the grounds on which the market was to be erected had to be purchased from the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowment Board at a cost of $25,000 and there was a general lack of funds at that time. After the mounting of the steel structures in 1913, there was a pause in works till the municipality awarded a contract of $30,000 to complete the market building. By July 1915, the market was completed and had opened in the first week of august. The Municipal Engineer who designed the market was Robert Peirce. He gave the market a colonial outlook with multiple archway and ornate steel carvings.
By the 1930s, Kandang Kerbau Market was famed for having been the “people’s market”. It was popular with all the different ethnic groups for its wide variety of fresh meat, vegetables and seafood, as well as the retail goods that were sold there.
During the Japanese Occupation years, Kandang Kerbau Market become a distribution centre for the fruits and vegetable grown at Bahau (Negri Sembilan), a food growing colony the Japanese started with Singapore residents resettled there. In August 1944, the market was also made a distribution centre for newly hatched chicks which were given to the people of the area to rear so that they could help manage their own food requirements. 
After the war, the market was supposed to be fully rehabilitated. However, the government lacked funds as everything had to be rebuilt and repaired at the same time. Hence, when the extension of the market was proposed in 1948, the municipality decided that it was cheaper to repair and redecorate the market instead. And even after a budget was set aside for this in 1948, funds meant for the fencing of Maxwell Road Market had to be diverted to complete the works at Kandang Kerbau Market.
Times were harsh in the post-war days. Yet, it was during this time that the stallholders of the market formed amongst themselves, the Kandang Kerbau Market Dealers’ Association. In 1952, the association got together to donate their produce to the Little Sisters of the Poor who were supporting others who were in more difficulties than them.
By the 1960s-70s, the area around the market had been inundated by illegal street hawkers. There was just not enough space in the market to accommodate all 400 of them. The market at this time had housed 300 vendors. In 1971, as quick fix, the government licenced all the hawkers outside the market for four years. This was ironically, an unintended long waited “extension” of the market.  
By the mid-1970s, it was clear that the whole Kampong Kapor district needed renewal. The Kandang Kerbau Complex was conceived as a replacement for the market. The new site, situated across the road, started ground works in August 1979. The new Market was completed by early 1981 and the stallholders moved in on 3 May 1981.
Designed as a residential-cum-shopping complex with three tower blocks of residential flats and a market on the ground level, the development marked the first step towards the redevelopment of the world district. When the new market was opened, it was initially called Buffalo Road Market and Cook Food Centre. Then in November 1981, as part of the national Speak Mandarin Campaign and movement to “hanyu-pinyinize” place names in Singapore, it was renamed Zhujiao Centre. This was met with some disquiet among some residents of the district as could not identify the heritage of the district with the Mandarin name. The new complex was then renamed Tekka Centre in 2000.
Many of the stallholders at old Tekka Market are second or third generation hawkers whose forefathers set up shop in the old market 30 to 50 years ago.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Peoples-Park-Food-Centre,"The People’s Park Food Centre had its beginnings as a humble “food shelter” set up by the municipality in 1923 to provide cover for street hawkers in the area. The first shelter had proven to be so popular amongst the hawkers that within months after its opening, more were added and the municipality “turned” it into a market. By 1930, such was its success that it was made into a day and night market. From then, it continued growing. By 1940, the market had 323 stalls, making it Singapore’s largest market then. It was during this time that the market had become famous for its durian stalls, which remained open until 2 am for fruit lovers. It was this legacy that made it Singapore's first and oldest pasar malam (“night market” in Malay).

The market did not close during the Japanese Occupation. In 1944, the People’s Park Market was chosen by the Japanese as one of several chick distribution centres in Town. The programme was designed to help people rear their own chicken in order for them to manage their own food supply.
The old market was divided into many tall sheds which rested on cemented platforms raised slightly above ground level. It had two sections (front and back), separated by a metallic fence. The stalls in the front was where the dry goods were and the wet-market stalls were at the back. The wet market’s entrance faced the side of the Majestic Theatre. After the end of the Japanese Occupation, the stalls at the front continued their business while the wet market behind was moved.  In its place, a textiles bazaar arose. Many of the post-war stallholders had plied their trade at temporary markets in Town which were started soon after the British return. By late 1940s, the municipality demolished most of them and relocated them in municipal markets. Many of them were given spaces at People’s Park Market. By 1949, the market had 984 stalls engaged in day and night hawking.
In 1957, the People’s Park Market reached another landmark when the Singapore Agricultural Co-operative Union, which comprised of all vegetable growers in Singapore, started a wholesale market there. This meant that the vegetables at the market came directly from the Singapore farms, making them cheaper and fresher. 
Everything changed in December 1966 when a great fire wiped out 186 stalls and shops, causing a million dollars in damages. This unintentionally brought forward the government’s plan to rebuild the People’s Park Market as part of the district’s urban renewal. Some of the stallholders had already been served notices to quit prior to the fire.
A temporary market adjacent to the fire area was built in 1967 to house all the stalls during the rebuilding. In this way, they would not lose their loyal customers, many of whom were tourists who had come to the market to buy Indian and Japanese textiles. This temporary “shopping centre” was called the Singapore People’s Park Textiles and Sundries New Market.
By mid-1969, the first phase of Singapore’s then biggest “shopping cum residential complex”  had been completed and the shops and stallholders started moving in and commenced business. At this time, the eateries were already touted as a “favourite of Singaporeans”. When completed, the new three-storey complex (not including the housing block above), had lifts but no escalators as yet. While the food stalls, 75 in all, were located on the first level, the retail and textiles shops occupied the second and third levels. By this time, the food centre had become a favourite visit of many tourists from Southeast Asia.
One important legacy from the old days which was brought to the new complex was the “no free seating” issue at the food centre. In the old market, stallholders had to provide their own tables and chairs. Naturally, these were meant for their own patrons. Interestingly, this continued at the new market and faced many complaints. The matter was only put to rest in 1992 when the government installed fixed tables and chairs.
The first major upgrading renovation People’s Park Centre underwent occurred in February 2005. The $5 million endeavour made the centre “greener, cooler and brighter”. The upgrading was done as part of the National Environment Agency's Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme. There were 89 food stalls and 80 retail outlets in the upper levels of the centre before the facelift. After the upgrading, the centre had 85 food stalls and around 160 shops on the upper levels.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Hawker-Centres/Tiong-Bahru-Market-Food-Centre,"The popular Tiong Bahru Market opened in 1951 as Seng Poh Road Market. It was then just “a simple wooden structure with zinc pitched roof”. Named after the street commemorating Singapore’s first Chinese Municipal Commissioner, Tan Seng Poh, the market was built to house a large number of street hawkers who had served the rapidly growing community at Tiong Bahru. It became an instant draw for the residents, many of whom had relocated from Chinatown.

Many of the first vendors of the market were stallholders of an earlier “temporary” market which was built in 1940. It was just a series of sheds which had become an eyesore, a fire hazard, and far too small for the needs of the Tiong Bahru residents by the late 1940s. The estate had been growing steadily. In 1948, the government started building more than a dozen additional SIT blocks in the district which were ready for occupation from mid-1949. In September 1949, new plans were made to erect a further 18 blocks of flats in Tiong Bahru and Alexander Estates. By December 1949, the municipality decided that it was time to erect a permanent and larger market for the estate along Seng Poh Road.
Works on the new market started in 1950 and it was completed by the end of that year. Officially named the Seng Poh Road Market, it was built to allow for cooked food stalls. In those early days, the new market also functioned as a kind of “Town Hall”, where important meeting were held and attended by residents of the district. The first of such gatherings occurred in March 1951 when the “town” gathered to decide on the establishment of a community centre for Tiong Bahru. It became a Polling Centre for the 1951 Legislative Council elections, and in 1953, it played the same role for the City Council elections. In the 1960s, political rallies were held there.
By the 1970s, the old market was in great need of repair, looking old and dirty, there were also street hawkers lining its pavements. A decade later, besides serving the residents of the estate, the cooked food stalls in the market had also become important to, and a favourite of, a large number of nurses (from SGH) in the morning and office workers during lunch time. The old market was fundamentally a single-storey building with a triangular layout and had more than one entrances. The cooked food stalls were along the length of the back as well as taking up the whole of the right hand corner of the market. The food centre was arranged courtyard-style with the stalls ringing a central courtyard. The food centre, located outside the back of the market, was officially called Lim Liak Street Hawker Centre (Block 84A). When the whole market was revamped in 1993, it was renamed Tiong Bahru Market.
The biggest change for Tiong Bahru Market took place in 2004-06 when the market and food centre were closed and a new building was erected. The new centre has also been endowed with user-friendly features with lifts, escalators and bigger stalls. Parts of the new building also incorporated an Art Deco style to complement the architecture of the surrounding estate.
The Tiong Bahru Market & Food Centre is a two-storey building with a large central garden courtyard on a triangulated site. The fresh market, located on the first level, consists of 255 provision shops and wet produce stalls. The provision shops lining the peripheries help to enclose the morning wet produce market from the main road and generate night life to the building as they close late. The food court on the second level houses 85 food stalls surrounding pockets of eating spaces, with a seating capacity of 1,050. There is an urban park and garden as well as car parking facilities at the roof deck. All floors are handicapped accessible.
Since the 1970s, the market and food court had already became known for its tradition foods, “specialising in Chinese breakfast foods and local specialities”. The market had food items which were not part of the “normal market breakfast repertoire” such as Cantonese chee cheong fun and wu thow kou. There was only one Malay stall at that time.

Before he was president, Yusof Ishak (12 August 1910–23 November 1970) was a weightlifting champion, boxer extraordinaire and dedicated newspaperman. Today, we remember his life and imprint on society via a currency series which features his portrait.
Champion weightlifter and budding journalist
Singapore’s first president, Yusof Ishak, was already capturing headlines in his youth. His victory at the 1932 Aw Boon Par Cup for boxing, and his subsequent success as national lightweight champion in weightlifting, earned him mentions in the press.
Yusof who attended Victoria Bridge School (Victoria School) and later Raffles Institution, had moved to the island from Perak with his family in 1923.2 Academically brilliant, he earned distinctions in his Cambridge examinations and only narrowly missed out on the highly coveted Queen’s Scholarship.3

Apart from sports, Yusof ventured into journalism, taking on the role of co-editor at the Rafflesian, a magazine at his school.

Yusof was eager to pursue law, however, his family could not afford to send him abroad to further his studies.4
Establishing a newspaper for the Malays
Yusof did a brief stint with the Police Academy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia before returning to Singapore to carve out a career in journalism.
Together with friends Ong Chin Beng and Soh Swee Tuck, Yusof started a fortnightly magazine called Sportsman which married his two interests — athletics and journalism.
Later, he joined Warta Malaya, a newspaper owned by the Alsagoffs — a wealthy Arab family. Starting off as a clerk, he rose through its ranks and became its acting editor.
His experience at the Muslim-oriented paper sparked his desire to launch a more Malay-centric publication run and owned by Malays. Together with Abdul Rahim Kajai and about 20 other Malay community leaders, he set up the Utusan Melayu at Queen Street.
Yusof was 27 at the time. To finance the newspaper, he worked the ground, selling shares to members of the Malay community in Singapore and southern Johor. He was also responsible for assembling a capable team of journalists and editors, and sourcing for advertisers as well as equipment, among other responsibilities.
The paper, which had its first print run in May 1939, faced a number of challenges including stiff competition from rival publications. Yusof resigned from the publication around the time political party United Malays National Organisation started buying shares in the company.5
Becoming president
Yusof’s passion for the Malay community and desire to serve his land, caught the eye of Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who invited him to chair the city’s Public Service Commission in 1959.6
Within the same year he was appointed Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore, or head of state following the People’s Action Party’s landslide election victory in 1959.
In 1959, Singapore achieved self-governance, a milestone this souvenir plate commemorates. As part of the city’s transition from British to local hands, colonial governor William Goode was replaced by Yusof Ishak.7
He also became Singapore’s first president after the Republic gained independence in 1965. His promotion of multiracialism helped generate confidence in the new nation and regime.8 Like his early career in the newspaper business, Yusof took to walking the ground, calming nerves and explaining the rationale behind separation from Malaysia.9

Dutiful and steadfast in his role as Singapore’s president, Yusof passed on from heart failure in 1970 while still in office, leaving behind his wife Puan Noor Aishah and their three children.10
Yusof is remembered lovingly in a number of ways today. For instance, his genial portrait graces a currency series which has been in circulation since 1999.11 A mosque, think-tank and professorship were also named after him in the 2010s.12

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/street-names-in-singapore/story,"TL;DR
Oxford Street, Auckland Road, Mandalay Road. Dozens of streets in Singapore bear the names of iconic places in the Commonwealth, reflecting the city’s roots as a British colony. Other road names here draw inspiration from our rich culture and everyday life. Vested with meaning and encoded with our unique DNA, the names of our streets serve as accessible starting points to revisit and unpack the city’s rich repository of stories. “Travel” back in time with us as we take you on a brief journey of Singapore’s toponymics.
Mapping out early Singapore
As soon as the British arrived, they started building roads to support the rapid development of the new trading post. In the early years, place names were very practical in nature which gave rise to sites like Commercial Square, Market Street and Hospital Road.1
A view of Commercial Square during the 1860s. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Irishman G. D. Coleman was assigned by the British to conduct Singapore’s first official topographical survey. Completed in 1829, the survey captures early road infrastructure such as Flint Street, Circular Road and Tanjong Pagar Road.2 (Image from the National Archives of Singapore)
During subsequent stages of town planning, the city was divided into racial and occupational quarters, as per the instructions of Sir Stamford Raffles.3 Published in 1828,4 the plan comprised zones such as Kampong Glam for Bugis and Arabs merchants, land upstream of the Singapore River for the Chulias, and space southwest of the Singapore River for the Chinese.5 As the colony developed, marshes, swamps and jungle were cleared. In turn, more roads were carved out. Among them: Queen Street, Coleman Street and Pickering Street — all of which were named after prominent British figures and officials.6
The names of community leaders such as Lim Nee Soon (12 November 1879-20 March 1936) were also etched onto street signs. Lim, known for his rubber empire, has a record number of streets named after him — a staggering 26.7 Lim had acquired and leased large tracts of land along the Seletar River area within the boundaries of present-day Yishun, for his rubber business.7
In all, just 40 of 540 road names, as compiled in the book Toponymics: A Study of Singapore Street Names, are named after women. Jalan Hajijah is one of them. It was named after a heiress known as Hajjah Hajijah who founded a Malay kampung on land she had purchased off Upper East Coast Road.9 The kampung, likely established in the 1900s, had about 30 houses. It was demolished in the 1980s.10
Some place names reflected economic activities in the area. For instance, the cultivation of lemongrass plants gave rise to the name Geylang Serai. Serai means lemongrass in Malay.
It was the same for Dhoby Ghaut. Dhobis or laundrymen could often be found knee-deep in the freshwater stream now known as Stamford Canal washing bundles of garments. The washermen utilised a plot of land nearby to dry the clothes. Ghaut or ghatin in Hindi refers to the area along a riverbank used for bathing or washing.
A 2ha plot of land (on the right) where dhobis (washermen) dried their clients’ laundry.
The local populace put their own spin on some of these assigned names. For instance, they preferred to call Chinatown’s Kreta Ayer (water cart in Malay) goo cia chwee in Hokkien. The name translates to “bullock cart water”, a direct reference to the bullock carts which used to supply the area with fresh water.11
Within British military camps and compounds, roads were named after famous British streets. Some posit that it was a way to help servicemen deal with homesickness.
We’ve also “borrowed” place names from the region resulting in Tanjong Katong’s Ipoh Lane (Malaysia), Bencoolen Street (Indonesia) in the Bras Basah area, Little India’s Madras Road (India), as well as Mandalay Road (Myanmar) in Novena.12
Post-independence naming conventions
Singapore began to shape its own toponymic policies after independence and the decision was made to retain colonial-era road names.13 It was too disorienting to do an overhaul. It also did not make much sense to wipe out Singapore’s past in one fell swoop.14
Nonetheless, an advisory committee for the naming of roads and streets established in 1967, suggested modifications to existing public street names to foster a sense of national identity.15 Malay place names, for instance, were recommended, which explains the city’s jalans and lorongs.16
A year later, a committee to standardise street names in Chinese, and to provide English translations for Chinese and dialect place names, was set up.
Overtime, the authorities gave prominence to local culture and heritage, as well as leaders and public figures who were integral in influencing Singapore’s post-independence trajectory.
For instance, newfangled structures such as a $110 million bridge, which opened in 1981 as part of the East Coast Parkway, was named after Singapore’s second president Benjamin Sheares.17
Furthermore, Singapore’s pool of languages was tapped to reflect the city’s multicultural makeup. Take the case of Jurong industrial estate: the area is home to Fan Yoong Road (prosperity, in Mandarin), Neythal Road (to weave as clothes, in Tamil), and Jalan Tukang (skilled craftsman, in Malay).
In 2003, the Street and Building Names Board was established.18 It vets and approves the naming and renaming of buildings, estates as well as streets proposed by building owners and developers. In 2010, the Urban Redevelopment Authority took over its secretariat role.
The Street and Building Names Board encourages the retention of heritage in naming sites to “reinforce a greater sense of history and identity among the community”. The 2009 decision to name a street leading to the School of the Arts in Dhoby Ghaut as Zubir Said Drive, after the composer of Singapore national anthem, reflects just this. The board also prioritises names which can help emergency services locate places fast.19
Old street names, remarkable stories
Lavender Street
A view of Lavender Street in the late 19th to early 20th century. This street reeked due to the liberal use of night soil as fertiliser by the owners of vegetable gardens in the area.20 The name Lavender was picked for the site in 1858 as an ironic nod to the pungent odours it had come to be known for.21 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
High Street
This is likely the oldest street in Singapore. It was developed after Sir Stamford Raffles’ landing in 1819 and named as such due to its topography.22 It also once served as a high-end shopping stretch.23 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Beach Road
Once a coastal stretch, Beach Road appears in G. D. Coleman's 1836 map of Singapore. It was originally set aside for European merchants.24 (c. Late 1970s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Coleman Street
Coleman Street was named after Singapore’s first pioneer colonial architect who shaped early Singapore’s look. G. D. Coleman designed the Old Parliament House (The Arts House today) and the Armenian Church, among other landmark buildings. He was also responsible for the first topographical survey of the island. His house once stood along No 3. Coleman Street. It was demolished in 1965 and replaced by the present-day Peninsula Hotel.25 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Syed Alwi Road
Syed Alwi Road was originally called Syed Allie Road after the Arab merchant Syed Allie Bin Mohamed Al Junied. Syed Allie gave back to the community generously by donating land for community purposes and building large wells.26 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Pickering Street
Originally Macao Street and Upper Macao Street, and the site of the original Chinese Protectorate,27 this road in the downtown core of Singapore’s central region, was renamed to honour the contributions of William Alexander Pickering who, as the head of the Chinese Protectorate, helped clamp down on coolie abuse and rein in Chinese secret societies.28 He could speak Mandarin and four Chinese dialects, winning the hearts of members of the Chinese community.29 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
North Bridge Road
One of the earliest and longest roads in Singapore, North Bridge Road was named as such as it lies north to Elgin Bridge which spans the Singapore River. Its sister road, South Bridge, was part of Sir Stamford Raffles’ 1822 Town Plan. Both were built by convicts.30 (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Mosque Street
Mosque Street, a one-way street in Chinatown, was named as such due to the presence of Jamae Mosque which was built between 1830 and 1835 by Chulia Muslims. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-lien-wen-sze/story,"Whenever Dr Lien Wen Sze goes to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), she is armed with a mind full of knowledge, and her friends and family in tow. The volunteer Mandarin Guide is on a mission to get more people to visit Singapore’s museums, beginning from the one she has been conducting tours in for the last two years.
“I find this museum so wonderful,” says the 69-year-old retiree about the ACM. “I come here once a week with different groups of friends. I take them around, and invite them for tea, of course!”
Wen Sze’s love affair with ACM began after retiring as a food scientist at multinational food-and-beverage corporation Nestle. Not contented with just reading for pleasure, the bibliophile signed up to be a museum docent after chancing upon an open call for volunteers.
“Being a Singaporean, I feel the need to be more aware of our surrounding countries,” she says. “Coming to the Asian Civilisations Museum gives me opportunities to learn with a focus, and a chance to share my knowledge.”
Wen Sze was familiar with Chinese history. After all, she grew up the daughter of Chinese literary pioneer and Nanyang Siang Pau editor-in-chief, Lien Shih Sheng. In contrast, she knew very little about the histories and cultures of the rest of Asia until she started volunteering. From giving regular Mandarin tours of the ACM’s permanent collection as well as past special exhibitions, such as Cities & Kings: Ancient Treasures from Myanmar and Christianity in Asia: Sacred Art and Visual Splendour, Wen Sze has come to understand the commonalities that bind this region. A recent discovery she made is how many capitals of Southeast Asia—Bangkok, Singapore, Jakarta, and Yangon—are located near the sea as this allowed their inhabitants to trade with others easily.
Meticulous preparation
Every new exhibition at ACM gives Wen Sze the perfect excuse to buy books. This kickstarted a meticulous process of highlighting and footnoting, her method of identifying the building blocks for her historical tours. Wen Sze views history as a backdrop to our present. She believes the historical backdrop will help museum visitors understand the exhibited artefacts. For instance, visitors to the Joseon Korea: Court Treasures and City Life exhibition may be puzzled about why many of these artefacts from Korea are filled with Chinese characters. She explains to them that this is because the kingdom encouraged the spread of Chinese Confucian ideals and doctrines.
“If I just learn the artefacts without knowing the history, I’m not a good docent,” she says. “Anybody can just read the panel texts; I feel I need to fill in and make the connections.”
Such an analytical take on heritage stems from Wen Sze having a PhD in Chemistry and a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration. Working as a food scientist has also taught her to research in a methodical manner, and to be aware of histories and different cultures. Wen Sze has also contributed to food science education and training, having taught in universities in both Singapore and China. “Even when you develop a food product for a nation, you have to understand its culture,” she explains.
Despite having switched her devotion in life from science to heritage, Wen Sze says it has not only been easy but also a good change in lifestyle pace. Unlike the rapid changes in science and technology that required her to keep up with the latest developments, she enjoys how heritage moves slower as it is a “precipitation of culture”. She adds with a laugh, “It won’t go away. You can just add on and add on, so it is more rewarding especially for older people as we can’t run that fast now.”
In fact, this was hardly the case when I went on a tour led by Wen Sze. The bespectacled lady with a short crop of hair zipped through the exhibition of over 150 artefacts from South Korea’s national museums, hardly breaking a sweat. Even though she is a Mandarin Guide, Wen Sze also gamely added English translations when some of her visitors asked for it. And, after walking and speaking for more than an hour, she was still ever ready to answer questions from visitors.
Beyond the fascinating artefacts in the museum, it is clear that Wen Sze is also energised by the interactions with visitors on her tours. One of her most memorable experiences was taking the Literature Nobel laureate Mo Yan on a private tour of ACM when he was in town. Despite it not being his first time, the Chinese novelist praised her for proving to him how good the museum’s collection was.
“We have many good museums, and there are so many treasures in them,” says Wen Sze. “That is why we must do our part to let visiting museums become a national pastime!”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-ma-swan-hoo/story,"Dr Ma Swan Hoo is determined to make Singapore’s past a beacon for the future. She is paving the way by leading tours at several museums every weekend, often on both Saturday and Sunday. That is not all. Swan Hoo is a docent leader and mentor to fellow volunteers. She is also often sought after for her insights on making Singapore’s heritage relevant to the national interest. She does all this while holding a day job as a medical doctor, currently involved in research on cosmetics.
Becoming a docent
Swan Hoo’s decision to become a docent stemmed from a love for history. “I married a man who was very much interested in history and whenever we travelled, we would spend a lot of time visiting museums,” recalled Swan Hoo. These museum visits with her husband, Dr Balaji Sadasivan, helped her to appreciate the role played by good docents.
“Reading the captions and panel texts alone can be very tedious and one might be exhausted before getting a good grasp of the exhibition. A guided tour helps one focus on what is interesting, and what the narrative of the exhibition is,” observed Swan Hoo.
Thus, in 2001, she completed docent training at the Singapore History Museum (now called the National Museum of Singapore). Since then, she has guided visitors at The Peranakan Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, National Museum of Singapore, Indian Heritage Centre, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, Singapore Art Museum, and the National Gallery Singapore. She keeps herself up to speed by attending the latest training sessions at these institutions.
Shaping societal values
Swan Hoo believes that understanding the past helps to shape society’s attitudes in the present and future. For example, knowing that early Singapore was built on the backs of immigrants goes some way in persuading Singaporeans to be open to present-day immigrants. She also points to the communal tension and racial riots in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s as events that remind us of the value of the peace and stability we have in today’s Singapore.
“Although we’ve had a relatively short history, we did face a lot of challenges, and, fortunately, we had very capable leaders who were able to bring us out of these difficult times to where we are today,” says Swan Hoo. “It is important that we continue to progress and achieve the sort of society we are in now. I really feel we shouldn’t take things for granted.”
Swan Hoo’s compassion for people has led to deeds that go beyond typical museum volunteerism. For instance, she has bought the artworks of prison inmates and donated them back to their families. She has travelled with the Singapore International Foundation to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, to teach English at eight secondary schools there.
Leading museum volunteers
In 2004, Swan Hoo helped to set up Museum Volunteers (MV), a group consisting of working professionals who guide visitors during weekends and public holidays. She was its President from 2011 to 2014.
During this period, she worked closely with the volunteers to achieve the nearly impossible task of keeping the no-show of docents close to zero. What helped? Swan Hoo introduced an electronic scheduling system which let docents select their guiding slots and be responsible for finding their own replacement if they were unable to turn up. Having set up the system, she and her committee went a step further to mobilise, persuade and teach fellow docents to use the system.
“We don’t want our reputation as a museum or as a country to be tarnished just because the docent didn’t show up,” says Swan Hoo. “As far as visitors are concerned, they would not know that there is a last-minute cancellation of the tour, and they may have planned their day’s programmes around attending the tour. Imagine how the front-desk will be in a fix having to handle angry visitors. So, we must turn up.”
Sharing her vision
Swan Hoo has many ideas that would make museums a bigger part of people’s lives. For instance, she would love to involve more senior citizens in guiding museum tours for community groups. Singapore’s aging population lends itself nicely to this. “Senior citizens,” she says, “might be able to relate to a lot of the events that happened in the past which younger guides might not be familiar with.”
She envisions them doing soapbox tours. “We can keep our senior citizens actively engaged. They will feel that they are contributing to Singapore, and it also gives them a good reason to get out of the house, travel to the museum, get to know people, and get to learn about history or art or artefacts,” Swan Hoo says.
Another dream of hers is that all schools have professionally-trained museum educators. She would also love to see museums become alternative classrooms. “I feel that our museums should be places where our students can learn; not just go once, but make repeat visits. There are so many things they can learn at the museums,” concludes Swan Hoo.
When opportunities arise, Swan Hoo willingly shares such ideas. The Indian Heritage Centre benefits immensely from Swan Hoo’s visionary outlook – she serves on its advisory board. She also regularly participates in dialogue sessions aimed at nation building, such as the Our Singapore Conversation and NHB’s Heritage Plan dialogues. She hopes her ideas for museums will come to fruition soon so that history will indeed be a beacon for our nation’s future.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-belinda-mock/story,"Visitors to a museum would expect to be taken into the depths of history. But, as Belinda Mock sees it, Singapore's past is very much breathing and alive.
At a tour of the Singapore History Gallery, the veteran docent does not shy from a personal script. Her father, like many first-generation Singaporeans, arrived by boat while escaping the Sino-Japanese war in China, Belinda shares.
That was why Japanese soldiers thought the local Chinese were anti-Japanese supporters during World War II in Singapore, she adds. They targeted Chinese males at Operation Sook Ching, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
“I want visitors to realise that I'm not just presenting something that I read or heard about. My ancestors were part of Singapore's history. I am the end product of their experiences,” she explained.
Belinda loves talking about the city-state's rise as a bustling metropolis. These are the final sections of the gallery, located at the National Museum of Singapore. “Many visitors are in awe of how Singapore is peaceful, multiracial, and successful even though it is a small country,” she said.
She gives credit to the government for being able to change public perceptions when needed. For instance, there were student riots when the British first introduced national service in the 1950s. So, Singapore leaders took time to broach the subject after the country became independent, Belinda said. They eventually made national service compulsory in 1967.
There were attractive incentives for starting a military career—enough to convince Belinda, then a fresh jobseeker, to sign up. She became an officer with the Republic of Singapore Air Force.
“Visitors will look at me and think: ‘Wow, you were an officer?’ In the old days, people thought that the army was not a respectable way to make a living. Now, Singaporeans have grown to respect the military forces.”
“It’s my personal way of explaining that Singapore is successful because people have opportunities to do anything that they set their minds to,” Belinda reflected.
A passion out of work
Today, Belinda does marketing for an IT company. She leads two tours every Saturday, at heritage institutions including the National Museum of Singapore, Former Ford Factory, Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, and Asian Civilisations Museum. Sunday is her family day.
This has been the arrangement since 2004, when she started training as a docent with Museum Volunteers. The group is made up of around 200 English-speaking guides. Most of the members are Singaporeans holding full-time jobs, who share a passion for heritage, culture and the arts.
“As a museum docent, you get to learn about artefacts from the experts, before doing your own research for tours. For blockbuster exhibitions, an overseas curator may even come to Singapore to take us around,” Belinda said.
At times, members organise trips to exhibitions’ countries of origin. Notably, blockbusters are a chance for docents to get to know each other better and work as a team. “After an hour of guiding, we would probably lose our voices and go for afternoon tea or a drink,” Belinda said. The group also holds a traditional “exhibition sending off” potluck.
In 2014, Belinda took a break from work. She spent a very busy year as the President of Museum Volunteers before returning to the workplace.
Preparation for any exhibition is a lengthy process. After doing research, Belinda comes up with a detailed tour paper with varying stops, depending on the age range of visitors.
“To keep dementia away, people always recommend playing mahjong. I'd say volunteer as a docent. Every few months, a fresh exhibition forces you to learn something new. It keeps your mind moving,” she shared.
Museum culture
The rise in museum visitorship is encouraging for docents, Belinda said. When she first started, there were occasions where her tours had no takers. Now, she typically addresses a group of between 10 and 20 people on a Saturday.
“As Singapore develops and aspires to become a first-world nation, culture plays a large part. It is cool to be seen visiting museums. People like watching musicals and plays,” Belinda said. “These activities have become part and parcel of life, more so than the previous generation. I am very fortunate to be able to witness this change.”
Belinda inspired two of her colleagues at work to join the Museum Volunteers, and they are now actively guiding at the National Museum of Singapore. Beyond guiding, Belinda goes the extra mile by lingering after tours to talk to visitors. Some tourists ask her for food recommendations. Others need her help with directions, or recommendations for attractions to visit.
Belinda's advice for heritage lovers? “Try being a docent, especially if you love to share your experiences with others,” she said. “At the end of the day, you can inspire people through the stories that you tell.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-tan-boon-piang/story,"“When you are fast becoming a part of history, you better know more about history,” says volunteer docent Tan Boon Piang with a laugh. Jokes aside, this is why the 61-year-old decided to become a history buff some two decades ago.
He attributes his earlier lack of interest in history to not being inspired enough as a student at Catholic High School in the early 1970s. Plus, he was taught Southeast Asian history in Mandarin, and that made studying for the examinations extra tough. “Imagine the Indian and Thai names translated into Chinese! Oh my, what a mouthful!” he exclaims.
When Boon Piang finally put his heart into studying history at the age of 40, he found out that few institutions would entertain a middle-aged man who just wanted to learn for the sake of learning. The exceptions were the Singapore Hainan Hwee Kuan, where he took a two-year course on China’s history, and the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM).
In 2006, while still working in the banking industry, Boon Piang answered the museum’s call for volunteers to guide a special exhibition, On the Nalanda Trail: Buddhism In India, China and Southeast Asia. This led him to be invited three years later to join the museum’s then newly-set up docent group. He could not have been happier to be given the opportunity to attend training courses by curators and academics. “Nowhere else would I get to study history for free!” Today, besides the ACM, the retiree also gives Mandarin tours at the Peranakan Museum, and the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.
As the museums hold special exhibitions periodically, the delightful talks and training sessions never end for Boon Piang. They also expose him to topics he had not anticipated enjoying as much as he did.
Pop culture links
Before ACM’s Joseon Korea: Court Treasures and City Life exhibition, he had no inkling of Korean history, nor did he give his wife’s favourite Korean dramas a chance. But he ended up looking at these to find connections between history and pop culture when he had to do research for the exhibition. For example, he found a book about the popular Korean television series Jewel in the Palace, which was based on the Joseon Dynasty.
On his tours, Boon Piang brought along a Korean banknote and eagerly pointed out to visitors that the same king featured in the museum’s exhibition also appears on the banknote. This certainly worked with his wife who turned up for one of his exhibition tours.
“You can’t go on and on about the artefacts,” he explains. “You have to tell them that ‘this was used by that character in the drama’ to attract their attention.”
Supportive family
Both his son and wife have been supportive of his interest, but it has usually only been in the form of moral support.
Their daughter, on the other hand, has been to all of Boon Piang’s rehearsals. It was early on during such prep sessions that she pointed out his distracting mannerisms. For instance, she pointed out that she counted him saying “okay” 150 times in a single tour. She also advised him to condense the information he shared during a tour. “We are very close, so she dares to be brutally honest with me,” he says. Thanks to his volunteering, the father and daughter have had many opportunities to bond at the museum.
But, now that she has grown up, the 26-year-old is not interested in tagging along for overseas trips with her dad. For instance, inspired by the Joseon exhibition, Boon Piang planned a trip to Korea. “My daughter said, ‘I don’t want to go Korea with old people! Korea… must go with young people!’” He is still amused by her audacity.
Fortunately, Boon Piang has made some very good friends with the other museum volunteers. They often travel together, inspired by the exhibitions they work on. They have even initiated a project to translate ACM’s permanent exhibitions into Mandarin guide books. They have completed their third book, an effort which they laboured over for about six months.
Boon Piang recalls when an ex-colleague bumped into him at the museum and was curious why he would do tours for free. “Many people in Singapore wouldn’t understand,” he says. The answer for Boon Piang is simple: his newfound love for history, and the camaraderie he has forged with other like-minded volunteers.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-patricia-welch/story,"Once a teacher, always a teacher—the phrase resonates with Patricia Welch. Formerly a lecturer of Chinese history and religion at Boston University, she had left the job for a series of marketing roles.
Decades later and miles across the world, Patricia has found a way back to the profession. Now, she spends most of her time voluntarily training docents, who lead tours at nine museums and cultural institutions around Singapore.
“Although I left academia to work in the private sector, I always knew I wanted to return to that field. I believe in community service, but felt it was also important to use the skills and knowledge that I had acquired in the field of Asian art,” Patricia said.
“Being a volunteer docent—and given my education and experience, a trainer of docents—is, for me, the perfect combination,” she added.
Born in Wisconsin and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Patricia was aged 18 and a pre-medical student when she discovered a love for Asian history. “I have no idea what it was. Something just hit me right away, and I fell in love,” she said.
Patricia switched majors to Asian Studies at Boston University, where she also attained her Master’s Degree before continuing Chinese Studies at the University of Oslo, Norway.
In the late 1980s, she relocated to Bangkok, and signed up as a volunteer guide at its National Museum. When Patricia moved to Singapore in 1994, she was on the lookout for similar opportunities.
That was when she discovered Friends of the Museums (FOM), a non-profit organisation with nearly 2,000 members. The organisation provides financial support and weekday guiding services to museums and cultural institutions.
“Although I was working full-time, Friends offered free Monday Morning lectures and a large array of other activities, including study groups and tours, so I joined,” she said.
From docent to trainer
She has not looked back. Besides joining FOM, Patricia also became a member of the Museum Volunteers, a community of English-speaking guides who give tours on the weekends. Now that she is retired from full-time employment, she guides for both FOM and the Museum Volunteers.
“More than half of my friends in Singapore are fellow volunteers because that’s where we met! Volunteering is a great way to meet like-minded people,” Patricia shared.
Most docents giving tours on weekdays are expatriates like Patricia. “So, don't be surprised if you visit, say the Indian Heritage Centre, and find your guide a German or Brazilian,” she said.
Guiding at the Asian Civilisations Museum is among her favourite experiences. Visitors are given a glimpse of Singapore as an “ancient emporia” for the trading of goods. For instance, ivory from Africa passed through the city-state before being carved by the Chinese, Patricia explained.
“There are many stories that should be shared. Guiding is a pure joy, to be able to share knowledge and light that spark of interest in visitors,” she said. “It's a wonderful feeling when they come back and ask, ‘Where should I go next?’”
In 2015, she became involved in the training of FOM docents at institutions such as the Asian Civilisations Museum, Peranakan Museum, and Singapore Art Museum. Patricia also served on the FOM Council and was FOM’s webmaster for three years.
In 2016, Patricia was appointed Co-head of Overall Docent Training. She spends most of her time structuring and coordinating preparatory programmes which can be completed in 8 to 24 weeks.
“When we review applicants, we look for people who like being with people, who are keen to learn and make learning fun. We assume no prior knowledge whatsoever, which is why we have a large number of non-Singaporeans who also volunteer for our programmes,” Patricia said.
“Don't hesitate. As long as you have intellectual curiosity, being a volunteer docent or guide is very fulfilling.”
On top of guiding and training docents, Patricia also leads study tours to China for FOM.
Inspiring others
Volunteering is a family affair in the Welch household. Patricia's husband volunteers in his areas of expertise, primarily sitting on academic advisories.
Both her daughters have careers in the field of social work. One is a psychologist working primarily with young people. The second works with paperless refugees in Europe. They are also active volunteers in their free time, working with displaced and special-needs individuals, Patricia shared.
The small moments of guiding are close to her heart. Once, Patricia had a seven-year-old visitor on a tour around the Asian Civilisations Museum.
“I chose to speak to the girl, rather than leave her out. I told her that being interested in history requires some detective work. By looking at a statue, you can figure out what people wore, did and thought about life,” she said.
“I was using the words 'archaeology' and 'archaeologist' a lot,” Patricia added. “At the end of the tour, she told her mother that she wanted to become an archaeologist. It's a moment that I'll always remember.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-may-hui/story,"May Hui’s life is driven by a simple principle – to make life better for others. She does this through volunteer work that benefits a range of Singaporeans, from children and senior citizens to people with disabilities and prison inmates. Nowadays, most of her time goes into volunteering with the Singapore After-Care Association (SACA)—where she mentors prison inmates who are about to be released, so that they can re-integrate into society—and, as a docent with heritage institutions such as the Indian Heritage Centre, and the Malay Heritage Centre.
On the face of it, being a prison volunteer does not seem to have anything in common with being a museum guide, but May sees it differently. To her, both have to do with unlocking the prisons of the mind.
Whether it is inmates wanting to lead meaningful lives as free citizens or the man-on-the-street entering a museum to settle a doubt he has about a historical event, the common thread is the need to free the mind from the shackles of bias and misinformation.
“We just keep in our shells. We don’t know things until somebody unlocks them, and you go exploring on your own,” says May.
Inspiring stories
May takes pains to ensure that visitors get the most out of a museum trip. “There are so many things people can do in an hour. But, if they choose to step into a museum, it is my responsibility to offer them a memorable experience. So, I think accuracy of fact, being very comprehensive, engaging them, and bringing artefacts to life are important,” she says.
Having served over a decade as a prison volunteer, May decided to add being a museum guide to her list of volunteer activities. She wanted to balance the sad stories she hears from inmates with stories of hope from Singapore’s history.
Conversations with prison inmates tend to revolve around questions about their personal history including what made them commit a crime and so on, says May. Being a docent, she feels, would put her in touch with the inspiring stories of Singapore’s forefathers who “came here with nothing and worked very hard”. It would also give her a wellspring of anecdotes to use when encouraging others, be they in prison cells or outside seeking a sense of their roots.
So, when May learnt that docents were being recruited for the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall (SYSNMH), she was thrilled. She enrolled in the docent-training programme run by the Friends of the Museum (FOM). “I thought, well, this is a great chance to get to know the works of this great man, and what better way than to attend a training programme.”
In her own words
The aspects May likes about being a docent are that it enables her to internalise historical information, and share it with museum visitors in her own words. “Although a picture paints a thousand words, it is the docent who brings depth to life,” says May.
Using as an example the bust of Zubir Said on display at the Malay Heritage Centre, May explains that a docent can depict his journey in life by piecing together biographical details of the historical figure.
May points out that without someone fleshing out the details of Zubir’s life—how he left Indonesia for Singapore without his father’s permission so that he could fulfil his dream of becoming a musician, how from a self-taught musician he became a composer with Cathay-Keris Studio, and how he declined payment for writing the music and lyrics of the national anthem Majulah Singapura  because the honour of doing it was sufficient reward for him—one would see the sculpture, but miss the man.
“So the ‘picture’ here is Zubir Said, but I want to tell my story of how he became a good composer, and how we have a street named after him —Zubir Said Drive — because he had the drive. It is not Zubir Said Road or Zubir Said Street,” quips May, exercising a little poetic license to inject a bit of fun into history.
Docents are essentially the character of a museum in human form. Aware of the gravity of her responsibility in being the “face” of the cultural institutions she guides at, May continuously updates the information she shares with the public. She has 20 files into which she slots newspaper clippings and other bits of information she comes across pertaining to the artefacts she speaks about during her tours.
“You must like to talk to people and that’s no problem with me,” says May, adding that her experience as a prison volunteer has sharpened her ability to connect with people. Whether they are corporate clients or children, “you must be able to go to their level”.
Beyond the museum
It is this talent for reaching out to people that puts a shine on May’s work as a docent. During one of her tours at the Malay Heritage Centre, May overheard a couple of the visitors saying they used to live at the Joo Chiat area in Singapore. After the tour, May told them that Zubir Said used to live there as well. After Zubir retired from Cathay-Keris Studio in 1964, he spent his time teaching music at his home in Joo Chiat Place.
“They were so excited and said, ‘I’m going back to look for it.’ The trip to the museum should not end here. They should be able to do something with the information they have been passed,” says May. “They should explore further, especially during school holidays when they bring their kids along. So, it’s a responsibility that I have passed to parents — to go and explore the neighbourhood with their children.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Ho-Kwen-Khee-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"“I asked my students –– if they had a time machine, where would they like to go?”
Ho Kwen Khee, a volunteer guide at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall (SYSNMH), is also a full-time Chinese tutor by profession.
“I was hoping some kids would choose to visit the past –– our history is so colourful and exciting. Sadly, all my students chose to travel to the future. Looks like I am the only one who wants to go back to the Qing dynasty!” laughs Kwen Khee.
Her love affair with history dates back to her childhood. Thinking back, she attributes this passion to her history teacher in secondary school.
“She’ll talk history for two straight periods without looking at the book. I remember thinking to myself, Wow, she knows everything by heart. It was really admirable and inspiring,” she recalls with a smile. Kwen Khee seems to have imbued her own storytelling with the same qualities.
Life-long history lessons
Kwen Khee’s relationship with SYSNMH began quite by chance, with an invitation to a friend’s tour six years ago. “I fell in love with the place,” she sighs fondly. “It is small and humble, but its stories are endless and fascinating.”
“I wish more Singaporeans knew their history. This particular history is not (yet) in our textbooks; people do not realise the importance of Dr Sun Yat Sen in our own Singapore story,” says Kwen Khee about the exhibits.
Indeed, many Singaporeans do not know of Dr Sun’s revolutionary ideas and crucial role in Singapore’s intellectual development. According to Kwen Khee, even tourists from Taiwan and China have been surprised by what they learned at SYSNMH.
“They are always very grateful to learn. In China especially, their story is told very differently back home,” Kwen Khee explains. “This part of history is missing in the Chinese narrative. Some Chinese tourists even told me –– gosh, we do not know our own history!”
A storyteller at heart
A gentle and unassuming individual, Kwen Khee says she is not like other docents. Shyly, she confides that she has had a lifelong fear of public speaking. This is why she teaches private tuition instead of in public schools, she adds. One-to-one sessions with students are not as daunting as facing a whole crowd.
Why sign up to be a docent, then, and have to speak to large tour groups all the time? “Sharing stories is very rewarding. I like to tell stories,” she explains.
Kwen Khee is driven by her passion to educate, and pass important knowledge on to others. Besides, being a docent has helped her to overcome her phobia, she adds. Today, public speaking is no longer as difficult for her as it used to be.
“I use my own success story to encourage others who are afraid of public speaking too,” Kwen Khee shares candidly. “I tell them, just try. It might just help you get over your fears.”
Teachers’ knowhow helps
At SYSNMH, there is no one primary or main demographic. Visitors range from primary school students to tourists from all over the world, or senior citizens from various Voluntary Welfare Organisations.
Being a teacher, Kwen Khee is able to sensitively codeswitch and pitch appropriately to her crowd. As her students range from primary school all the way to junior college, she is used to varying her use of language –– speaking more clearly and simply to the little ones, and allowing more complexity and nuance to the older ones.
Furthermore, teaching has made Ms Ho very good at reading her audience; she is very sensitive to their needs and reactions. “It’s all in the eyes,” she chuckles. “From their eyes you can tell who is confused, who is engaged, who is dreaming!”
All these crucial skills allow Kwen Khee to simplify or complicate her language and content wherever needed. This helps her to tailor her speech to many diverse groups of listeners, keeping them happy and interested throughout the tour.
Growing as a docent
Becoming a tour guide at SYSNMH was not easy for Kwen Khee. “We did our own independent research, and wrote our own 5,000-word script,” she says.
She has been attached exclusively to the museum since she began giving tours in 2013. Selfless and dedicated, Kwen Khee goes above and beyond her tour guide duties. She also assists the memorial hall in arranging and scheduling special tours, as well as manages larger crowds by organising them into smaller groups before tours begin. This way, Kwen Khee helps to ensure that everything runs without a hitch.
It is clear to see that Kwen Khee’s passion and dedication to sharing knowledge permeates her tours. Truly, SYSNMH visitors are all the better for it!

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-jo-wright/story,"Jo Wright can turn an ordinary stone into an object of wonder just by telling you a story about it. She is a docent at the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), where her favourite artefact is a bezoar stone. The dull grey mass about the size of a ping-pong ball does not look like much, until Jo starts talking about it.
You can get this information about bozoar stones online or from books. But, what Jo does is take points of history and weave them into a narrative based on fact and folklore. That way, her stories enthuse museum visitors enough to make them want to read up more by themselves.
“We retell stories in this museum. We do story-led tours where the artifact is the central part,” she says. “I call it joining the dots. We uncover all the interesting stories about different artefacts, and it’s by pulling it all together that you really get people to look closely.”
Loved stories from young
As a young girl growing up near Oxford in the United Kingdom, Jo would go to the library every week. “Myths and legends from around the world was my staple reading. I’d go home and read voraciously, and the next week I’d swap them for new books. I was addicted to stories from a very early age,” she says.
Jo earned a degree in mechanical engineering in the UK where she worked in the avionics sector for 20 years. She came to Singapore in 2005 after her husband got a job here. She found out about the Friends of the Museum (FOM), a non-profit organisation made up of volunteers who dedicate their time to being guides in Singapore’s museums and heritage institutions. FOM complements the efforts of the National Heritage Board in sharing knowledge about Asian history, culture, and art with the community. Jo joined FOM’s docent training programme because training to be a guide in museums was a good way to learn about the history and culture of Singapore and, more broadly, Asia. It also enabled her to apply her skills in training other people, which was part of her job in the avionics industry back in the UK.
“Volunteering just gives you an opportunity to try different things, and to find those hidden secrets within yourself that you had absolutely no idea were there. And, I think that’s quite magical,” says Jo. One of the things she discovered was how the curiosity that led her into engineering lent itself nicely to her role as a pedlar of cultural knowledge.
“Having an engineering background is fantastic training because I look at things and think, ‘How does that work? Why is it like that?’.” Visitors who join her tours benefit from her enquiring spirit. She has guided over 8,000 people in some 600 tours, which have included everybody from six-year-olds and teenagers to government ministers.
Engaging with the audience

She also trains other docents and her tip to them is: “Inhale the artefacts and find something that really resonates with you.” The power to be engaging has a lot to do with finding something in an audience to engage with. Jo has led tours in which teenagers who “stood there truculent, shuffling” in the beginning, ended up interested because she was able to take elements of an age-old object and connect them with things that appeal to teenagers today.
Once, she made a bunch of secondary school students curious about a Chinese tomb dug up 3,000 years ago, by telling them that their mobile phones had something in common with a coffin in it – plastic. The coat of lacquer on the coffin, which kept it brilliantly preserved, she told them, was actually a natural form of plastic derived from the sap of the Toxicodendron vernicifluum, known more commonly as the Chinese lacquer tree.
Another time, she guided tertiary students who were doing courses in designing video games. Their teachers had sent them to ACM to get ideas and they did not know where to start. She asked them to think of themselves as storytellers as a way to approach designing games; then she sparked off their imagination with a tour of mythical creatures.
“‘Oh, we get it!’ they said. I told them, ‘All you’re doing is continuing a tradition that has been around for thousands of years; it’s in a different format, it’s in a different material, but it’s still storytelling’,” Jo recounted.
Stories are very powerful. They are deep in our mass memory,” she adds. In urban cities like Singapore, where things change very fast, having an abiding sense of one’s heritage is important. Many people tell her that the place they grew up in, or the school they went to, no longer exists.
“It is easy to become rootless when that happens,” says Jo, underscoring the importance of museums like ACM in forging a sense of belonging. She has been a guide there for over eight years. “I feel much a part of the fabric of this building,” she says.
Sometimes, when the children she guides ask her about her work as a docent, she explains that she is a volunteer and, hence, does not earn a salary from being a guide. They say, “Wah! Why you do this?” In reply she tells them, “If I see you bringing back your mum and dad, then that would be a fantastic reward for me.”

Bezoar stones
Bezoars are solidified lumps of undigested hair or vegetable matter found in the gastrointestinal organs of humans and animals. Today, the presence of a bezoar in the human or animal gut would be considered a medical problem (Eng and Kay 776) (Barroso 193). This was not the case in ancient times. Bezoars, especially those from ruminants like goats, were considered antidotes to poison. This made them popular among royalty and the wealthy, who were wary of being poisoned by their enemies (Barroso 82). They were used as medicines in Persia as early as the 8th century and reached European shores around the 11th century (Barroso, 80; Eng and Kay, 776). As word about their medicinal and magical properties spread throughout medieval Europe, demand for them increased. By 1700, Jesuit monks in the Portuguese colony of Goa were producing artificial bezoars to make up for the short supply of real ones (Alden 543; National Heritage Board 31).

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-lionel-louis/story,"Since 2015, Lionel Louis has served as the President of Museum Volunteers, a group of 200 men and women who lead free tours of the museums on weekends. Folks are often surprised when they learn he is in charge of the group. After all, his boyish features and wide-eyed enthusiasm make him appear even younger than his 32 years.
But, do not mistake his youth for inexperience. He is a dedicated specialist in Singaporean history, constantly upgrading his knowledge about our shared heritage.
“A docent’s training spans between three to four months,” he explains. “There are mock tours to do and research papers to write. And, once you start guiding, the learning doesn’t stop. Guests tell you new information, and curators give you new angles to talk about. Your tour is always evolving and changing.”
He began guiding at the National Museum four years ago, telling visitors stories about its most prized exhibits, such as the Singapore Stone and the Revere Bell. One of his favourite items on display is John Turnbull Johnson’s 1851 oil painting of the Padang, titled The Esplanade at Scandal Point. He enjoys pointing out all the easily missed details on the canvas, such as the presence of Orang Laut and Arab traders, as well as the view of the Armenian Church,St Andrew’s Church and Government House (now known as the Arts House).
Beyond textbooks
He also takes great pleasure in revealing secrets of the past that were not taught in school. For instance, history textbooks often neglect to mention that Colonel William Farquhar had two wives: one in Scotland and another in Malacca. The punchline to this anecdote is that one of his descendants, via his Malaccan wife Nonio Clement, is the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Towards the end of his tour of the History Gallery, he begins sharing tales about independent Singapore. “There’s a lot of personal stories I can tell people,” he says. “Like, there’s the Stop at Two poster. I like to tell guests that we’re a young nation, and our policymakers may make mistakes. We’re still learning from them.”
His favourite bit of the tour, however, is the conclusion, when the guests give him a round of applause. “People say, ‘I never knew history could be so interesting.’ That’s when I know I’ve done a good job. I once started a tour, and an elderly man said, ‘You look too young to be a docent. Are you sure you’ll do a good job?’ And, after the tour, he said, ‘I’ll give you a ten out of ten.’”
Occasionally, Lionel has been involved in slightly more unusual tours. For instance, as part of the Singapore Heritage Festival 2016, he was trained by a theatre company to lead dramatised tours. He ended up playing three different roles: a 14th century villager, an early 20th century Chettiar and the Chettiar’s son who became a civil servant.  His fellow guides played roles like black and white amahs, rickshaw pullers and Japanese soldiers. “It was very draining, but also very fun,” he says.
Mind you, not all volunteers need to be such dynamic storytellers. He points out the many other roles one can play at the museums, such as welcoming visitors as a host, or ensuring that they keep to the rules in the exhibition space as a gallery sitter.
Planning ahead
As the President of Museum Volunteers, Lionel has many responsibilities besides guiding. Together with a committee of 14 other people, he ensures that the guides are properly scheduled, trains new volunteers, organises Learning Days and collects feedback for the museums.
He is also attempting to create better documentation and a structured long-term strategy for his group, so that they can remain relevant in these changing times. But, planning ahead can be difficult, since the museums themselves are constantly changing and seeking new directions.
He experienced one such change when the Indian Heritage Centre opened in 2015. In spite of being Indian himself, he soon realised he had a lot to learn as a volunteer. “I was born into a Catholic family, then I converted to Buddhism. I had no idea about all the Hindu gods and their different forms. Then, I learned about all the different religions in the Indian community, like Parsism and Jainism, and about the independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose, and Tamil Murasu founder G Sarangapany.”
Surprisingly, the artefact that moves him the most is not a religious statue or a war relic. It is a Tamil language typewriter, capable of printing the 200-plus combinations of characters used in the script. The object reminds him of his own Tamil lessons as a schoolboy in the 1990s. Back then, he did not think much of the fact that Tamil fonts were available on the computer. But, he now realises that this was only possible because people who loved the language invented new ways to bring it into the 20th and 21st centuries.
He is grateful not only to the museum but also to the people who donated the typewriter: the family of the late Tamil poet Viswanatha Ikkuvanam Iyer. Their generosity has enabled him to gain a new appreciation for his heritage.
“Museums play a very important role in society because they’re a visual documentation of people and stories,” he says. “It’s important to document your own stories, so that museums can share them with people.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-long-chin-peng/story,"When she was a young woman, Long Chin Peng had to quit her job as a Chinese teacher. Being a mother of four children, of whom two had special needs, meant she had to spend endless hours feeding them with special bottles, ferrying them to doctors, dentists and speech therapists, and worrying while they recovered from surgeries. She felt that there was absolutely no way she could balance that kind of stress with a full-time job.
Soon enough, her kids grew older and more independent. They began urging her to get out of the house and pick up new hobbies. She still remembers their encouraging words: “Mummy, you should go and do something you like.”
By coincidence, the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) had just begun a recruitment drive for volunteer Mandarin guides. She found out about it from an advertisement in the LianheZaobao, while she was eating dim sum with friends at Chinatown’s Yum Cha Restaurant. All three of them signed up, but only she was called back for an interview.
That was back in 2003. Today, the 49-year-old Chin Peng is one of the most active and respected volunteer guides among the Mandarin Docents. She leads tours not only at the ACM, but also at the National Museum of Singapore, the Peranakan Museum, the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, the Malay Heritage Centre, and the Indian Heritage Centre.
The Peranakan Museum is especially dear to her heart as her aunt is a Nyonya, and Chin Peng did her thesis at Peking University on Peranakan culture. As a member of the Museum Volunteers group at the Peranakan Museum, she guides visitors in Mandarin as well as in English.
On top of all this, Chin Peng also volunteers at institutions that are not operated by the National Heritage Board. These include the National Gallery, the Art Science Museum, the National Library, Nanyang Technological University’s Chinese Heritage Centre, the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations, the Kong Chow Wui Koon, the Istana, and the newly-opened Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre. In short, she has gone from being a full-time mother to a full-time museum volunteer.
Patriotic duty
What drives Chin Peng to do so much of this work? In part, it is a sense of patriotic duty. “I try and contribute back to society,” she says. “I love my country. I love my country’s history, so I want to carry it onwards.” Whatever exhibition she is in, whether it is about the Silk Road or Southeast Asian artists, she takes care to explain how it relates to Singapore’s multicultural identity.
However, she has also developed a special bond with the museum staff and volunteers. That makes her feel like they are part of her own family. “You walk into the museum and it’s like going back home. Sometimes, when we don’t have enough visitors, we just walk through and talk to the security staff. They take care of us very well.”
Over the years, she has learned to tailor her tours to different audiences. When she is with kids in the Peranakan Museum, she takes them to the play area near the wedding galleries, or points out where they can stamp their tickets. When she is with elderly visitors, she asks them about their own heritage and their memories of the past.
VIPs require special treatment. Because they are often on tight schedules, she often has to give them a 20-minute whirlwind tour of an exhibition’s star pieces. As she talks, she monitors their faces closely for signs of boredom, so she can lengthen or shorten her explanations accordingly.
The next generation
Recently, Chin Peng has also been training kids to be Mandarin guides themselves. She does twelve-hour workshops with students, teaching them to create tours of the Peranakan Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.
This is difficult for many of them, especially when they have limited vocabulary. When they are asked to write about the artefacts, their descriptions are often full of English words, and hanyu pinyin (Romanised Chinese). But, with a little coaching, Chin Peng builds up their confidence and soon has them speaking fluently in their mother tongue. A few weeks later, their fellow students arrive on a field trip, and the kids are able to present a complete tour of the galleries to their friends.
On occasion, Chin Peng has even had family members join her as volunteers. In 2012, her son Lukas had finished his polytechnic studies, and was waiting to enlist for National Service. He and his cousin decided to help her out with the many activities that the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall had planned for its anniversary. While she led VIPs through the galleries, they worked as receptionists and picked up guests at the airport. This gave them a new sense of appreciation for all the work that goes into sustaining our heritage.
These days, Chin Peng finds that she is often involved in recruitment drives for new volunteers—something she never dreamt she would be doing when she first signed up 14 years ago. She is impressed by the calibre of the new docents, who are often highly educated professionals. Notably, many of them are new immigrants from China, with excellent Mandarin skills.
However, what is most important to her is whether a volunteer is truly committed. “I will always ask them, ‘Do you have the passion? And, do you have the time?’ Because if you don’t, then it will be very hard,” she says. “You may have to make sacrifices. You have to really want this.”
Of course, Chin Peng’s own commitment has never been in question. After years of devoting herself to the health and welfare of her family, she is free to share her knowledge about history—an act which truly brings her joy.

Pointing to the 19th century church bells, Pok Cheng San tells visitors that Boston bell maker Paul Revere gifted these bells to his son-in-law and first American Consul to Singapore, Joseph Balestier. The Mandarin-speaking docent then adds, “It was just a work trip, but Balestier’s father-in-law bade him final farewell!”
The joke cracks up some 20 Chinese-speaking visitors to the National Museum of Singapore. In Mandarin, “gifting bells” is pronounced “song zhong”, which sounds similar to the Chinese words for “seeing someone off at his funeral”.
This is just one instance of how the 57-year-old brings to life the Singapore story during a two-hour long tour of Singapura: 700 years, an exhibition that retells the history of this city-state. One of 60 Mandarin Guides at the National Heritage Board (NHB), Cheng San gives regular tours at the National Museum of Singapore.
Cheng San’s love for history began as a student at River Valley Government Chinese Middle School (now River Valley High School). He fondly recalls how his history teacher used to retell the past with so much gusto. While he did well enough to pursue a degree in history, his parents saved what little education funds they had for Cheng San’s eldest brother instead. “People in their generation gave priority to the first male child,” he says with resignation.
Making connections
Cheng San ended up putting himself through a part-time diploma course in business administration. He now works as a human resource manager at a waste wood recycling company. But, on his own time, he continued reading history books as a hobby.
In 2012, when he heard NHB was recruiting docents, he immediately signed up to undergo the seven-month training on Singapore’s history. Today, Cheng San is scheduler and research coordinator for NHB’s Mandarin Docents.
In his opinion, good docents perform, rather than reel off facts about the exhibits. This is something he learnt from attending tours during his visits to museums in China. Their docents’ masterful retelling of history had him staying on till the end of the tour despite his tired legs. It also set a benchmark for his own tours.
“I made a promise to myself to become as good as they are,” he recalls. This is why he willingly spends months researching and building on the curator’s work for his tours, and even tailors his delivery to audiences. “It’s boring even for the musician if he performs the same piece every night,” he says.
More importantly, he helps audiences see connections, something he found hard to do when he used to read history books for fun. “I took in information in fragments, so I couldn’t see relationships between events when there were,” he recalls. Today, Cheng San sees not only historical connections between museum artefacts, but also has developed the confidence to find clues about the past. Stopping at the painting View of Singapore from Mount Wallich on his tour, he draws the visitors’ attention to details in the 19th century painting. Cheng San points out how Telok Ayer Market still stands today as Lau Pa Sat, and the sea it depicts has since been reclaimed to house today’s thriving business district.
As the people who join his Mandarin-speaking tours are often tourists from China, Cheng San makes it a point to highlight common histories between Singapore and China. One of them is opium. After the British colonial government established and profited from opium farming and trading in 19th century Singapore, he tells those on tour, many Chinese immigrants became addicted to the drug. His listeners nod their heads sympathetically, reminded of China’s Opium War and the resulting cession of Hong Kong.
Cheng San then ushers them to a section featuring prominent Chinese businessman Tan Kah Kee. He asks, “Who established the prestigious Xiamen University in Fujian?” A visitor in his 20s replies, “Chen Jiageng!”
Students in China, Cheng San knows, study about Tan Kah Kee, whose name in Mandarin is Chen Jiageng. But, the familiarity with Tan Kah Kee is an exception, adds Cheng San.
On his tours, he has encountered many tourists who are misinformed about Singapore, often through inaccurate facts they encounter online. This is another reason why he readily volunteers his weekends to give tours, offering more than the 12 sessions a year he needs to fulfil as an NHB docent. Beyond the joy of entertaining museum visitors with stories about Singapore’s past, Cheng San says being a docent gives him the opportunity to carry out important work: guiding how visitors perceive this city-state, beginning with an accurate understanding of its past.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-akiko-kato/story,"In 2010, Akiko Kato arrived in Singapore. Her husband had found a job here, so the two had decided to leave Japan, starting a new life in this unfamiliar Southeast Asian city.
At first, life here was strange to them. In Tokyo, she had worked in a bank, then in a human-resources consulting firm. Now, without a career, she had to keep herself busy at home, looking after her children, and occasionally giving private language classes in Japanese.
However, three years later, while shopping at Liang Court, she glimpsed a poster that would change her life. It was an open call for volunteers to join the Japanese Docents, a division of Friends of the Museums. This was right up Akiko’s alley. “I like museums in general,” she says. “When I go to the United States or Europe, I always visit museums.” She had visited several Singapore museums as well, including the National Museum of Singapore (NMS), the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). She loved their cultural importance, and their cosy atmosphere—a welcome relief from the sweltering heat of this country.
After attending a public information meeting by the Japanese Docents, she decided to join them. The process was rather different from that of other volunteers. There was no interview or screening process. “If you want to be in, you’re in,” Akiko says. Speaking English was not a requirement either, as the entire training programme was conducted in Japanese.
Once she had completed the training programme, she began leading tours at the National Museum. Two months later, she started guiding at ACM. A year later, she added the Peranakan Museum (TPM) to her list. (Handling this many museums is not uncommon: all Japanese docents are expected to volunteer with at least two museums.)
Unique challenges
Akiko now holds the position of Japanese Coordinator on the Committee of the Japanese Docents. She serves as a liaison between the volunteers and the National Heritage Board, and the English-speaking members of Friends of the Museum. Together with the other nine members of the committee, she also coordinates schedules and updates their blog.
She is proud of the group’s history. Their roots go back to 1981, when two members of the Friends of the Museum decided to translate the English captions at the National Museum into Japanese. In 1982, they began Japanese tours at the museum twice a month, led by a group of nine docents. The number of volunteers, tours and museums steadily multiplied over the years, with experienced volunteers creating lectures and textbooks to train newcomers. As of June 2017, there were 73 Japanese Docents leading tours at four museums: NMS, ACM, SAM, and TPM almost every day.
The work comes with unique challenges. “Most of the docents are expats’ wives,” Akiko explains. “They stay in Singapore for three years on average, so not so many docents can continue their guiding for a long time. The longest a person has served right now is 11 years.”
Akiko has found guiding to be tremendously fulfilling. One of her favourite things to talk about is the legacy of Lee Kuan Yew. Despite the traumas he endured during the war, he faced the future, not the past, and built Singapore into a successful multiracial nation. “That is how the world should be,” she says. “If all the world had presidents and prime ministers like Lee Kuan Yew, maybe a peaceful world would come.” She reveals that many of the Japanese docents wept when he passed away in 2015.
Rewards of guiding
Guiding has also helped her to better understand Japanese culture. Back home, the only religions she had been exposed to were Buddhism and Shintoism. But, as a docent for the ACM, she had to learn about other faiths like Islam, Taoism, and Hinduism. She visited their houses of worship for the first time. Now, when she goes to temples in Japan, she can recognise the Hindu roots behind her own religious icons. It is just another example of how Asian cultures have interacted with each other for thousands of years.
She is looking forward to the opening of ACM’s Faith and Belief galleries, which will focus on the spread of religions throughout Asia. She is also eagerly anticipating several upcoming temporary exhibitions. “I need to study more and more. I never get bored!” she laughs.
Most of all, however, she enjoys the sense of community and belonging that she gets from volunteering. Through Japanese Docents, she has become closer to the Japanese community in Singapore, bonding with her fellow guides through meetings, lectures and outings to heritage destinations such as Kampong Glam and Kusu Island.
And, of course, she has also come to know Singapore better. Walking through the city, she recalls the history of this island through its street names and landmarks. Visiting restaurants, she is able to tell her children the stories behind each piece of kueh or dish of curry, giving them a better sense of local culture.
It is an experience that she thoroughly recommends to everyone who has the time and interest. “Come and join us,” she says. “The more you learn, the more you can enjoy life in Singapore.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-volunteers-clara-chan/story,"For decades, Clara Chan's headspace was a whirl of numbers. The investment banker wrote reports whenever a company put its shares on the market for the first time. She kept tabs on gains and losses.
Upon retirement, the 54-year-old decided to follow her heart. Her husband directed her to Friends of the Museums (FOM), which runs a docent training programme.
“He knew that I loved general history. When I travelled, I would always visit a country's main museum to hear stories about the place, people and culture,” she said.
After attending an FOM public information meeting, Clara began a six-month training stint. This included lectures by university professors, curators, and experienced docents, learning how to condense volumes of information into a one-hour tour paper, and presenting them to visitors in an engaging manner.
“The structured programme boosted my confidence. Mentors gave us tips on public speaking, which was a new experience for me,” Clara said.
In 2010, she gave her first tour at the National Museum of Singapore. Clara took a group around the Singapore History Gallery, through early Singapore, to life during the Japanese Occupation and the city-state's astounding development since.
“Being a Singaporean, it makes me proud to share our history with others. Plus, it's a good feeling when they thank you after a tour,” she said.
She picks up tidbits of information from visitors, too. Once, an elderly Singaporean shared an anecdote at the gallery's rickshaw exhibit.
“It was one of her saddest childhood memories. Her neighbour was a rickshaw driver. Every night, she used to watch him peel a layer of debris off the soles of his feet. It was a mixture of dust, dirt, and tar that clung onto his skin,” Clara said. “I will always remember that story. Now, I share it with other visitors, as it speaks volumes about the generation that has passed.”
Leading fellow docents
Clara was also part of FOM's training team. She co-led the National Museum of Singapore training in 2010 and in 2013, and co-developed the first training programme at the Malay Heritage Centre.
In 2013, she became the Centre's Coordinator. A year later, she took up the position of Joint Coordinator at the National Museum of Singapore. In 2015, Clara became FOM's President.
“As a docent, I didn't have many opportunities to interact with other volunteers. Now, I attend more meetings so I have gotten to know them better. Some have been guiding for 20 years, so I still have a lot to learn from the long-serving veterans,” she shared.
Despite additional commitments, Clara is still an active docent. She conducts tours, keeps up with research, and crafts fresh plans when exhibitions change. On most days, she has a packed schedule of meetings and guiding tasks. As a result, Clara makes it a point to spend evenings with her family. It is usually midnight when she starts to prepare for tours.
“Guiding was my first love. To me, the learning should not stop as President. It's just a matter of how I manage my time,” Clara said. “Volunteering involves self-sacrifice. I see it as my way of thanking society for giving me a new life. Before that, my life was focused on finance – it was not satisfying enough. Now, I lead a very fulfilling life.”
The future of heritage
During her term as President, Clara hopes to make guiding more inclusive. She wants to equip docents with skills to guide the disabled and those with special needs.
Although FOM has a strength of nearly 1,500, not many members are active volunteers, Clara said. Most FOM docents, who give tours on weekdays, are expatriates.
“There are many reservations about speaking to the public, but it's not that difficult. You just have to remember the key facts,” she said. “Volunteering results in a lot of personal growth. I would like to encourage more Singaporeans to come on board to volunteer.”
Clara has convinced at least one young Singaporean to volunteer, albeit in a different sector. Her eldest daughter, who is a journalist, has started volunteering with the non-profit organisation, HealthServe. She helps out with simple duties such as taking the blood pressure of migrant workers.
“In a way, I think my passion for heritage [volunteering] played a part. We are very close and she sees that I enjoy what I'm doing. So, she's pursuing something meaningful, too, aside from her work,” Clara said.
“I plan to keep up with guiding, as long as I can walk and remember my script,” she quipped.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/attack-of-the-swordfish/story,"This story first appeared in National Heritage Board's book, titled, 'Attack Of The Swordfish And Other Singapore Tales' by Charlotte Lim (Text) and Alicia Tan Yen Ping (Illustration). This book consists of six illustrated tales for early Primary school children that are based on Singapore legends or traditions.
“Father, look!” cried a young boy from the shore. His father, who was unravelling his fishing net, raised his anxious face to the blue sea that had suddenly turned silver. It was teeming with swordfish twisting and stabbing their way towards some fishermen’s boats out at sea.
The man dropped the net and ran to sound the village gong. By the time the Raja, Paduka Sri Maharaja, and his soldiers arrived to investigate, they were stunned by all the confusion and panic on the coast.
Men, women and children were screaming and weeping as the long blades of the swordfish shot out of the water and pierced right through the helpless fishermen, killing them all.
The swordfish then rocketed towards the villagers on the shore. “Run for your lives!” they screeched.
The Raja ordered his brave men to go down to the water. “Form a wall with your legs and fight the swordfish!” he commanded.
Unfortunately, even the Raja’s mighty army could not overcome the swordfish. Soon the gleaming sea turned to a bloody red as the swordfish slashed and sliced the men’s legs. When he saw his men groaning and writhing in pain, the Raja called for them to retreat.
The young boy who had first spotted the swordfish taunted, “Why do we make a wall with our legs? It will only hurt us. Why don’t we use banana tree trunks instead? That way, the swordfish will only hurt themselves!”
The Raja was secretly awed by the boy’s cleverness but his pride was wounded. Although he did not want to take the boy’s advice, he knew that it was the best solution. With much reluctance, he ordered the villages to fell as many banana trees as possible. When the tide was low, the people worked quickly to build a barricade along the seashore.
The soldiers and the people kept watch, armed with parangs and spears. The sluggish sea awoke again. It swelled and shimmered once more with what seemed like an even greater legion of swordfish. This time, the swordfish charged right into the trap and found their sharp bills stuck in the tree trunks!
The villagers leapt into the water and slaughtered the defenceless shoal of swordfish. The island celebrated the victory with a big feast and everyone sang a grateful toast to the boy who saved their lives.
Everyone except the Raja. Jealous and afraid that the people might think the boy more worthy of the throne, the Raja schemed to get rid of him. After the celebrations, he sent his men, cloaked in darkness, to the top of the hill where the boy lived.
There, they committed great evil by stabbing the boy until he died. But the blood of the boy did not remain on their hands alone. It spewed out from the wounds on his body and flooded the hill, turning it slowly into one bloody mound.
The mound later came to be known as Redhill or Bukit Merah. The name remains to this day in modern Singapore as an extraordinary memorial to the boy who was said to have saved his village a long time ago.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 - June 2017
Little India is a precinct that is not quite like any other in Singapore. Together with Chinatown and Kampong Glam, it is part of the popular trio of cultural precincts on the tourist circuit. It is also an important place for the local Indian community who visit it to eat, shop, socialise and pray.
Today, it has come to be known as the Indian precinct, but this was not always the case. In fact, Little India was not designated by Sir Stamford Raffles as an area for the Indian community in the Raffles Town Plan. Before Little India got its current name in the 1980s, it was just known as Serangoon, after one of the earliest roads in Singapore. This road was indicated on an 1828 map as the “road leading across the island”.
An Important Thoroughfare: 1819 to 1860
Serangoon Road got its name from the Malay word saranggong. It is likely that this derived either from a marsh bird called ranggong or the term serang dengan gong, which means to beat a gong. It began as an important artery of commerce and transport for the plantations in the interior of the island along the route to Serangoon Harbour. This northern harbour was never a major port of call for Singapore’s entrepôt trade. However, it was a vital loading and unloading point for the Johor gambier and pepper planters. These goods would then be transported to town by bullock carts.

The road remained a buffalo-trodden dirt track for many decades. In the 19th century, the opportunities available in Serangoon drew various communities there. Possibly, the most important factor for this was the presence of waterways. The Kallang and Rochor rivers facilitated habitation, transportation and commerce.
For these reasons, many kampongs (Malay for “villages”) were established around the Serangoon area. The Chinese community congregated around the present-day Syed Alwi Road and Balestier Road areas, and were largely involved in farming and plantation activities. The Javanese lived at Kampong Java, while the Baweanese established themselves at Kampong Kapor, many of whom worked at the nearby racecourse.

Kampong Kapor also attracted Indian Muslims, who worked mainly as port labourers and peons (low-ranking office workers).

Serangoon Road proper was laid by convicts who had been brought to Singapore by the British for their labour and were held at a prison at Bras Basah Road. Many of them settled nearby after serving their sentences.

Other Indians also gathered in that area to practice supporting trades. This was the genesis of an Indian district, which later extended down Selegie Road and into Serangoon Road.
Indians called the Serangoon area Soonambu Kambam, meaning “Village of Lime” in Tamil. In the past, lime was an important ingredient of Madras Chunam. This was a kind of cement or plaster brick that was introduced from India and used in construction work. By the 1820s, the British set up lime pits and brick kilns along Serangoon Road, where many Indians found employment. 
An Era of Cows and Buffaloes: 1860 to 1930
The brick kilns were discontinued in 1860. After this, the development of the Serangoon area centred on cattle, which transported produce to town for sale. This area was ideal for cattle because of the abundant water from ponds, mangrove swamps and Rochor River. These provided bathing areas for water buffaloes, which were the workhorses of Singapore at that time and were used for all heavy tasks, from transporting goods to rolling roads.
Many cattle-related industries were established in and around Kandang Kerbau (Malay for “buffalo enclosure”). This village was located to the west of Serangoon Road and later became known as Kampong Kerbau. Such industries included slaughterhouses, tanneries and milk peddling.

The presence of the cattle industry attracted even more Indian settlers such as North Indian herdsmen from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the early 1900s who settled by Rochor Canal. Until the 1930s, one could also find Bengali and Tamil milkmen around Buffalo Road and Chander Road. They travelled with their goats and cows, bringing fresh milk right to customers’ doorsteps. Another common sight was Indian women travelling from house to house, selling fresh homemade thairu (Tamil for “yoghurt”).

The old Tekka Market was built in 1915 at the junction of Serangoon and Bukit Timah roads as one of the first centralised sites for selling cattle produce. An important reason for building this market was so that the retail activities did not clutter up the verandas and roadways along Serangoon Road.
S. Rasoo, a former watchman at Tekka Market, remembers it as a “lively, bustling place with Indian women coming up in their colourful saris, their hair done up in buns or single plaits decorated with fragrant flowers, jostling against the pig-tailed houseboys that served the Europeans and wealthy Asians. The noise was deafening, the atmosphere reverberating with the sound of raised voices bargaining over fresh fish, meats, vegetable and fruits”.

Multicultural Centre of Business and Trade: 1860 to 1970s
Wheat-grinding sheds, sesame oil presses, rattan works, rubber smokehouses and pineapple factories emerged alongside the cattle industry. Although these industries may seem unconnected, they had a symbiotic relationship centred on the wet environment with buffaloes providing the labour. Their waste products were often used as cattle feed.
One such example was taukeh (Malayan term referring to a Chinese businessman of good standing) Tan Teng Niah’s sweet factory at Kerbau Road which used sugarcane to manufacture candies. It is likely that the bungalow which can still be seen today was part of this factory.

Sugarcane was transported to Tan’s factory by bullock carts, and after the juices were extracted, the leftover fibres were reused as fuel or cattle feed. 
There was a significant Chinese and Malay presence in the Serangoon area at the beginning. However, various factors helped to eventually establish a larger Indian enclave here. For instance, many Indian migrants were employed by the municipality in the early 20th century. From the 1920s, the colonial government started constructing terrace houses in Serangoon to accommodate them. These were known as Municipal Quarters or Coolie Lines. Some of these quarters can still be found in their original form along Hindoo Road in Little India.
Shops and amenities catering to this growing Indian population flourished. There were garland makers, astrologers, goldsmiths, moneylenders, tailors, restaurateurs and shop owners selling luggage, saris, spices and other provisions from India.

The Turmoil Brought by World War II: 1941 to 1945
When the Second World War began, Serangoon Road became one of the targets for Japanese bombers. Kannusamy s/o Pakirisamy (b. 1914) used to live at Buffalo Road as a child. Speaking to the National Archives of Singapore, he recalled: “... some houses were damaged by bombs in front of Hindoo Road and... [in] Farrer Park, some people went and put camps. [...] The Japanese bombs [would] be coming three, six, nine, in V-shape. [...] Houses were all damaged.” 
Many people turned to places of worship for refuge at this uncertain time. The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple was one such place where hundreds took shelter. It survived unscathed through the bombing and this was attributed to the power of the deities by its devotees.

However, other sanctuaries were not as fortunate and one side of Foochow Methodist Church was destroyed. Another casualty was Kandang Kerbau (KK) Hospital, where a big red cross was displayed so that it would not be bombed.

Unfortunately, one morning the British began moving their lorries and guns into the compound and the hospital was bombed within half an hour.
At this time, Singapore’s second president, Dr Benjamin Sheares (1907 to 1981), was Deputy Medical Superintendent at KK Hospital. As there was only one other doctor at the hospital, both men stayed there and worked in shifts. Midwives were also kept very busy as there were only three nurses to look after around 200 babies.
When the smoke cleared in February 1942, Singapore had become Syonan-To. It is believed that the conquering “Tiger of Malaya”, General Yamashita himself, passed through Serangoon Road. During the first weeks of the Japanese Occupation, New World Park in Serangoon was one of the 28 sites used as a mass-screening centre for the Dai Kensho (Japanese for “great inspection”) operation to remove anti-Japanese elements within the Chinese population of Singapore, later known as the Sook Ching (Mandarin for “cleansing through purging”) massacre.
The Urbanisation of Serangoon Road: 1945 to 1980s
Even after the war ended in 1945, its effects on Little India’s socio-economic landscape remained. Many shop owners had sold their businesses to their hired hands before they fled the island. Those who survived moved up the social ladder in the post-war era.
P. Govindasamy Pillai, affectionately known as PGP, had five sari shops in Serangoon before World War II. He left for India in 1941, handing his business to a relative. He returned after the war to continue his business. While new businessmen were just setting up in the 1960s, PGP was already moving ahead and renovating his existing stores. He was also known for his generosity in using his wealth for philanthropic purposes and supporting community institutions such as temples.

Once Singapore attained full independence in 1965, there was a drive to clean up and renew the city. Early efforts focused mainly on the town area and later expanded outwards to encompass Serangoon. At this time, many residents of this area were living in dark, cramped and unhygienic conditions. By the mid-1970s, concrete development plans had been introduced with the Housing & Development Board (HDB) setting aside a significant sum of S$4 million for Kampong Kapor’s renewal.
In 1980, it was decided that the old Tekka Market had to be relocated to a better facility nearby. The Zhujiao Centre (now Tekka Centre) was thus built across the road in 1981. It was planned as one of the early residential-cum- shopping complexes in Singapore and included a wet market, food centre and HDB homes.
Serangoon becomes Little India: 1980s to Present Day
Little India as we know it today was not officially named as such until the 1980s. This was the result of a concerted effort by the then Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) to promote the preservation and celebration of Singapore’s ethnic quarters.
Today, Little India is a district that offers something for everyone. While local Indians visit the temples here and shop for traditional goods, non-Indian locals and tourists also come to soak in the culture and history of this historical precinct. Launched in 2017, the Little India Heritage Trail reveals some of the stories and memories of this area, while offering three thematic routes for visitors to better understand this area.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2014
Travelling along the arboreal forested highways with graceful four-limbed locomotion is an enigmatic acrobat in a black coat of fur: The Banded Leaf Monkey.
Visitors to local parks and nature areas such as MacRitchie Reservoir and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve (BTNR) would be familiar with the sight of sizeable troops of monkeys foraging by the trails. Known as the Long-tailed Macaque (Macaca fascicularis), this opportunistic primate has managed to thrive despite widespread disturbance of its habitats, its omnivorous habits and tolerance of humans. A few regard the macaques as nuisances, but to others, their presence adds a rare touch of the wild and wonderful to life in the urban jungle, and many weekend warriors savour the opportunity to see this versatile survivor of Singapore’s natural heritage.
Not many people, however, are aware of another monkey that dwells in the deeper parts of our nature reserves. Unlike the long-tailed macaque, this creature seldom descends to the ground and would find human treats unpalatable and indeed, harmful, to its health. And though it was once found all over Singapore, it now survives only in small patches of forest in the heart of the island.
Shy and Scare Vegetarians
A study in black and white, the Banded Leaf Monkey (Presbytis femoralis) is a startlingly pretty animal with midnight fur and ivory bands traversing the underside of its body and limbs. A diversity in hairstyles is often observed; while the scruffy, unkempt look is the most popular, an upswept Mohawk hairdo is also not rare.

Unlike the long-tailed macaques, which happily snack on insects and bird’s eggs when given the chance, the banded leaf monkey advocates strict vegetarianism, consuming primarily fruits and immature leaves. However, typical Singaporeans that they are, they are extremely picky about their diet. Depending on the season and the availability of favoured fruits, the monkeys travel long distances in order to procure suitable food, which contrary to popular belief is not always abundant everywhere in the forest. Thus, their survival may hinge on the continued existence of sufficient and uninterrupted expanses of forest that would allow the monkeys to locate their preferred food sources. The constraints of living in land-scarce Singapore is as much a reality to them as anyone else; the leaf monkeys share their minuscule forest plots with Singapore’s two other native primates: the aforementioned long-tailed macaques and the rare Sunda Slow Loris (Nycticebus coucang), a wide-eyed, fluffy thing that comes out only at night to feed on fruit, nectar and insects.
Shy by nature, the banded leaf monkey is almost always the first to crash away into the depths of the jungle upon seeing a human. This comes as no surprise, given that these monkeys were frequently trapped as pets and poached for the cooking pot by people many decades ago. In those earlier, more innocent days, scenes of banded leaf monkeys leaping in an orderly line across the forests emitting calls that can be heard kilometres away were common throughout the island.
Up to the 1920s, banded leaf monkeys were still reported to be widespread in various areas including Bukit Timah, Changi, Pandan, Tampines, and Tuas, where industrial estates and shopping malls presently stand. Deforestation for urban development led to the relentless shrinking of their habitat, confining them to isolated woods in the BTNR and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR); a decline which, unfortunately, did not stop there. On October 1987, an elderly female believed to be the last banded leaf monkey in the BTNR was mauled to death by dogs as she climbed down a tree. She now rests in peace at the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR), a formalin-drenched reproach in charcoal and horn. With the subsequent construction of the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) right across the two reserves, habitat availability for wildlife dwindled as the remaining two green lungs of Singapore were disconnected, arresting biodiversity exchange and leaving the CCNR as the last refuge of the banded leaf monkeys in Singapore.
“We must do whatever we can, together with the rest of the world, to slow down the loss of biological diversity. Let’s try to do something to conserve the banded leaf monkeys because it is a very powerful symbol of what we are trying to do in Singapore to conserve the endangered species, both of plants and trees as well as mammals.”
- Professor Tommy Koh, Ambassador-at-Large, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chairman, National Heritage Board. Professor Koh was speaking as guest-of-honour at ‘An Evening Dedicated to Conserving Singapore’s Biodiversity,’ a seminar organised by the National University of Singapore on 16 April 2010.
Taking Stock of our Natural Heritage
Singapore’s incessant march towards greater development in the past century has also contributed to a severe decline in the diversity of her native wildlife species. Some are sadly believed to be beyond rescue, such as the Cream-coloured Giant Squirrel (Ratufa af nis). This cat-sized rodent was first described from Singapore in 1821, but only two individuals were last sighted by 1995. Previously described by Sir Stamford Raffles as being abundant in the forests, this species is probably already extinct in Singapore.
On a similar note, some 30% of the total native vascular plant flora (namely flowering plants, conifers and ferns) is presumed nationally extinct, with another 30% regarded as critically endangered in Singapore as of 2010. This deterioration in local species richness and abundance is a call for urgent action in research and measures to conserve the endangered species that still survive in Singapore, lest they go the way of the cream-coloured giant squirrel.
The banded leaf monkey was first described from our nation in 1838 and is considered Critically Endangered in Singapore. Based on fur colouration and other physical characteristics, some scientists believe that the banded leaf monkey may be a subspecies unique to Singapore, differing from populations in neighbouring Johor, Malaysia. As a key representative of our natural heritage, the banded leaf monkey deserves a high priority in conservation. However, the difficulty in tracking and observing these enigmatic primates has been a major factor deterring researchers from studying them. Little is known about their natural history and ecology, except that their population size was estimated at just 10 in the 1980s and approximately 20 in the 1990s.
Recent Discoveries Bring Hope
My strong interest and love for primates propelled me to carry out a Master’s research project on the banded leaf monkey in Singapore, 15 years after the only other study done on this elusive species. With generous funding from the Ah Meng Memorial Conservation Fund by Wildlife Reserves Singapore and logistical support from the National Parks Board, I spent nearly two years trudging through the tangled expanses of the forest.
But this effort has finally paid off. We estimate the present local population to consist of at least 40 banded leaf monkeys as of 2010, two times greater than previously believed. We have also provided the first report on their reproductive biology and infant development, and found encouraging signs that the population may be recovering. In addition, food plant species have been identified through feeding observations, the first preliminary analysis of their feeding ecology. This provides valuable information on the species of trees the monkeys require to adequately feed and thrive.

Furthermore, we have clarified the taxonomic debate on whether the Singapore population is the same subspecies as that in Johor through genetic studies of their faeces. Contrary to prior belief, the banded leaf monkeys in Singapore and Johor are likely to be the same subspecies, elevating hopes of possible translocation and reintroduction of the species in both localities in order to ensure their long-term survival. A comparative study on the different populations of the banded leaf monkeys is therefore essential towards a deeper understanding of their population ecology. With a research grant from the Jane Goodall Institute in Singapore, I will be continuing my research on the banded leaf monkeys, this time on those found in Malaysia.
Despite depressing news of various species going extinct over the years, some heartening rediscoveries in Singapore’s natural heritage do help to lift the spirit a little. For instance, during my research on the banded leaf monkey, we rediscovered several plant species previously thought to be locally extinct. And in 2008, Marcus Chua, a fellow student at the National University of Singapore, rediscovered the greater mousedeer (Tragulus napu) with signs of a breeding population in Pulau Ubin during his field research. These are the results of a continuous effort in scientific research into local biodiversity, and demonstrate the importance of regular studies and monitoring in order to provide timely updates on species abundance and distribution. Hope is not all lost!

The preservation of our natural heritage requires concerted efforts from each and every individual of the society. The findings of my research on banded leaf monkeys, which were possible thanks to the support of both the public and private sectors, are evidence of this. Contributions from and collaborations between researchers, educational institutions, government bodies and non-governmental organisations can enhance the quality of biodiversity research and increase the appreciation of our national treasures, many of which are uniquely Singapore’s. Strong public support and interest is also vital to conservation efforts, as citizens become aware and more appreciative of Singapore’s natural heritage and the need to strike a balance between urban development and maintaining the health and biodiversity of our remaining forests.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 – Jun 2017
Museums are human institutions which play an important role in the public enjoyment of history, heritage, art and even science. Many of the museums we are familiar with boast wonderful repositories of national collections and artefacts. Community museums and galleries, on the other hand, play the role of documenting and conveying history and heritage through the social memories of people, be it through interviews, old photos or personal collections.
Work @ TJ – The Industrious Pioneers of Jurong was the third in a series of community co-created thematic exhibitions at Our Museum @ Taman Jurong, which chronologically charted the development of Jurong and the evolving occupations of its residents. Stories were told through residents' memories, beginning from the pre-1960s when Jurong was considered a ""lost region"" due to the lack of people and development, to the present day in 2017 where Jurong is a major driver of the nation's industry and economy.
Pre-1960s – No Man&Rsquo;s Land
The Jurong of yesteryear would be completely unrecognisable today. A largely undeveloped area, farms, plantations, ponds, and mangroves could be found all around. Residents of early Jurong took on jobs as farmers and rubber tappers at the many gambier and rubber plantations found in this vast area in the 19th century. These plantations and farms, which were the main work sites in Jurong, played a major role in the area’s subsequent development.

A legacy of the early 20th century which still lives on till this day is the brickworks industry. Pottery kilns were located in Jurong due to the favourable soil found in the area. Up to 800,000 bricks could be produced each month in these kilns. One of the oldest surviving pottery kilns – the Thow Kwang Pottery Jungle, also commonly known as the Dragon Kiln, is still located in Jurong today.

1960S – Evolution
With the dawn of the 1960s, Jurong experienced huge changes that permanently altered its landscape. Singapore embarked on a massive industrialisation programme with Jurong as its core. Through this programme, Jurong was redeveloped with 1,600 hectares reserved for the Jurong Industrial Estate. The same land that once housed farms and plantations were redeveloped to make way for factories such as NatSteel, Jurong Shipyard, Jurong Wharf, Jurong Fishery Port and military camps such as Pasir Laba Camp.

As the Jurong workforce grew to meet the demands of the area’s development, so did its residential aspects.
Madam Sandy Lee recounts her mother’s story about opening the first hair salon in Jurong: “She said, ‘The government wrote a letter to us, asking us to open a salon in Taman Jurong... This place is so far and deserted. If not for the government’s letter, we wouldn’t have come to Taman Jurong!’”
Madam Sandy Lee's (pictured) mother operated one of the first hair salons in Taman Jurong – Xin Toh [新都] Hair Salon. Located at the ground floor of Block 1, Taman Jurong, the salon not only provided haircuts at an affordable price, but also warm towels, comic books, and shaving services for its patrons, 2016. Courtesy of National Heritage Board.
To encourage workers to stay in Jurong, then Finance Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee set up a toll gate which charged lorries and buses $50 a month for transporting workers into Jurong. As a result, companies began to set up living quarters for their workers within Jurong. Thus, as Jurong grew in its capacity for the nation’s economy, so did its population. Mr Quah Kim Poh, a long-time resident of Jurong, shares: “Jurong then was very inaccessible and many Singaporeans refused to reside in this area. It was due to industrialisation that made Jurong an international metropolis [sic].”
As some of the first residents to move into Taman Jurong, in the 1970s, Mr and Mrs Quah Kim Poh were witnesses to the many changes that took place as Jurong industrialised. Until today, their entire family continues to reside in Taman Jurong, demonstrating the strong ties that envelop this community, 2016. Courtesy of National Heritage Board.
1970S – From Strength to Strength
The 1970s is widely known as the prime decade for Jurong, with its tremendous growth and plentiful job opportunities. In 1970, Jurong Port hit the million-tonne mark for the amount of cargo handled in a year.

At the same time, many multinational companies from all over the world were coming to invest. By 1976, there were 650 factories operating in Jurong, and tens of thousands of workers being employed. Farms and plantations which were a major part of the 1960s had to make way for growing industrialisation. Residents here were employed in various fields of work.

Madam Halijah binte Sulaiman, for example, worked at the WMF Flatware Factory at 7 Gul Avenue, where her daily tasks included polishing high-quality cutleries to a shine before they were shipped for exports. The industrialisation programme proved to be a success as unemployment dropped to under 3% in the 1970s from 14% in 1964.
The military also expanded its capabilities with specialised training schools for different vocations being set up in the Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute (SAFTI), which was located in Jurong.

1980S – Present Day: Into The New World
In the 1980s, developments in Jurong shifted towards technology and knowledge-based industries. This change was reflected in Jurong’s landscape as heavy manufacturing companies began to move out, and chemical and technological industries, along with light manufacturing started to move in. Workers had to equip themselves with new skills to keep up with the changing demands of the job.
During this decade, Jurong also became key to another aspect of Singapore – waste management. The Tuas Incineration Plant heralded this new era with its completion in 1986. Subsequently, Tuas South Incineration Plant and Keppel Seghers Tuas Waste-to-Energy Plant were added in 2000 and 2009 respectively. Combined, they make up more than half of Singapore’s incineration capacity.
Looking to The Future
There is no doubt that Jurong will continue to play a significant part in driving Singapore's industry and economy. As it continues to evolve, one new addition is expected to add to its changing landscape from 2017 onwards; a second Central Business District. With a peak into the future, the workers and residents of Jurong can certainly be expected to continue transforming the landscape of Singapore.

Work @ TJ – The Industrious Pioneers of Jurong ran till end-July 2017 at the foyer of Taman Jurong Community Club. To provide an immersive multi-sensory experience, this exhibition featured unique scents specially developed and generously by Givaudan, the global leader in the creation of flavours and fragrances that 'engage your senses'. These scents included that of oil at a shipyard, brickworks at a pottery kiln, tyres in a car workshop, mangroves and even National Servicemen in training. While Givaudan generally works with food, beverage, consumer product, and fragrance partners, their passion for understanding consumers' preferences and their relentless drive to innovate enabled them to create these special scents, which undoubtedly left a lasting impression on visitors both young and old. Visitors were able to imagine what it was like to work and live in Jurong in the past or to reminisce about the good old days. For more information, visit Our Museum @ Taman Jurong's Facebook page.

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 1 - Jun 2017
The task of mapping the historical area of Kampong Gelam (often spelled as “Kampong Glam”) is a daunting one. One has to consider not only its labyrinth of former side streets and alleyways, but also the numerous paths and shortcuts traversed by the many that once worked and lived in the area. Although Kampong Gelam was gazetted as a conservation area in 1989, many of these routes and pathways had by then become a thing of the past. Various roads were expunged through the 1960s and 1970s, and business owners – including various printers and publishers – had already begun moving out or closing down their offices. To chart a trail through Kampong Gelam to better understand its history, it appears, is therefore always to be trailing behind its history, always a step too late to the scene of what was before.
Mereka Utusan: Imprinting Malay Modernity, 1920s–1960s was the Malay Heritage Centre's (MHC) fifth special exhibition, and it sought to recover the oft-forgotten history of the Malay language print and publishing industry in Singapore. In line with MHC's theme for 2017, Bahasa (Malay for ""language""), the exhibition considered not only the language of the Jawi script used by Malay publishers of the time, but also the visual language of advertisements, editorial cartoons and comic strips prevalent in the Malay publications. More importantly, it restored the importance of Kampong Gelam as a node within a regional network of Malay printers, publishers and readers. The district’s importance reached a peak in the period between the 1900s to the 1950s, when no less than six printers and publishers could be found in various spots around Kampong Gelam.
As part of the exhibition, a guided trail consisting of stops at the sites of former printing and publishing offices in Kampong Gelam was held in March 2017. Entitled Di-chetak Oleh (Malay for “printed by”), the title references the small print often written at the bottom of the back of Malay magazines to denote their printing companies’ names.
A cover of Fesyen magazine from 1959. The magazine was printed at HARMY Press which was located at 101 Jalan Sultan, 1959. Published by HARMY Press.
For example: Di-chetak oleh Al-Ahmadiah Press, Di-chetak oleh Qalam Press, and so on. For the team involved in the exhibition, the title also conjured memories of entire days spent close-reading and poring over hundreds of Jawi magazines kept in the MHC Collection, contributed by readers and former publishers.
101 Jalan Sultan, where HARMY Press and Al-Ahmadiah Press were based, c. 1950s. Published by Qalam Press.
In keeping with this spirit, the trail invited participants to contribute to the program by handling artefacts from this archive as well as those shared by our exhibition partners during the course of the trail. Participants then shared their reactions to these objects and artefacts, as if they too were helping to piece together this now-lost history of Kampong Gelam.
These objects and artefacts which the participants handled consisted of Jawi magazines from MHC’s education collection, and lead letterpress types that would have been used by Malay printers and publishers. A special treat for the participants was getting to experience a scent specially created by leading international fragrance company, Givaudan, whose perfumers were inspired by their trip to MHC’s Pustaka (the term “pustaka” encompasses language, literature and publishing) gallery. The intent behind these trail aids was to create a trail that was impressionistic rather than didactic, and was reminiscent of French writer Michel de Certeau’s musings of walking aimlessly in the city and being bombarded by “the chorus of idle footsteps”. For many who lived and worked in Kampong Gelam, these impressions were their guide to the area. Through speaking with Mr Abdul Aziz bin Abu Talib, a descendant of the owner of Royal Press (formerly located at 745 North Bridge Road), who was in his 60s, the curators discovered that his memories of navigating Kampong Gelam as a young printing apprentice to his father were filtered through such impressions as bicycling through the area, pulling eight-hour workdays in the printing office and wandering between the various side streets.
Photographs of the Royal Press Printing office at 745 North Bridge Road, c. 1946 to 1956. Published by Qalam Press.
Such impressions of navigating Kampong Gelam provide a contrast to town plans, surveys and maps of the area which have been done as far back as the 1820s. Rather than providing clarity to the orientation of the area, these mapping projects were intended to rationalise the area for the purpose of future development and planning. It is not coincidental that such mapping projects of Kampong Gelam often preceded redevelopment projects, in which streets such as North Bridge Road and Victoria Street were paved and other streets such as Palembang Road and Jeddah Street became expunged over time. The irony, then, of such clear-eyed mapping projects and route surveys is the ultimate alteration of these very spaces.
Rapid development in the Kampong Gelam area, particularly in 1960s to 2010s, has therefore created what de Certeau refers to as “blind spots” within our field of vision towards “space itself”. This includes the history of that particular space, the organic interactions that take place within it, as well as its activities – all of which would escape a detached overview of that space.
The printers and publishers of Kampong Gelam are just some of the many historical agents who have since slinked off into these so-called “blind spots”, particularly in the aftermath of a ban on printing factories within the area in the 1990s. Only traces of these printers and publishers remain in the physical landscape of Kampong Gelam today, barely discernible amidst the rows of textile shops, dimly lit massage parlours, watering holes and bustling family eateries. With the exception of a few architectural hints, there is nothing to indicate, for example, that a thriving KTV pub along Arab Street was once the site of a printing office for the religious magazine Al-Imam, or that the popular toy store along Bussorah Street once attracted a crowd of a different sort in the early 19th century as the office of Javanese printer, Haji Muhammad Siraj. In this regard, the trail aids also help participants to imagine for themselves a historical impression of the area as it would have been like at different points in time.
Continuities do, however, exist between present sites in Kampong Gelam and their past incarnations as printing offices. The site of Islamic Restaurant, currently located at 745 North Bridge Road, is still owned by the family of Abu Talib bin Ally as of 2017, who previously ran Royal Press. In a different manner, the Sultan Hotel’s tours at its three-storey shophouse unit has also served to introduce visitors to the building’s previous history as the site of Al-Ahmadiah Press and HARMY Press.

Interacting with the family of Abu Talib bin Ally and the management of the Sultan Hotel revealed a second and possibly more important aspect of the trail. Through this trail, museum practitioners were pushed to engage with the descendants and inheritors of these legacies. Whilst the trail aids filled gaps in the historical narrative of the area, it was these anecdotes from people who formerly lived and who continue to work in the area that enlivened the trail.
Engaging such individuals and families also facilitates MHC’s efforts in building itself as an institution of and for the area from which it operates. In this regard, the exhibition could be seen as expanding upon the premise established by MHC’s 2015 exhibition – Kampong Gelam: Beyond the Port Town which considered the cultural, economic and social histories of Kampong Gelam. This exhibition and trail continues to follow that train of thought, by looking specifically to the printers and publishers of the area, who in many ways contributed to the economic and cultural vibrancy of the area. Indeed, from the heart of a port town, one is invited to cast a closer look at the many printing and publishing offices that once called Kampong Gelam home.

When the Global Indian International School (GIIS) donated towards an exhibition at the Indian Heritage Centre, they showed their students what it means to practice a strong philosophy of giving.

“The Global Indian International School (GIIS) believes that expatriates are part of its multi-faceted heritage, hence they should upkeep Singapore's social fabric,” said Rohit Ambekar, Director of Business & Strategy for GIIS.
The overarching Global Schools Foundation has educated numerous expatriate children, from Kindergarten to Class 12 since its origin in 2002, and presently has 15,000 students across all its campuses globally.
Students from 42 nationalities study in its three campuses, located in Queenstown, Balestier and East Coast in Singapore. GIIS has a global footprint in seven countries - Singapore, India, Malaysia, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and UAE.
“Our core curriculum is Indian and our roots are embedded in Indian culture and heritage. But, our education system is more pluralistic than that,” Mr Ambekar explained.
Among other goals, GIIS hopes to instil a respect for universal values and ethics, which is “very much in tune with multiculturalism and the coexistence of different races in Singapore,” he said.
With this in mind, GIIS made a generous donation in support of the Indian Heritage Centre's ‘Once Upon a Time in Little India’ exhibition last year. It runs until 21st July 2017.
“We wanted to be associated with the Indian culture at a deeper level. Intuitively, you would think that labelling something as an Indian exhibition is divisive. But, it's actually very beautiful,” said Mr Ambekar.
“When the Indian culture came to Singapore, it was hybridised with the other predominant Chinese and Malay cultures. The exhibition showcases the contributions of Indians with a uniquely Singapore spin,” he added.
Engaging visitors
The exhibition tells the story of Little India – a cultural enclave for the South Asian community – through photographs, artefacts, and contemporary art installations.
It features the works of filmmaker K. Rajagopal, and artists Kumari Nahappan and Navin Rawanchaikul. Groups of GIIS students have visited the exhibition.
Elements of gamification and virtual reality, found in the centre, kept students engaged. “They put a very interesting, modern spin on heritage issues,” Mr Ambekar said.
“The feedback has been great. Students loved the exhibition and the Indian Heritage Centre. And, of course, being young children, they enjoyed the day out as well,” he shared.
Mr Ambekar, who has visited museums around the world, was just as impressed with the centre's larger-than-life LED wall. While moving between galleries, visitors can get closer to colourful displays of Indian icons and architecture.
“I'm a modern tech geek,” quipped Mr Ambekar. “I appreciate the amount of thought that's gone into the minutiae, in creating something which is just one part of an overall exhibition.”
What's next
Like many institutions, GIIS hopes to be a role model for the young. This means the school focuses on more than academics. Its curriculum includes sports, problem solving and community service.
“We're a platform that allows young people to shape their future. If someone wants to become an entrepreneur, we help them. If someone wants to teach or dedicate their lives to volunteer work, we help with that,” Mr Ambekar said.
“I'd like to think that the leaders of tomorrow are going to need much more than good results,” he added.
Still, more can be done to get the young excited about heritage. The ongoing dialogue between schools and key stakeholders is a good start, Mr Ambekar said.
He added that students may enjoy visiting other museums and heritage sites, and walking along historical stretches of Singapore, such as Boat Quay.
A culture of giving
To recognise its contributions, GIIS will receive one of this year's Patron of Heritage Awards in May.
“On the most basic level, contributing creates awareness. Philanthropy is part of our DNA, being owned by a foundation, so we will continue to do so,” said Mr Ambekar.
“We try to imbibe that kind of giving philosophy in our students as well. So, when they grow up in their own spheres, as they become successful, they will think about others and not entirely about themselves,” he added.
The school hopes to continue giving more than dollars and cents. “I'd like to see us engaging (with heritage) in a deeper way. This is something that will evolve over time,” Mr Ambekar said.
“It's our belief that we are a core part of the Indian heritage of Singapore. By offering Indians a continuity of education, we have enabled a funnel of Indian expatriates to come and contribute to the economy.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/patrons-of-heritage/Givaudan,"Scents of Singapore’s History
A fragrance company is donating old, familiar smells to enhance visitors’ experience of museums.
Ben Webb, the regional head of fragrances at Givaudan Singapore.
The Singapore River smelled bad in the 1970s. Hawkers, squatters, and manufacturers crowded the river banks and treated the river as if it were a toilet and bin centre. In 1977, the government started cleaning it up. Over the next 10 years, it spent $170 million on the river — first relocating the people and businesses and then dredging out the stinky mud.
So, it was peculiar to many when the National Museum of Singapore revived the acrid river smell for its permanent galleries during Singapore’s 50th anniversary in 2015. Repulsive it may be, but the museum hoped this stench would evoke sweet memories of a bygone era. After all, the Singapore River has witnessed many of this country’s significant economic and social activities.
Donated scents
Swiss fragrance company Givaudan helped the museum create the sensorial exhibition. “It was a very natural collaboration between us because scents have such amazing powers to transport us back to a memory, a place or a time in our lives,” says Ben Webb, the company’s Head of Fragrance Division in Asia Pacific. This power has to do with how the brain areas are connected. The olfactory bulb where the smell is understood, Ben explains, is closely linked to the brain regions that handle memory and emotion. This is why elderly visitors to the gallery experience a flood of memories from before the 70s, while those much younger have a deeper experience of Singapore’s history.
Because the stench of the river is no more, Givaudan’s perfumer, Sreevidhya Venkatesh, relied on archival research and oral histories to identify the characters and activities that might have contributed to this unforgettable smell. She eventually narrowed it down to the spice traders, the cooked-food hawkers, and the diesel-powered boats.
Besides the smell of the Singapore River, Givaudan also donated other scents to the museum. Visitors entering a gallery on the city’s colonial past can smell “Afternoon Tea” just as the British would have, while a “Tembusu flowers” scent accompanies an exhibit that looks at Singapore’s greening efforts. The latter came to the attention of perfumer, Claude Charmoille, when he first moved to Singapore. He noticed the scent during his evening walks and managed to trace it to this towering tree species that is indigenous to Singapore. For him, and probably many others, the tembusu fragrance evokes images of Singapore as a garden city.
Givaudan not only emulated environmental scents for the museum, but also created a new fragrance to mark Singapore’s jubilee. The limited-edition unisex perfume, City, is made from a blend of local ingredients ranging from orchids to ambrettes so that it encapsulates this city’s “energy and dynamism”, says Ben.
Received POHA
The National Heritage Board honoured Givaudan with a Patron of Heritage award in recognition of the company’s efforts to enhance visitors’ experience of Singapore’s history at the National Museum. Ben says Givaudan is very happy to contribute its technical and creative expertise to the National Museum. It has also done so for the Malay Heritage Centre, Taman Jurong’s community museum, and a Scents and Memories workshop at the Singapore Heritage Festival 2016.
“Heritage is especially important to Givaudan as our company has been around for almost 250 years,” adds Ben.  
Besides contributions by corporations like his, Ben says the local community plays an important role in keeping heritage alive. Givaudan depended on it for guidance and feedback when recreating scents for the Malay Heritage Centre recently.
“The public is very much a part of creating connections to the nation’s heritage either by passing on their own memories or by creating new ones whenever they visit the museums,” says Ben.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/A-Taste-of-History-at-Little-India/Story,"Mention Little India, and popular eateries such as Komala Vilas and Banana Leaf Apolo come to mind. These are some of the iconic food spots that have grown to be synonymous with Little India, alongside the likes of Tekka Market, Little India Arcade and Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple.
And if you have gone on the Little India Heritage Trail, or taken a stroll through the precinct, food undeniably stands out as a distinctive slice of Little India’s unique character and identity. And it is especially heart-warming to know that many of these eateries, whether well-established restaurants or quaint coffee stalls, still remain as family-run businesses steeped in heritage, with rich histories and intimate stories to share. These are living testaments of our intangible food heritage, where traditional recipes, some concocted within family kitchens, are passed down through generations and shared with all Singaporeans. Here, are some insights into these families, their food and their stories.
On 76 Serangoon Road stands Komala Vilas, the oldest restaurant in Little India. The South Indian vegetarian restaurant was opened in 1947 by Murugiah Rajoo, who arrived from the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu, India, in 1936.
Masala Thosai at Komala Vilas
In his quest to create an authentic Indian dining experience, Murugiah may have introduced masala thosai, (a thin crepe made from rice and lentils, and stuffed with potato, methi and curry) for which the restaurant is famous for, to Singapore.
“You have to serve good food, which is tasty, and is reasonably priced,” says Mr Rajoo Gunasekaran, Komala Vilas’ Managing Director and son of its founder. “Word gets around, and when people from India come to visit Singapore, they come here too,” he explains. Mr Gunasekaran, 65, says that he has done little to change the way the business has been run, 70 years into its existence.
Mr Rajoo Gunasekaran, Managing Director of Komala Villas
“I took over from my father in 1980, and I have always followed the traditional way of running this business,” he adds. This means he makes sure the restaurant gets the basics of taste and quality right, and that customers are properly and politely served. On any given day, Mr Rajoo can also be seen seated behind the cashier’s till collecting payments, which are usually made in cash. His son, Rajakumar, like him, will take over from his father one day.
Khan’s Restaurant at 149 Dunlop Street is another setup run by father and son. It opened 15 years ago after moving from its original location at Beach Road. Says Mr Yousof Khan, 60, “Our customers can be quite fussy. They will tell me if something’s not right, but that’s good because it shows they care.”
According to Mr Yousof, the area around Dunlop Street was practically empty when he first moved in. “Now you see different people coming here, locals as well as tourists,” he quips.
Did you know that the Madras New Woodlands Restaurant on 10 Upper Dickson Road has absolutely nothing to do with Woodlands, where the Causeway is situated?
Thali with Battura bread at Madras New Woodlands
“Woodlands is actually a well-known place in Madras (now Chennai); an area of trees and cottages,” explains its owner, Mr A Dinakaran, who is in his 60s. Opened in 1983, the restaurant hires its chefs from India.
“Our chefs are trained for years, and they grew up as cooks. They did not learn to cook at a college. Theirs is the authentic passing down of traditional vegetarian cuisine, which makes our food authentic,” insists Mr Dino, as he is often called. He adds that his is the first restaurant in Little India to have an open kitchen.
“I wanted Indian food to shine, to be known to the other races. With Singapore being a multi-cultural society, I felt that other ethnic groups must know how Indian food is prepared,” explains Mr Dino.
However, being a restaurant owner was not his initial plan. While studying to be a vet, he dropped out of university and entered the food business after his parents ran into financial trouble. “I had the entrepreneurial spirit to make money, mainly because my parents ran out of money,” says Mr Dino.
Mr C Sankaranathan had quite the opposite experience. The group CEO of the Apollo Group, which runs Banana Leaf Apolo Restaurant at 54 Race Course Road, was 12 when his father asked him if he should sell the business to a businessman from Hong Kong, who was offering $10 million for it.
“I said no,” shares Mr Sanker, 45. “We grew up with the business. We know a lot of our customers. I thought, what are we going to do when it is gone?”
The restaurant got its name from his father, who was a fruit seller before opening the restaurant in 1974. “It was named Banana Leaf after the traditional way in which Indians eat – from a banana leaf,” explains Mr Sankar. And Apolo? “That came from the Apollo spaceship which made a moon landing (in 1969),” says Mr Sankar. He said his father wanted the success of the restaurant to go to the moon, so he called it Apollo. It was changed to Apolo because of his father’s belief in numerology.

“The restaurant opened at Cuff Road when I was 2. My father started with a unique menu, which had fish head curry, and it attracted lots of Chinese customers. The crowds started coming after that.” The restaurant moved to its current location in 1986, and one person who remembers it from its days at Cuff Road is Mr V Vijaykumarr, 48, who first went to the restaurant in 1980, when he was 12.
“It was a treat from my parents for doing well in my PSLE exams,” said Mr Vijay. “I asked to be taken to a restaurant, and the fact they chose this one says a lot. It was, for me, a first love. Over the years, I have come to this restaurant and they have always kept their high standards,” adds Mr Vijay.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Caldecott-Through-the-Years/story,"For the past 80 years, you have known it as the stomping ground of Singapore’s best-loved television and radio stars, and where our television classics such as ‘Under One Roof’, ‘The Unbeatables’ and ‘The Little Nyonya’ were created.
What is lesser known is Caldecott Hill’s long history that predates the arrival of radio and television to our shores. The hill was named after Sir Andrew Caldecott, the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements in the 1930s, and its roads, named after members of his family, namely Lady Olive, his wife (Olive Road), and Joan and John, their children (Joan Road and John Road). These colourful personalities and little-known tales of Caldecott Hill’s past deserve their own retelling.
Thomson’s Roads
Long before the Housing and Development Board and urban planners of our time, Caldecott was part of the larger Toa Payoh district, where it started off as a large undeveloped marshland in the early 1800s.
All that changed when Englishman John Turnbull Thomson arrived in Singapore 1841 as a Government Surveyor. Thomson put together the very first maps of Singapore’s town centre, and also engineered the building of Thomson Road, among other important contributions during his 12 years in Singapore.
Under Thomson’s charge, proper roads were built through the Toa Payoh district, which changed the composition of the area entirely. The roads enabled access to areas that were previously impassable and the surrounding rural land could be developed.
Seah’s Legacy
Seah Eu Chin, also popularly known as the “king of pepper and gambier” in his time, was a Chinese immigrant who made a fortune from trading in pepper and gambier during the 19th century.
Portrait of Seah Eu Chin, Collection of National Museum of Singapore
Back then, the Thomson and Caldecott area was a place where rich businessmen set up plantation houses and grew crops. Among them was Seah Eu Chin. Legal documents show his family may have owned most of the areas in the Caldecott district at different points in history, and lived in the area. In fact, the Seah family had built two large bungalows there, one of which was called E Choon, where a grand ball was held for prominent Europeans and Chinese guests. This attracted great attention because it was the first time a large gathering of Europeans and Chinese participated in a grand ball within a Chinese setting.
An interesting story has been told of how Seah Eu Chin’s son, Seah Liang Seah, reportedly shot and killed an eight-feet long alligator, who had been taking swims in the family pool and feasting on the fish in their pond. During this time, tiger sightings in other plantations along Thomson Road were also common, and livestock and coolies were known to be carried away by these felines.
Revamping Public Housing
In 1935, there was increased confidence in the real estate business in Singapore, boosted by a demand for cheap modern houses. Local based firm, Fogden. Brisbane and Co. Ltd. mooted the idea of building a large number of suburban houses on Caldecott Hill, to be rented out as affordable housing. Fogden and Brisbane were at this time one of the four biggest development firms in Malaya, and they had the resources to invest in the undertaking.
When completed in 1937, the local newspapers reported that Caldecott Hill Estate was the latest “modern home”, replete with perks such as electricity, piped water and modern sanitation facilities. The last item, in particular, was still a novelty for most houses in Singapore at that time. Many were still using the “Night Bucket” (night-soil bucket) system.
Radio Through the War
Caldecott Hill saw further transformations with the building of Singapore’s first permanent radio broadcasting station, which was built on Caldecott Hill and opened in 1937. At the first regular broadcast at its opening, then-Governor Sir Shenton Thomas described the interior of the broadcasting station – the sound proof studios with air-conditioning, and rooms for performers, announcer and control engineer. In the years following its opening, the Government established the Malaya Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) and made plans to develop it. However, the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945 was a disruption to plans to develop the MBC.
When the war came in 1942, it was said that the battle lines stopped right at the edge of Caldecott Hill Estate. The broadcasting station survived the battle and it was used by the Japanese during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore in World War II.
Lights, Camera, Action!
After the war, only 41 houses in Caldecott Hill Estate survived. The area continued to be a residential estate. By the 1990s, the area had become a premier private housing estate, save for the Caldecott Broadcast Centre.
From radio to TV, the broadcast station at Caldecott Hill was inextricably linked to the blossoming of Singapore’s media scene. Radio-Television Singapore, the predecessor to today’s Mediacorp, opened its new Television Studio Centre in 1966, an event graced by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1966, and it is the predecessor to today’s MediaCorp, In December 2015, MediaCorp made its move from the Caldecott Broadcast Centre in Andrew Road, which had been its home for the past 63 years, to its new home at Mediapolis in One-North.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/patrons-of-heritage/Dr-Tan-Tsze-Chor,"Carrying a father's legacy
After Dr Tan Tsze Chor – a businessman, calligrapher, and generous supporter of the arts – died in 1983, the family donated over 100 works to the Asian Civilisations Museum in early 2000 and grew an art fund in his name.

Being an avid collector of Chinese art, the late Dr Tan Tsze Chor regularly hosted dinner parties at home. The property had to be dressed to entertain. This was a task for his son, Mr Tan Gek Gnee. Growing up, Mr Tan was regularly handed a list of paintings that needed to be displayed.
“I would search for them and hang them on the walls in our gallery,” Mr Tan said. “My father would inspect how the paintings were hung. The height and distance between them had to be correct. More importantly, they needed to look pleasant to the eye,” he added.
“That was how detailed and serious his character was, whether with work or his love for art,” Mr Tan, who is now in his 60s, explained.
Simple beginnings
Dr Tan was born in Singapore in 1911. He returned to China with his parents in 1917 for his studies, but made another trip to the city-state years later to find work.
At hardly 16 years of age, Dr Tan found a job as a peon. That was when he grew interested in calligraphy. At night, he religiously practised writing, using newspapers because he could get them for free.
“My father told me that when you make a mistake while painting, you can correct it by covering the area with another colour or pattern,” Mr Tan said.
“But with calligraphy, if a dot or stroke is too thick, it is not possible to correct the mistake because the word will look awkward,” he added.
Dr Tan slowly carved a name for himself at work and in the realm of art. He became a successful Teochew businessman, dealing with pepper, gambier, rubber, coffee, and other local produce.
Dr Tan’s calligraphy was exhibited in Singapore and Taiwan.
Getting to know artists
Dr Tan frequently reached out to artists, to get a better understanding of their paintings. He made friends with Chinese artists like Xu Beihong, Qi Baishi, Zhang Daqian, and Huang Binhong.
His collection and studio, named Xiang Xue Zhuang, had valuable masterpieces by Xu, Qi, Ren Yi, and Pan Tianshou, among others. The name Xiang Xue Zhuang was an allusion to the fragrance of the plum blossom.
At its peak between the 1950s and 1980s, there were over a few hundred objects in the collection. This included paintings, commissioned portraits of Dr Tan and his wife, porcelains, and other objects.
While most items were brought to his attention, Dr Tan would buy high quality ceramics from New York and London.
When Mr Tan and his siblings were born, Dr Tan doted on them and regularly took his family to the movies and to restaurants for dinner. He continued to practise calligraphy twice a week.
Mr Tan recalled making folds on rice paper so his father could write weekly. “His calligraphy has its own style. When people see it, they know straight away that it is the work of Dr Tan Tsze Chor,” Mr Tan said.
In 1977, Dr Tan worked with the Singapore Art Society to set up the Tan Tsze Chor Art Fund, to support the development of local art and artists.
In recognition of his contribution to the arts, Dr Tan was conferred an honorary doctorate by the Hua Gang College of Chinese Culture, part of the present-day Chinese Culture University in Taiwan.
Mr Tan Tsze Chor passed away in 1983.
Valuable gifts of art
Since 2000, the Tan family has donated over 100 works from Dr Tan's collection to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM). They also donated close to 500 volumes from Dr Tan’s collection of books on Chinese art to the ACM library.
In 2003 to 2004, an exhibition of the paintings and ceramics given by the family of Dr Tan Tsze Chor was presented at ACM’s premises in Armenian Street. A gallery was also named in Dr Tan’s honour.
To mark the publication of the Xiang Xue Zhuang Collection catalogue, a display of objects from the collection was held at the Tan Tsze Chor ACM from 2006 to 2007.
After Dr Tan's death, the Tan family agreed to grow the Tan Tsze Chor Art Fund. At that time, the money was put in a bank. Any interest it garnered was offered as prize money at a yearly art competition.
They grew the fund significantly and decided to invest in equities to get a better rate of return.
“We hope to invest wisely and build up the fund, so that we will be able to increase the prize money in the future,” Mr Tan said.
Mr Tan is currently the Managing Director of Chiang Hong Private Limited, a company that his father started. Over the years, it has veered off distributing food items and now deals with investments instead.
“Because my father was a perfectionist, being his right-hand man, I have learned to follow in his footsteps,” Mr Tan shared.
Among the items, a painting of horses by Xu Beihong and a set of his father's calligraphic works are Mr Tan's favourites.
“Our family wanted to honour our father and decided to donate the best of his Chinese art collection to ACM,” Mr Tan said. “The objective was to carry on his legacy of promoting Chinese works of art, by sharing his art collection with the general public.”
Mr Tan hopes the collection will speak to Singaporeans and especially the young.
“Good design sells products from cars to houses, furniture, and phones. We hope that young artistic minds will be stimulated, once they have the opportunity to study beautiful artworks on display in the museums,” Mr Tan said.
“Eventually, they may be able to create artefacts that are even more beautiful,” he quipped.

Lim Bo Seng (27 April 1909–29 June 1944) might have been tortured by the Japanese for days on end, but it was having to leave his family behind for their own safety that tore at the heart and spirit of the father of eight.
Portrait of Lim Bo Seng (c1941–1944. Image from the Lim Leong Geok Collection, National Archives of Singapore)
Lim Bo Seng, the first son of contractor Lim Loh, was born in a 99-room family housing complex in Fujian’s Nan’an County in China.1 He left for Singapore at 16 and studied at the prestigious Raffles Institution2 where he was classmates with individuals such as Yusof Ishak, the future president of Singapore.3
In 1929, Lim cut short his studies at the University of Hong Kong to take over his father’s businesses, one of which was a well-known construction company involved in the erection of major landmarks such as Goodwood Park Hotel, Victoria Memorial Hall and Old Parliament House.4 Lim’s business acumen put him in good stead to manage and grow his father’s businesses. As a result he also became a prominent merchant.5 On top of this, Lim served in key positions in a number of associations such as the Singapore Contractors Association, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Singapore Hokkien Association.6
Lim married teacher Gan Choo Neo in 1930.7 She bore him eight children, one of whom died at a young age.8 He was a loving father, taking his children to High Street on weekends to read and buy books at Ensign Bookshop before adjourning to Polar Cafe for cake and ice cream.9
When war broke out in China, Lim stepped forward and took on an active role in resisting Japanese advances, earning himself a distinguished place in history as one of Malaya’s foremost war heroes. But his anti-war efforts required great sacrifice. When Singapore fell to the Japanese, Lim found himself having little choice but to separate from his beloved family.
Clandestine missions
Lim’s anti-war efforts, where he organised fundraisers and protests, began in the 1930s, before the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese war.
In December 1941, Japanese troops infiltrated Kota Bharu in Malaya in an amphibious attack. Alarmed, the British called on Lim to help bolster Singapore’s defence infrastructure. As head of Labour Services of the Overseas Chinese Mobilisation Council, he gathered 10,000 men to erect defences, run key services for the population, and blow up the Causeway — a means in which the Japanese could storm Singapore.
With the Japanese on Singapore’s doorstep, arrangements were made for Lim and his family to leave for their safety. However, with the Japanese sinking evacuating vessels, Lim made the call to have them stay on in Singapore, choosing instead to leave their side.
In a diary entry dated 11 February 1942, just days before the fall of Singapore, Lim wrote that the decision to separate pained him greatly. “To leave the dear Mrs behind at the mercy of the enemy would go very hard against my own conscience. On the other hand, to remain with the family in the event of enemy occupation, would not in any way improve the situation but my presence may even make their lot very much harder.”
He added that his children were ""too stupefied to realise what was happening” as they kissed him goodbye. “I shall never forget the tear-stained faces as long as I live. If there is anything I could do to make up for what they were then going through, I shall not spare myself to carry it out.” It was the last time he would see them. .
Lim left soon after by sampan, observing in his diary that the sky was lit up by enemy fire in three directions — Pasir Panjang, Serangoon and Bukit Timah.10 By morning, Singapore was “enveloped in a pall of smoke”.
Lim eventually found his way to India, joining Force 136, a secret service unit established by the British and Chinese governments to recapture Singapore.11 He was responsible for recruiting Chinese espionage agents who could blend in with locals to gather intelligence.12
Upon completion of their training, teams from Force 136 boarded a Dutch submarine from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to re-enter the Japanese controlled territory of Malaya.13 Lim was among them. While in Malaya, Force 136 attempted to collaborate with the area’s main resistance movement, the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army. It also set up a covert network to gather intelligence.14
Later, following some blunders and a betrayal, information was divulged to the Japanese which led to the arrests of Force 136 agents. Lim, who had left the group’s Bukit Bidor camp to raise funds and expand its intelligence network, was also arrested.15
Lim was mercilessly starved and tortured for information by Japanese military police at the Batu Gajah Gaol where he was incarcerated. They failed to break him. Despite his own plight, Lim shared his meagre food rations with fellow prisoners. Compatriots who witnessed his last days in prison said he had been ""reduced to a bag of bones"".16 He eventually died of malnutrition, dysentery and torture at 35.17 Wrapped in a tattered blanket, he was taken away in a wooden cart and buried in a mass grave near the prison grounds.18
A hero’s return
In Singapore, the Japanese who were baying for blood, were successful in hunting down and killing eight of Lim’s relatives living at 855 Serangoon Road — a compound comprising three houses built by Lim Loh.19 Lim’s wife, however, managed to outwit them, moving her family from one hideout to another. At one point, she even sought refuge at St John’s Island.20
Following his unceremonious burial in Batu Gajah, Lim’s remains were brought back to Singapore.21 After a funeral at City Hall, he was laid to rest with full military honours on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir where he used to court his wife.22 He was posthumously awarded the rank of major-general by the Chinese Nationalist government in 1946.

On the 10th anniversary of his death, a memorial built in his honour was unveiled at Esplanade Park. It is the only World War II memorial in Singapore dedicated to an individual. It was gazetted a national monument in 2010 alongside two other structures in the park.
In 2016, Lim’s personal diary which he left behind for his heartbroken wife, resurfaced. One entry reads: “You must not grieve for me. On the other hand, you should take pride in my sacrifice and devote yourself to the upbringing of the children. Tell them what happened to me and direct them along my footsteps.”

P Ramlee was an actor, singer, songwriter and director whose star shone brightly during the golden age of Malay films, earning him fans in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The entertainer died at 44 from a heart attack but by then had acted in 66 films, directed 35, and composed 250 songs.1 His popularity stemmed from his ability to reflect the issues and concerns of his time, offering viewers a mirror to examine themselves and their place in a changing world.
Watch: Roots.SG Presents: The Golden Era P. Ramlee
  An early interest in music
P. Ramlee (22 March 1929 - 29 May 1973) was born Teuku Zakaria to a Penang-born woman and a sailor from Aceh, Indonesia.
He grew up in Penang where he studied at Sekolah Melayu Kampung Jawa (Kampung Jawa Malay School), the Francis Light English School, as well as the Penang Free School. The name Ramlee had been used to register him for classes.
Ramlee much preferred music to school. When the Japanese invasion disrupted his school life, Ramlee, then 13, pounced at the chance to focus more on it. Over the course of the war, he picked up the basics of music, joined his village band, Teruna Sekampung, and even learned how to sing in Japanese.2 After the war concluded, he signed up for lessons to read musical notations.
At 16, a more confident Ramlee participated in a singing competition organised by Penang Radio for contestants in North Malaya. He participated in the contest three years in a row before emerging top on his third attempt in 1947.3 It was during this period that he added the initial initial “P.” (for “Puteh”) to his name.
As luck would have it, Ramlee was talent-spotted by B. S. Rajhans, a director working with Shaw Brothers, while singing at a keroncong show in Penang in 1948.4 He was invited to join the studio's Malay Film Productions arm to record songs for soundtracks and lip-synching actors. Ramlee accepted the offer, leaving Penang for Singapore with his violin in 1949. As part of his audition, he sang his first composition Azizah, after an unfulfilled romance,5 at a studio located on Jalan Ampas off Balestier Road.6

During his early days with the studio, Ramlee took on work as a clapper boy and assistant cameraman, attesting to his down-to-earth nature.7 The Shaws, however, could tell that he had star power and did not keep him in the wings for long. Ramlee, after all, was a rare talent who could sing beautifully and act well. In 1950, he made his debut as a leading man in the films Bakti (Devotion) and Takdir Ilahi (Will of God, 1950).
Audiences were captivated by the charismatic actor, particularly for his ability to represent tensions between kampung and urban life.8 Known for his ability to pack movie theatres, Ramlee was reportedly paid $30,000 per film and had his fair share of super fans.9, 10
During a brief lull in his career, Ramlee spent some time in Johor Bahru, Malaya before rejoining the Shaws' Malay Film Productions to star in Penghidupan (Life) which was released in May 1951. He was also involved in a string of other films.
When he was 26, the Shaws gave Ramlee his directorial break. The appointment was a significant milestone for Malay film as it helped the industry break away from the influence of Indian cinema.11 Malay movies had up till that point been directed by Indian directors.12
Ramlee proved to be as talented a director as he was an actor. His various directorial efforts, many of which dealt with universal themes,13 earned him regional acclaim. Run Run Shaw, the co-founder of Shaw Studio, had a fairly close working relationship with Ramlee, and the pair were said to have attended film festivals together.14
Ramlee's best known works might have been Huah Tuah (1956), Musang Berjanggut (The Bearded Fox, 1959) and Madu Tiga (The Three Wives, 1964),15 but it was his comedic roles, such as in the series Bujang Lapok where he delighted audiences as a happy-go-lucky bachelor, or in Labu dan Labi (1962) where he played a bumbling servant, which endeared him the most to audiences.16
Ramlee, who married thrice in his lifetime, also tried his hand at directing theatrical productions. Kachip Mas (1961), for instance, was one such production which ran at Victoria Theatre as well as amusement parks Happy World and New World.
P. Ramlee's third wife, singer-actress Salmah binti Ismail whose stage name was Saloma.
In 1964, Ramlee joined the Shaws' Merdeka Film Productions in Malaysia where he made a number of films before the studio wound down in 1977.17
Away from the big screen, Ramlee's talents as a vocalist were sought after by recording companies such as Hemsley & Co., and His Master's Voice (HMV). At Hemsley & Co., Ramlee's composition Azizah took flight, earning him an honorarium. Meanwhile, the region's airwaves were graced by Ramlee's melodic vocals via Radio Malaya broadcasts as part of his involvement with HMV.18

Remembering the showman
The prolific showman's life was cut short after suffering from a heart attack at 44. He was buried at the Jalan Ampang Muslim Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
Halls, museums and buildings have been named in his honour. For instance, Caunter Hall, the road he was born on in Penang, was renamed Jalan P. Ramlee. The kampung house he grew up in was also restored. In Malaysia, two memorials have been dedicated to the late star.
In 1990, Ramlee was posthumously conferred the honorific title of Tan Sri.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/lieutenant-adnan-and-the-battle-of-bukit-chandu/story,"TL;DR
In February 1942, Lieutenant Adnan Saidi led a small group of fighters against a 13,000-strong, battle-hardened Japanese force hell bent on capturing Singapore1. Despite the odds stacked against them, they held their ground for three days, momentarily thwarting the veteran army’s plans.
More than a year into work as a trainee teacher in his hometown of Kajang in Selangor, Malaysia, 18-year-old Adnan Saidi made the life-changing decision to switch careers by joining a military unit specially established for Malays.
The year was 1933 and the unit, which came to be known as the Malay Regiment, had been set up by the British to provide employment opportunities for young Malay men2. Its initial recruitment drive attracted 1,000 candidates of whom 25 were selected.3
Adnan proved to be the Regiment’s most outstanding enlistee, picking up its best recruit award in 1934.4 Along the way, he became a company officer, and was selected to march in a parade in London to honour King George VI’s ascension to the throne.
In 1939, as a brutal war unfolded in Europe, the Regiment began ramping up training exercises. Two years later, amid the rumblings of an impending war in the Far East, Adnan took up a post in Singapore, bringing along his pregnant wife, Sophia Pakih Muda, a teacher by vocation, and two sons. They lived in a house off Pasir Panjang designated for Malay Regiment officers.5

This arrangement, however, was short-lived. As air raids increased in frequency, Adnan sent his children and wife home to Selangor by train. They said their goodbyes at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, with the boys kissing their father’s hand.6 It was the last they would see of each other. According to the recollections of older son Mokhtar, Adnan told them to take care of themselves and be good. “I didn’t know it would be the last time I would see my father,” Mokhtar is recorded as having said. “I was only three years old, but I [can] still remember his face.”7

On 8 December 1941, about an hour before the notorious Japanese attack of Pearl Harbour on the other side of the world, General Tomoyuki Yamashita’s men began their invasion of Southeast Asia via the coast of a sleepy fishing village in Kota Bharu, northern Malaya.8 Battle-hardened Japanese troops, commandeering stolen bicycles, made their way on bicycles and motor vehicles into Singapore through the western flank of the Malay Peninsula.9 From 8 to 15 February 1942, the army stunned and overwhelmed Singapore’s defences.
One of the fiercest battles leading up to the fall of Singapore took place at Pasir Panjang Ridge which comprised key military installations such as the British Military Hospital, as well as ammunition and supply depots.
The Japanese had spent the morning of 13 February 1942 inundating the Malay Regiment held area with gunfire and bombs.10 Together with his men, Adnan, a company officer of the 7th Platoon in C Company, was tasked with holding down the fort. Positioned along Reformatory Road11, they were successful in keeping the Japanese’s 18th Division at bay.12
By midnight, Adnan’s company was instructed to regroup at Opium Hill.13 There, Adnan ordered his men to place sandbags around the site to buy themselves time.14 By early afternoon on 14 February, rather desperate members of the Japanese Imperial Army spotting turbans, tried to sneak onto the hill disguised as Sikh members of the British Indian Army. Their attempt to gain ground was foiled by Adnan and 2nd Lieutenant Abbas bin Abdul Manan who noticed they were marching in formations of four instead of three.15 Adnan ordered his men to fire at them. In all, 22 enemy soldiers were killed leading to their momentary retreat.
Two hours later, the Japanese returned with a vengeance. Thousands of soldiers equipped with ample fire power swarmed the site. Despite the heavy shelling, the company held on. When their bullets ran out, they charged at the Japanese, fighting them with only their bayonets and their bare hands.16
The Japanese then had survivors like the badly wounded Adnan executed. Placed in a gunny sack, he was hung upside down from a cherry tree and ruthlessly stabbed to death.17
That was not the end of it. Thirsty for blood, the enemy forces sought out Adnan’s family. To protect themselves, they rid their home of his belongings.
Wrecked by the news of her husband’s death, Adnan’s wife was said to have clammed up whenever her children asked her about him.
For his valour, the British awarded Adnan posthumous campaign medals.18 In Singapore, Adnan and his men are remembered at a museum called Reflections at Bukit Chandu which opened in 2002. The pièce de résistance at the museum, which reopened in 2021 after a revamp, is a rare and moving clip of Adnan training his troops. It is also at this very site that his values, including his motto, “biar putih tulang, jangan putih mata” (better to die than to live in shame in Malay) live on.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Dalforce-Dalleys-Desperadoes/story,"One of the military units that defended Singapore from the Japanese was a group of Chinese volunteers with barely any training or weapons.
Cheng Seang Ho was not a typical soldier. She was a 66 year-old grandmother. However, on 11 February 1942, she fought fiercely in the Battle of Bukit Timah, firing a shotgun at the Japanese invaders, taking shelter with her husband behind a row of blasted tree stumps.
She was part of a small army called Dalforce. Her fellow soldiers came from all walks of life. They included students, labourers, office workers, secret society members, rickshaw pullers, and dancing girls from nightclubs. Many were members of the Malayan Communist Party. They had been released from prison, just so that they could fight to defend Singapore.
The British had recruited their army only a month earlier, in January. Before that, they had not trusted the Chinese enough to defend Singapore. Instead, they had decided to mainly use soldiers from other parts of the British empire, such as Australia and India.
These stills of Chinese volunteers in Singapore are from a 1941 British Pathé newsreel, which is available on YouTube. Source: British Pathé
However, as soon as they made a call for Chinese volunteers, thousands of people turned up. Not all of them were from Singapore. Some from Malaya crossed the Causeway just so they could help with the war effort. Around 3,000 people were recruited, although only about 1,250 were actually enlisted into training.
The Chinese called this army “the Singapore Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army” (星华义勇军). The British called it Dalforce, using the name of the commander, John Dalley, a lieutenant colonel from the police. He had been trying to convince the government to form this army from way back in 1940.
Now, there was no time to prepare these new soldiers properly. They were only given three to 14 days of training in basic military skills. On 5 February, they were sent into action, wearing blue uniforms, with red triangles on their right sleeves.
The soldiers were extremely poorly equipped. They had no helmets, so they wrapped yellow cloths around their heads. They also had very few weapons: long knives called parangs, shotguns and hunting rifles, some with as few as seven bullets. They were not even given enough food supplies.
Nevertheless, they impressed the full-time soldiers from Australia and the United Kingdom with their toughness and bravery. In Kranji, one unit battled against a Japanese machine-gun battalion until all 200 of them were killed. In contrast, an Australian unit retreated from the location, even though it was armed with machine guns.
There are unconfirmed stories that they managed to sink several rubber rafts which the Japanese used to travel from Malaya. General Yamashita actually considered stopping the invasion on 10 February, because the resistance was so strong.
Dalforce member Teo Choon Hong later explained to researchers why he had fought so desperately. “I didn’t think I would be safe behind the line,” he said. “Since it wasn’t safe, I might as well go to the front to resist them, to fight them. If I could kill one Japanese my sacrifice would be rewarded.”
Sadly, these heroes could not change the course of the war. On 13 February, Lieutenant Colonel Dalley gathered them at headquarters and announced that the British government had decided to stop fighting. He paid each of the volunteers $10 and made them give up their weapons. He then ordered the weapons to be buried.
300 Dalforce soldiers were killed in the battles. Many more would be slaughtered by the Japanese during the Occupation, including Madam Cheng’s husband. Some of them continued to fight secretly in the jungles as part of the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army.
Madam Cheng herself survived the war. In 1957, she attended the opening ceremony of the Kranji War Memorial. She refused to wait for the British Governor to lay down his flowers, and walked in front of him instead, so she could mourn her husband and her fellow soldiers.

Ho Seng Choon - Poultry Farmer
He foresaw the importance of farming in the 1950s and when farmers were still reliant on traditional methods of farming, he pushed to modernise farming. Mr Ho is an industry pioneer and an industry leader. Through his long career as a farmer, he has championed the cause of farmers and worked to share his knowledge and experience with the farming community.
The modernity of Singapore today may have led us to forget that farming was once a major economic activity in rural areas such as Choa Chu Kang, Seletar, Jurong and Punggol. In the late 1950s, local farms were able to meet the needs of the island’s population of 1.6 million people, despite poor soil conditions and traditional farming methods. By the late 1960s, Singapore had 20,000 farms occupying 14,000 hectares.
89-year-old Mr. Ho Seng Choon is a pioneer in Singapore’s poultry sector. Born in Fujian Province in China, Ho moved to Singapore in 1929 where his father ran a provision shop in Chinatown. After World War 2, Ho saw potential in poultry farming and travelled abroad to learn the latest methods in livestock breeding and production.
Through continuous innovation, Seng Choon overcame constraints in land, and raised productivity in poultry farming. Today, the sole proprietorship has grown into a conglomerate with farms in Singapore and Johor and retail lines for battery systems and feed mills, husbandry consultancy and education. Ho’s youngest son has taken over the reins of the business while he enjoys retirement.

Runtik Binti Murtono - Urut Lady
Since moving to Singapore in 1994, Ibu Tutik’s work as an Urut Lady has helped her support her family in Singapore as well as in Surabaya. Demand for her services was particularly high in the Chinese Dragon year of 2012. That year alone, she took care of 600 new mummies. Ibu Tutik enjoys her work and is happy that at 52 years old she is still strong and able to continue working.
In the past, maternity clinics and modern hospitals were hard to come by. Many women thus relied on the skills of a bidan or Malay midwife, who drew upon her knowledge of traditional post-natal rituals to help ease the discomfort of new mothers.
One of the skills wielded by a bidan to restore new mothers to health and shapeliness is urut, or traditional massage techniques. The practice of post-natal jamu massages and benkung has its origins in Indian Ayurvedic traditions, which spread to Southeast Asia via Java. Rarely captured in writing, the art of the bidan was handed down orally from mother to daughter over generations, and each family of healers would maintain their secret techniques and mixes for the poultice of jamu.
To this day, urut remains a popular treatment during the confinement period. One of the leading practitioners of this craft is 53-year-old Madam Runtia Binte Murtono, also known as Ibu Tutik to her clients. She has been massaging and “wrapping” new mothers back to health and shapeliness for more than 35 years. Born in Indonesia to a family of traditional midwives and jamu healers, Ibu Tutik trained under her mother. In 1994 Ibu Tutik came to Singapore, where she began to earn a living as an Urut Lady, making house calls to all corners of the island from her home in Sengkang. She counts mothers of many races amongst her clients.

Thangaraju s/o Singaram - Letter Writer
At 85 years old, Mr. Thangaraju is healthy and spends his days attending to customers at his son-in-law’s shop in Little India to keep himself active. It has been more than 60 years ago when he first arrived in Singapore to look for work; instead he has found a home. His children are Singapore citizens, and enjoyed opportunities for higher education and careers that he himself had sought. Now a grandfather, the story of the Tamil immigrant is one of tenacity and optimism. His positive attitude towards hard work and contributing to those in need of help has helped him build a life and a home in Singapore.
Back when long-distance phone calls were a rare luxury, handwritten letters were the only affordable means of communication between families separated by oceans. Few immigrants could read or write then, so they turned to individuals such as Mr. Thangaraju s/o Singaram to help them craft messages to relatives back home.
Thangaraju, who arrived in Singapore in 1951 from South India, had the rare privilege of formal schooling. Hence, he found himself writing letters for immigrants who shared his quarters in Little India. On weekends or public holidays, Thangaraju would sit over a cup of tea with his clients, mostly older men who did hard labour for a living, and read to them or pen down what they wanted to tell their kinsfolk in Tamil Nadu. His own experience as an immigrant added empathy to his penmanship and Thangaraju would assume the role of mediator and counsellor, softening harsh words and helping to resolve misunderstandings between far-apart spouses or siblings.
By the 1970s however, most older immigrants had passed away or moved back to their homeland, and newer immigrants were usually educated enough to compose their own letters. That spelt the end of Thangaraju’s letter-writing days.

Ng Moey Chye - Samsui Woman
At 81 years old, Ms. Ng does not allow her age to slow her down. She continues to support herself by collecting used cardboard, and once a week she will make her way to the Apex Club of Singapore’s food distribution point to receive a package that includes vegetable and bread. She prefers to see the silver linings in her life and is grateful for her health and the young volunteers for helping the elderly. “Society still has a heart,” she says.
It may be hard to imagine 81-year-old Ms. Ng Moey Chye carting bricks up a construction site. In her younger days, however, Ng would awake at dawn and walk from her quarters at Chinatown to Collyer Quay. There, she would carry out a multitude of tasks that is typically carried out by heavy machinery today at construction sites across Singapore.
Born in Singapore in 1932, Ng was given up for adoption by her parents and never went to school. After witnessing the unhappy marriage of a childhood friend, Ng chose to become a Samsui woman, prizing her independence above everything else.
Samsui women were so-called as the movement originated from the county of Sanshui (Samsui in Cantonese) in Guangdong Province, where women dominated the workforce during a silk industry boom in the mid-19th century. Wearing a distinctive red headscarf or hong toujin (红头巾), the Samsui women were a sisterhood of mainly Cantonese or Hakka women who took a vow of chastity and supported themselves through manual labour.
Hale and hearty even in retirement, Ng now lives in a flat in Redhill and collects used cardboard for sale.

Ang Hao Sai - Poster Painter
He turned his skill to commercial art jobs just as the movie poster painting industry was declining. His ability to seize business opportunities when they came and his courage to adapt to changes have kept Hao Meng Art Studio growing into the second generation.
Ever wondered about the artist behind the lifelike painted posters advertising upcoming blockbusters of the silver screen? Born in Singapore, Mr. Ang Hao Sai was one such artisan whose excellent brushwork created these extravagant works of art. Displaying an early talent for art, Ang left school after Primary 6 to become an apprentice at a poster studio.
Ang eventually became the studio’s master painter, tasked to work on sections requiring fine detail such as the faces of movie characters. At its peak, painters worked in assembly-line shifts producing up to 50 posters each time.
After the studio closed down in the 1980s, Ang launched his own poster painting business in 1987. In keeping with the changing times, Ang also branched out to commercial projects such as signages and props. This plan later expanded into a major business involving the building and painting of stage backdrops. Over time, as the cost of labour rose and new printing technologies became readily available, Ang switched to inkjet printing of photo-real posters as the promotion of new films shifted from large billboards to online platforms. The family business continues to thrive today because of Ang’s foresight and quick adaptation to change. Today, he remains actively involved in his business.

Murugaian s/o Ratnaswami Asari – Goldsmith
He saw the potential of the goldsmith trade and decided to train to become a goldsmith. He worked hard and saved up to start his own goldsmith shop, Indian Jewellers. Although a stroke has affected his movement, the 72-year old has not allowed his condition to slow him down. He started his second shop RMP Jewellers & Goldsmith in 2009, and still remains active in the business.
Mr. Murugaian was just 16 years old when he left South India for Singapore in 1957, to work as an apprentice under a master goldsmith.
Through hard work and determination, Murugaian established RMP Jewellers & Goldsmith located in Little India. The shop is testament of his dedication to a lifetime of traditional jewellery-making - first in the workshops of master goldsmiths and later, at Murugaian’s own premises. In the 1950s, large numbers of Indian goldsmiths arrived in Singapore and turned the area around Buffalo Road into a hub for traditional jewellery. Discerning Chinese ladies as well as Indian families desiring customized jewellery for wedding ceremonies counted amongst their regular customers.
Now too old and frail to make the jewellery himself, Murugaian oversees two craftsmen who create customised necklaces, bracelets, armlets, rings and hair ornaments for long-time customers. Today, RMP Jewellers & Goldsmith is one of the two makers of handcrafted jewellery left in Little India.

The air is thick with the aroma of toasty biscuits, freshly roasted cocoa from chocolate factories, and the occasional waft of chemicals and exhaust.1 Trucks rattle along ferrying local produce such as eggs and bottles of soya sauce.2
You’re in Jurong, Singapore’s primary production hub churning out a slew of products from food to electronics and pharmaceuticals. Getting here — not just your commute, but the journey undertaken by early city planners — was no mean feat. It involved redeveloping swamp land, building factories, roads and amenities from scratch, and of course convincing workers to relocate to the “boondocks”. How did everything fall into place?
Building factories on a crocodile-infested swamp
Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew surveying the swamp that was to become Jurong Industrial Estate. (27 October 1962. Image from the National Archives Singapore)
A remote swamp with crocodile-infested waterways — the last place on anyone’s mind — transformed into a thriving industrial hub. Jurong, one of the most ambitious projects of modern Singapore, was materialised through foresight, determination and ingenuity.
Initiated by Dutch economist Albert Winsemius and Singapore’s minister of finance Goh Keng Swee, the plan to build Jurong Industrial Estate was born out of necessity as a result of Singapore’s high unemployment rate.3
As of 1959, an estimated 200,000 people, or 14% of the population were jobless. With the impending decline of entrepot trade and other economic factors at play, the issue of unemployment was expected to worsen as the population grew.4
Goh's Folly?
Sceptics scoffed at the pair’s plan — few could see rural Jurong’s potential. The project also seemed too costly. Reclamation, infrastructural work and the like would cost a staggering $100 million.5
And while there was a smattering of factories in Jurong, including one which produced canned kaya and curries, Singapore by and large had very little experience in manufacturing.6 In addition, observers felt that investors had little risk appetite to set up shop in Singapore following a spate of labour strikes.
Initial hiccups seemed to prove the sceptics right, as few investors took bait when the estate became ready for production in 1963 after 1.8 million cubic metres of earth had been moved.7 Critics thus named the endeavour ""Goh's Folly"".
Dr Goh persisted with the project anyway. He rolled out a few initiatives to lure investors. These included:
the provision of generous tax incentives;

ready-made factory spaces and infrastructure for companies to launch production;

the promise of a stable labour climate via sound tripartite arrangements.

The Economic Development Board (EDB), established to helm Singapore’s industrialisation drive, courted producers of joss sticks, wigs, garments, fertiliser, plywood, acid and animal feed. Despite their best efforts, the team only managed to secure two investors: NatSteel and Pelican Textiles.

To give his fledgling project a much-needed boost, Goh instructed the EDB to conduct opening ceremonies daily over a three-month period. This was impossible considering that less than 10 factories were ready to start production.8
To populate the calendar, grab news headlines and build hype, the EDB team got creative. It held ceremonies when investors signed agreements to start work in the estate, for groundbreaking ceremonies, as well as official opening ceremonies.
The Economic Development Board was tasked to launch events daily over a three-month period to declare to one and all that Jurong was open for business. (c. 1969. Image from the National Archives Singapore)
The tactic bore fruit, and by the end of the 1960s, 181 factories were in production. The project's success set the stage for subsequent chapters of industrial development in Jurong, with new investors in a wider variety of sectors streaming in steadily.9 Goh's ""Folly"" had become the nation's glory.
By 1969, Jurong Industrial Estate was home to 181 factories and a 20,000-strong workforce. (c.1960s)
Few takers for life in the “wild, wild west”
The path to success was bumpy to say the least, with accounts of Jurong in the early 1960s describing the roads as ""full of pot-holes, some deep enough to swallow a wheel"".10 It was a desolate area, ""hot and dusty"" with no trees or grass, and it was filled with mosquitoes. Workers also bemoaned the lack of recreational activities, save for leisurely walks to Jurong Lake.
To encourage the working community of Jurong to live where they worked, open-air cinemas were constructed while boats, which workers got to use for free on Sundays, were added to the lake.
Dr Goh also “cornered” companies into offering staff a housing allowance to incentivise them to move to Jurong. He would build a tollgate otherwise, he said, where buses and lorries ferrying workers would be charged $50 a month.
These measures were effective. Work on Jurong New Town began in the 1960s11 and by 1969, 16,000 people were living in flats and shophouses built by the Housing Development Board (HDB). The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), a specialised agency formed to develop and manage industrial estates, took over residential and industrial development for a period before the HDB returned in 1982 to handle and oversee the area’s housing needs.
Low-cost flats were erected to attract people to live and work in Jurong. (c.1964. Image from Jurong Town Corporation)
The JTC was behind landmarks such as the diamond blocks of Taman Jurong at Yung Kuang Road where companies rented flats to house staff. The four blocks, completed by JTC in 1973, form a unique diamond footprint and have inner facing common corridors to foster a sense of community.12
Gradually, bus services, wet markets, food centres, clinics, community centres, retail areas, sport facilities, as well as public parks and gardens were added to the mix.
Other landmarks which rose in Jurong include Jurong Town Hall. Perched on a little hill, it served as JTC’s headquarters from 1974 to 2000.13 Now a national monument, the geometrically outstanding building is emblematic of Singapore’s successful industrialisation programme.
Jurong Town Hall, a landmark representing Singapore’s confidence in its industrialisation ambitions. It served as the Jurong Town Corporation’s headquarters for about a quarter of a century.14
By 1980, more than 110,000 people lived in JTC housing units in Taman Jurong, Boon Lay Gardens, Teban Gardens and Pandan Gardens.
The addition of the Chinese Garden at Boon Lay Way added even more life and vibrancy to the district. Designed by Taiwanese architect Yu Yuen-Chen, and built between 1971 and 1975, it comprises bridges, pavilions and a pagoda inspired by classical northern Chinese imperial architecture. It was a popular spot for wedding photography during the 1970s and 1980s.
The Singapore Chinese Garden was commissioned to bolster Jurong’s offerings. (c.1980s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
The Jurong of the future
Jurong’s industrial activities are anchored by clusters such as CapitaLand’s International Business Park and JTC’s Jurong Innovation District which host a diverse and flourishing ecosystem of international and local corporations.15
To spur the country’s next phase of economic transformation, a 360-hectare site in Jurong has been earmarked as Singapore’s next “Central Business District” for sectors such as maritime, energy and IT. Announced in 2017, the Jurong Lake District project will be developed over the next few decades and is expected to generate more than 100,000 jobs.16
The Jurong Lake District is also set to welcome a mini Marina Bay Sands arena which is slated to house hotels, attractions, eateries and shops.

Ahmad Ibrahim (12 May 1916–17 April 1999, Malaysia) was a titan of a lawyer who laid the legal groundwork for Singapore during its formative years. He is credited for drafting the Administration of Muslim Law Act — a landmark piece of legislation which continues to ground the lives and affairs of Muslims in Singapore today. He also spent a good part of his career in academia, shaping young minds, and building up Malaysia’s legal fraternity.
A stellar student
Ahmad Ibrahim was intellectually ambitious from a young age, graduating from prestigious institutions such as Victoria Bridge School, Raffles Institution and Raffles College. In 1936, he was awarded the Queen’s Scholarship to study at Cambridge University, passing the bar exams in London in 1940. While there, Ahmad even picked up the George Long Prize for Roman Law.1
Underlying Ahmad's cerebral gifts was a deep passion for the Malay Muslim community. His father, a medical practitioner active in Islamic social and welfare activities, could have had some bearing on this.2
Upon graduation, Ahmad would work to improve the community's status during the Republic of Singapore’s formative years through activism, scholarly contributions, and his eventual role as a lawmaker. He was called to the bar in Singapore in 1941.
A prolific career
Ahmad rose quickly in the legal scene, despite disruptions in the early days of his career due to World War II. After three years in the civil service as a magistrate then district judge, he chalked up experience in private practice and as a law lecturer, before returning as deputy public prosecutor and senior crown counsel.
In and around 1949, Ahmad drafted the constitution of the Inter-religious Organisation which was established to maintain interfaith harmony. He was also one of its founding members.3 Just a year later, racial and religious riots broke out as a result of the heated Maria/Nadra Hertogh custody battle. In declaring her Islamic marriage illegal, Singapore’s High Court drew the ire of members of the Muslim community.4 Ahmad had represented the man she was married to in a nikah gantung or truncated marriage.5
From 1959 to 1965, Ahmad took his seat as Singapore's first ever state advocate general, having been picked by merit for his intellect.6 He weighed in on critical merger talks with Malaysia.

Upon Singapore’s independence, Ahmad became Singapore’s first attorney-general. His legal mind was tapped by the law fraternity and government on a range of legal issues in administrative, property, finance and contract law. He was also involved in the drafting of the Women’s Charter, Intestate Succession Act, and other statutes that serve as the basis for Singapore’s legal system today.7
All this while, Ahmad, eager to improve the legal status of his community, studied Malay Muslim law avidly. He delved into the archives and produced extensive research on the legal history of Muslims in Southeast Asia, examining and comparing how Muslim law was administered historically in Malay states and in other countries in the region where it was not traditionally in practice.8
With such a depth of knowledge, Ahmad was the best man to formulate and draft the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) for Singapore — a task he poured his heart into. In advocating for Muslim laws to be folded into Singapore’s legal framework, he valued and respected convention. However, he refused to allow tradition to get in the way of progress for the community. As such, he kept a keen eye on issues of equality as well as the protection of the vulnerable.
AMLA, which came into effect in 1968, deals with marriage and divorce matters, and also led to the establishment of Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). Muis, the Islamic religious council, guides the Muslim community and administers zakat (tithe), wakaf (endowment), pilgrimage affairs and the like.

AMLA stands as a piece of outstanding, landmark legislation given that Singapore is the only former British colony with a minority Muslim population to have such a law, and the only one with an Islamic religious council integrated within the state’s legal structure.
Attesting to Ahmad’s legal prowess, pioneer leader Goh Keng Swee described him as a man of “tremendous breadth and depth of intellect, whose ability as a legal draftsman is unsurpassed in this country"".9
Powerhouse of a professor
The last chapter of Ahmad's career was spent in academia. He moved to Malaysia and helped establish the country’s first law faculty at the University of Malaya in 1972.
Not one to rest on his laurels, Ahmad moved around the country meeting leaders and administrators of Muslim law to keep abreast of issues. In his golden years, he continued to be in demand and worked the international conferences’ and seminars’ circuit.
He passed away from a heart attack in Malaysia on 17 April 1999 but his legacy lives on in the academic and legal papers — of which there are more than 200 — he wrote, as well as the laws he shaped.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/lest-we-forget/why-we-mark-wwii-each-year,"What’s Up, Singapore’s newspaper for students, spoke to Education Minister (Schools) Ng Chee Meng in 2018 about the importance of observing the anniversary of World War II.
What’s Up: Unlike previous Education Ministers, you were born after independence, in 1968 — long after World War II. Did your parents or grandparents shared with you their personal stories of the Battle of Singapore and the Japanese Occupation?
Mr Ng: I remember my mum talking about the hardships of war. My grandfather went into hiding during Operation Sook Ching (a Japanese military operation where Chinese in Singapore were massacred). During this time, Chinese men between the ages of 18 and 50 were called to screening centres and executed. I never met my grandfather, but I heard about his experience through my mother.

My mother also talked about the hardships of day to day life. Most meals were made up of tapioca. Eating an egg was a luxury. Most significantly, she was very sad and lamented that she had missed out on the opportunity of getting an education. To support her family, she started working as a seamstress from a young age.

These stories left a deep impression on me. They had an impact for life. They made me realise the importance of Total Defence to keep Singapore safe. I heard these stories from my mother, and now it is our turn to share these stories with our children, so they, too, can understand the importance of keeping Singapore safe.

Singapore is safe today, but we cannot take peace for granted. We have peace in Singapore because we put a lot of effort into making that happen.
Ng Chee Meng was a general in the Singapore Armed Forces before he joined the government in 2015.

What’s Up: You once led the Singapore Armed Forces as its Chief of Defence Force. Do you think Singapore is better able to defend itself now than in 1942?
Mr Ng: Absolutely. Firstly, we have better weapons. Most importantly, Singaporeans have the will to keep Singapore safe.

In 1942, we were not the most important piece in the British Empire’s war strategy. “Fortress” Singapore was given second-rate weapons to defend itself. But when we became a nation-state, we made thea promise to stand up for ourselves. We decided to get better weapons and also train our sons, young Singaporeans,to protect ourselves. This has made all the difference.Standing up for ourselves is worth celebrating. This year, we mark 50 years of National Service.
It is terrible when one can’t defend oneself and everything that matters to you. A war puts everything we love in danger —– brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and, friends. You may be hearing or reading about what is happening in Iraq or to the children in Syria. We are happy that our neighbourhood is relatively peaceful. But we should never take peace for granted. We should always be prepared for the worst war - but always remember that our main aim is to keep peace.
What’s Up: You’ve had several roles in the armed forces, most notably as an air force pilot. How best can the importance of defending Singapore be conveyed to those who may not serve National Service (such as women for instance) or work in the military?
Mr Ng: There are many ways to contribute to a stronger Singapore. There are five aspects to Total Defence. You can play a part in making sure that Singaporeans of all races get along and are kind and understanding toof one another; you can contribute to the country’s economy so that we can do well together...… there are many ways for all of us to contribute to Singapore.
In fact I believe that a stronghold of society are our mothers. They strengthen the family, build relationships in communities, and nurture the young —– these are all components of Total Defence.

Defence is not the domain of men alone. Our daughters will stand up for Singapore, and some have also chosen the military path.
What’s Up: Singapore has changed so much since 1942. It is hard to imagine what it must have looked like during the Battle for Singapore. Is there any historic site which exists today that you think is the reminiscent of this period?
Mr Ng: The Former Ford Factory in Bukit Timah is one such building. This is where the British forces surrendered to the Japanese after the Battle for Singapore. But if I had to choose, I would choose Sentosa.

Sentosa was a military base during the Second World War, but the guns were facing south because the British expected the Japanese to invade from that direction. The Japanese took them by surprise when they entered from the north-western coastline. It’s a good starting place to understand what went wrong with the British war strategy.

Sentosa was also a prisoner of war camp. During Operation Sook Ching, which I mentioned earlier, Chinese men suspected of being anti-Japanese were killed on its beach. There are many poignant lessons to be learnt here. To me it is a reminder of how important it is for Singaporeans to be at the top of our game, and to take Total Defence seriously, not just at war times, but in times of peace to ensure war never dawn upon Singapore.

World War Two came to Singapore when the first bombs were dropped on the island on 8 December 1941.1 61 people were killed and 133 others injured that day.2 This was followed by a swift Japanese invasion from the north two months later.3 Local forces and the British military were completely overwhelmed by the Japanese army and surrendered after just one week.4 Singapore was renamed Syonan-To, or Light of the South, during an occupation which lasted for three years and seven months.5

The end of an era
On Monday, 8 December 1941, the first bombs were dropped on Singapore. The flames of war had been raging across Europe and China, but the battle had not been expected to reach the island at the time. The British colony was touted as an impregnable fortress, so there was a confidence that even if attacked, it would not be overwhelmed.6
The events of that day shattered Singapore's air of confidence. Meanwhile, aware of the weak defences on the northern border, the Japanese planned an invasion from Johor, and the first soldiers set foot on the shores of Singapore exactly two months later, on 8 February 1942.7
The Battle for Singapore had begun. 
A ruthless and swift invasion
The first Japanese troops crossed the narrow Johor Strait on assault boats and barges, entering Singapore under the cover of darkness. The 22nd Australian Brigade guarding the northern coastline was overwhelmed in just two hours.8
The Japanese swiftly repaired the bombed causeway to provide troops with another point of entry into Singapore. (Image from National Archives of Singapore)
""When you encounter the enemy after landing, think of yourself as an avenger coming face to face at last with his father’s murderer. Here is a man whose death will lighten your heart.""
– Excerpt from a manual issued to Japanese troops in Southeast Asia.9
With ruthless determination, the Japanese then moved swiftly to capture Bukit Timah's petrol, oil, and supply depots from the Allies on 11 February 1942. The Ford Factory was turned into the headquarters of the commander of the Japanese 25th Army in Southeast Asia, General Tomoyuki Yamashita.10
Opium Hill – Singapore’s last line of defence
With Bukit Timah taken, allied troops were ordered to withdraw to the defensive perimeter along the city area, stretching from Pasir Panjang to Kallang. Among them were Lieutenant Adnan Saidi and the men of the “C” Company, 1st Malay Brigade, who put up the fierce fight in what became known as the Battle of Opium Hill.11

–Lt Adnan Saidi, 1st Malay Brigade, Battle of Opium Hill12

Forced to retreat to Bukit Chandu from Pasir Panjang Ridge with a platoon of only 42 soldiers,13 Lt Adnan and his men were heavily outnumbered. At one point during the battle, they  foiled an infiltration attempt by the Japanese, who were wearing captured British Army uniforms, by recognising that they were marching in a line of four columns, not the usual three columns typical of British troops. As the fighting dragged on and with ammunition ran running out, the men of ""C"" company engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. They were eventually overwhelmed but refused to surrender. Their commitment enraged the Japanese, who reportedly hung Lt Adnan upside down on a tree and stabbed him to death.14
After taking Bukit Chandu,15 the Japanese troops moved further inland, eventually reaching the British Military Hospital (now Alexandra Hospital). Despite being offered peaceful intent by a British officer, the Japanese soldiers rounded up about 260 staff and patients, and massacred them the next morning.16 After a discussion with his commanders at the Fort Canning Bunker (Battle Box), Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, the commanding officer of the British Commonwealth Forces in Malaya, officially surrendered Singapore to the Japanese at the Ford Factory. The date was 15 February 1942, just one week after the first Japanese troops landed in Singapore,17

Syonan‐To — Light of the South18
In contrast to the name given to Singapore by the Japanese occupation, it was a dark three years and seven months19 for many on the island. The Sook Ching Massacre saw people suspected of being anti-Japanese executed along the beaches of Punggol, Changi, Katong, Tanah Merah and Blakang Mati (now Sentosa Island). Massacres were said to have also occured at Hougang, Thomson Road, Changi Road, Siglap, Bedok and East Coast. Due to a lack of written records, the exact number of people killed in the operation is unknown. The official figure given by the Japanese is 5,000, although the actual number is believed to much higher.20

Aside from the constant fear of persecution by the Kempeitai (Japanese military police),21 many living in Singapore during the occupation had to survive on limited food rations. The Japanese issued a new local currency, informally known as ‘banana money’, but hyperinflation caused its value to drop drastically, so that eventually almost nothing could be purchased with it.22 
Prisoners-of-war (POWs) were forced into hard labour and being imprisoned in cramped cells ridden with disease. They were also made to sign a pledge of non-escape, after four prisoners attempted to flee from Selarang camp. This was a violation of the Geneva Convention, which gave POWs the right to escape.23

Back to the Union Jack
As World War Two dragged on, the Japanese began to suffer numerous defeats in other parts of the world.24 Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Soviet Union’s declaration of war in August, Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945, in Tokyo Bay on the American battleship USS Missouri, bringing an end to the war and their occupation of Singapore.25

Two days later in Singapore, General Seishiro Itagaki signed the instrument of surrender on board the British cruiser HMS Sussex in Keppel Harbour. On 12 September 1945, General Itagaki, accompanied by four other generals and two admirals26, signed 11 copies of the surrender documents at the Municipal Building (now known as the Former City Hall)27 to officially return Singapore to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the British Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia.28 12 September was celebrated as “Victory Day” for the rest of the colonial era in Singapore,29 closing the chapter on one of the darkest periods in Singapore's history.

Commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore, photographer Nicky Loh meets four survivors who have lived through the trying times of the war, and captures vignettes of their stories.
Written and photographed by Nicky Loh
I was commissioned by the National Heritage Board to create a photo essay of World War II (WWII) survivors to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore.
My pitch to them was to shine a light on the wrinkled faces of these amazing people through tight portraits on a red background. The red was meant to symbolise self-sacrifice and also serve as a metaphor for Singapore. I wanted pensive, stark and strong portraits to do the talking. My pre-conceived narrative had a more sombre tone, where the survivors reflected on their experiences during the war. It was not until I met the first subject for the photo shoot, did I realise that my direction was totally wrong.
When you find yourself in a situation way beyond your control, all you can do is to follow the instinct to survive. Perhaps after a horrible ordeal, do you then realise how precious life is, and you try to live the rest of your life in the most fruitful and meaningful way.
When we arrived for the photoshoot and video interview with Mr Joseph Conceicao, 92, a former Singapore ambassador and Member of Parliament, at his apartment in Marine Parade, he sternly asked one of the crew, ""Tell me young man, why is your hair golden?"" Everyone froze awkwardly for about two seconds before Mr Conceicao broke into a hearty laugh and said, “It’s okay young man. It looks good!” Age was evident, but the fire in his heart was still burning bright.
We were then invited into his apartment, which had a hearty collection of antiques and photographs collected from around the world, all displayed and labelled meticulously on his glass shelves. Without a doubt, he had travelled extensively throughout his life after the war.
""Call me Joe, young man,"" he said to me.
Mr Joseph Conceicao, 92, a former Singapore ambassador and Member of Parliament was about 17 in 1941 when the Japan bombings started in Singapore.
Mr Conceicao was a young man of around 17 years old in 1941 when the Japanese started bombing Singapore. His memory was still as sharp as ever as he recounted an incident with his cousin after the Japanese heavily bombed the Orchard and Newton areas to cut off communications:
""My cousin and I were curious and wanted to see the aftermath, so we walked across a field near our house towards a junction in the Newton Circus area. Suddenly I heard him gasping and I turned around to see what had happened. We saw hands, heads maybe, legs, and parts of the human body lying about. That affected him throughout the course of the war and his life.""
When Mr Conceicao's family eventually concluded that their home was too dangerous to continue living in due to the proximity of the bombings, they relocated to the basement of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC) building on Battery Road.
""While walking there with our belongings, we saw British soldiers who were taking off their military uniforms. Fleeing. To our shock, when we arrived at the Hong Kong Bank, there were more British soldiers sprawled across the place when they should be out there fighting. This gave us a terrible impression of them. Sir Shenton Thomas (then Governor of Singapore) said that Singapore must not fall, it shall not fall, but the next day it fell.""
Singapore fell on February 15, 1942.
Ms Mary Magdeline Pereira, 75, was born that year inside the Tiong Bahru air raid shelter – tragically one day after her father was called for duty and perished.
""My father was activated for duty on January 21, 1942, and he told my mother, ""I don't know if I'll return."" True to his words, that was the day that Singapore had the worst casualty from the Japanese bombing. Many people died. I heard my father was carrying the injured when shrapnel hit him on his chest and on his face. That was how the war began for me - with the loss of my father just a day before I was born.
That very night, an air raid occurred and her family had to seek refuge inside the shelter located at Block 78, Guan Chuan Street. Inside, Ms Pereira's mother went into labour under the care of Professor J. S. English, Singapore's first professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, who was in charge of the medical unit in the shelter. With help from him and his wife, Mrs Pereira delivered her daughter just after midnight on January 22, 1942.
Ms Mary Magdeline Pereira, 75, was born the year Singapore fell, January 22, 1942, inside the Tiong Bahru air raid shelter. This was just one day after her father was called for duty and perished.
As I photographed her at the entrance of the very shelter she was born in, she told me, ""I think the war was a period where I grew up carefree and wild. I had so much independence and that is what gives me so much resilience to overcome all odds. I went through quite a tough time but I viewed it as an obstacle to overcome. When I could not get my teaching post in Singapore, I went to the United Kingdom to be a barrister at the age of 55. So don't tell me there isn't a time to learn.
""WWII has brought out one class of people, a generation that has resilience and has been able to overcome all odds. That was actually the good part of the war,"" added Ms Pereira.
It is a cold hard fact to confront but within the next two decades, there will be very few survivors of the Japanese Occupation around to tell the incredible personal stories that can seem straight out of a movie.
My first impression of Mrs Helen Joseph, 88, was that she is a very sweet lady who constantly has a smile on her face. Her demeanour reminded me of Betty White of the 1980s American sitcom, Golden Girls. Her home has a grand clock that rings a soothing chime every 15 minutes - a chime that sticks with me even till today. I thought, ""How could someone as nice as her go through something as terrible as the war?""
Mrs Helen Joseph, 88, was just 12 when the Japanese Occupation began. During this period, Helen stayed with her uncle and relatives in the Government Quarters along Rowell Road in Little India.
Mrs Joseph was just around 12 when the Japanese Occupation began.
""They took Chinese people by the lorries including my neighbour's husband,"" Mrs Joseph recalled. ""We then heard rumours that the Japanese had dug a hole in the Padang, laid out the Chinese men and shot them with machine guns. One by one, the men fell into the hole. One pretended that he was dead and waited till it was all quiet and then he ran away to tell everybody of the massacre. My neighbour never saw her husband again.""
It was known that the Japanese military committed numerous atrocities against civilians, especially the Chinese. During the Japanese Occupation, they introduced the system of ""Sook Ching"", which means ""purge through purification"" to get rid of civilians deemed to be anti-Japanese. The massacre is believed to have claimed the lives of around 20,000 ethnic Chinese in Singapore.
Mrs Joseph stayed with her uncle and relatives in Government Quarters along Rowell Road in Little India. Yet even during times of hardship, Mrs Joseph remembers the true communal spirit with many of her neighbours.
""It didn't matter if you were Chinese, Indian, Malay or Eurasian like me, everyone helped one another because we needed to. We had to queue up for food rations at 3am in the morning. Even so, when it came to our turn, the food would have run out and the person in charge would tell us to go away. Thankfully neighbours who had queued earlier would also share what they had with us.""
Feisty and seemingly fearless, Mrs Joseph also harboured secrets of the Japanese Occupation.
""The [prisoner of war] camps were near our place and we could see inside. The British soldiers were so skinny, all ribs. My sister and I would secretly pack some bread given by the Japanese into a bundle and leave them near the barbed wire fences and shout ""Johnny, Johnny!"" The next day the bundles would be gone.""
""Who is Johnny?"" I asked.
""We didn't know their names so we called them all Johnny!"" laughed Mrs Joseph.
I arrived earlier than the rest of the crew at Mr William Gwee's place in Lothian Terrace near Siglap and saw him reversing his car into the front porch of his house. Yes! At the age of 82, Mr Gwee is still actively driving, though he murmured to me that young drivers nowadays are reckless. The gate of the house has a beautiful flower structure that grows above it, making it look like a Tim Burton film set.
Students and researchers of Peranakan and Straits Chinese studies will no doubt be familiar with Mr Gwee, a fifth-generation Singapore Baba. Mr Gwee and his son, Andy, are prolific collectors and this was evident as soon as I stepped into the house. Mr Gwee probably has the largest collection of Baba Malay books in the world, and also collects memorabilia and artifacts pertaining to WWII, medicine and porcelain.
Mr William Gwee, 82, then eight years old, was about to start Primary 2 at his school when the war started.
Mr Gwee showed me into his study, which was indeed a treasure trove of the past, including hundreds of folders of newspaper cuttings, documents and letters, all purposefully organised by themes and topics.
When war reached Southeast Asia, Mr Gwee, then eight years old, was about to start Primary 2 at his school.
""I must say that the experiences I went through growing up during the three and a half years of the Japanese Occupation helped provide me with an accelerated maturity.""
The day Singapore became Syonan-To, the name given to the island by the Japanese during the Occupation, is still vivid to Mr Gwee.
""During the bombing days, before the surrender, my family took shelter at 97 Devonshire Road at my grand-aunt’s house where we could see the Cathay Cinema. It was the tallest high-rise building in Singapore back then. Every day I saw the Union Jack of the British flag, fluttering high up on a pole on top of the building.""
""On that day, during the fall of Singapore, I was probably the first to realise that Singapore was about to change because when I looked out of the window at the building, I saw a different flag. It was a white flag with a red circle in the centre. So I shouted excitedly to the rest about the strange-looking flag above Cathay Cinema and my father came out and exclaimed, ""Sudah habis!"" The two words literally translate to,""We are finished.""
Three or four days after the surrender, the Japanese chased Mr Gwee and his family out of the house and they took shelter near his father's friend's home near the Sultan Mosque after much wandering around. ""When we walked on the streets we found out that thousands of people were also on the streets without a home. All of them were carrying bundles of food, clothing, bags and suitcases as if they were travelling. I was given small bundles to carry but after a long walk the bundles became quite heavy.""
After a long refuge at Mr Gwee's father's friend's house after the fall of Singapore, the streets were watched by Japanese soldiers.
""We wanted to return home but there was a Japanese sentry post on the road who arrested all the men that went past. Against the advice of his good friend, my father brought us to a table at the post and shouted some Japanese words and showed some pictures of him and his former bosses."" Mr Gwee's father had been under the employment of a Japanese company before the war started.
""This aroused the curiosity of the Japanese officers and soldiers, which I supposed save our lives because after that, the Japanese soldiers stamped something on each of our arms and shouted at us to move on.""
As Mr Gwee and his family walked home to Devonshire Road, he noticed that there were only women on the road, and he wondered why his father - a man - was allowed to roam the streets with his family unscathed. Many women they encountered along the way asked Mr Gwee's father what had happened to their loved ones. He could not answer. It was only after the war did everybody learn that most of the young men in Singapore were massacred and never came back.
Mr Gwee reminisced, ""75 years later, whenever I meet people who have been through the war, I ask them whether they had lost anybody during that period now known as 'Sook Ching'. I have not come across anybody who said no. Every one of them had lost somebody.""
""After Japan surrendered, the actual handing over of Singapore from the Japanese to the British took place in mid-September 1945. It was a big affair for the Singaporeans because of the sufferings they had to endure for three and a half years. It was time to see an end to their ordeal. So they came in the thousands and waited at the Padang opposite the City Hall building. When the Japanese came to surrender and marched up the steps of City Hall led by General Seishiro Itagaki, the people booed at the Japanese knowing that this time they could get away with it,"" added Mr Gwee.
""It was not until a few days later that Singaporeans had another interesting sight. They (the British) made the Japanese soldiers dig up the ground in front of City Hall to fill up other holes in front of the building. A huge crowd was watching the Japanese having to work for us for the first time. You saw nothing but smiling faces. Excitement. Sparkles in their eyes. Knowing that the worst was over.""
Perhaps everything does happen for a reason. These were ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances - caught in a dreadful war that led to the eventual independence of Singapore, a home to many of us now. Fate must have played a part, but let us not forget that our nation was also built upon a generation of people who endured a time we cannot imagine today. We therefore honour them by remembering their stories.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/roosters-of-the-national-collection/story,"Whether it’s a pair of delicate traditional slippers or a vessel from the 15th Century, the National Collection has many special artefacts that feature this year’s zodiac animal - the Rooster. Let's take a closer look at some of these pieces.
Red Junglefowl from the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings
Gift of Mr. G. K. Goh.
This plate shows a regal-looking pair of red junglefowl, which in its feral form has now become the most numerous bird in the world. The short, distinctive call of the wild rooster (the bird shown on the left of the drawing) can still be heard from the forest at dawn in some remote parts of Malaysia.
The Malay name, ayam hutan, means ""forest chicken"", and this species is, in fact, the ancestor of the domesticated chicken. You can still find the original form of the red junglefowl in forests in Malaysia and Pulau Ubin, Singapore, although frequent crossbreeding with domestic stock is weakening the wild species.
Embroidered Spectacle Case
This embroidered spectacle case from the Asian Civilisations Museum is made from velvet. The colourful floral motifs and that of a rooster are created from coloured silk thread using the raised satin stitch. This is a technique where flat stitches are used to cover an area of the fabric. Metallic thread couching is used to create a border of decorative patterns along the edges of this piece. These ‘duan nipah’ cases were flattened pouches with double layered cases. They consist of a slightly larger outer case which serves as the cover, made to slip snugly over the inner case or container.
A pair of Kasut Manek featuring Rooster Motifs
This pair of “Kasut Manek” or ""beaded shoes"" comes from the collection of The Peranakan Museum. The slipper face is covered with bead embroidery or threading. This is a technique where coloured seed beads are stitched onto a base fabric using needle and thread. More specifically, the technique of embroidery used is the petit point beadwork, in which the needle worker uses coloured beads to stitch out patterns drawn onto square paper. Such bead embroidery was usually done on velvet or plain weave cotton and required the use of a frame or ‘pidangan’. The main motif on this piece is a rooster against an a green background with floral motifs. These slippers were traditionally worn with the “sarong kebaya” (blouse and skirt cloth) or the “baju panjang” (long tunic).
Woodblock print, Chinese New Year (Rooster)
This woodblock print from the Asian Civilisations Museum belongs to a set of five made by woodblock water colour printing process. The motifs in these prints include baby boys, bird, phoenix and flowers. This one shows an image of a rooster. They are all popular themes that convey good wishes, and are generally decorated on the front doors of ordinary Chinese homes, to usher in the New Year in an auspicious way.
Chicken-shaped kendi
This kendi from the Asian Civilisations Museum originated from northern Vietnam between the 15th and 16th Centuries. A kendi is a special type of vessel that was found in many parts of Asia. They were often made in different shapes and forms.
Here, the chicken-shaped kendi was probably moulded in two parts before the vase was attached to the back of the bird separately, to provide as a mouthpiece. The details of the rooster, such as its tail plumes and facial features, were painted in blue before the piece was fired.
Every artefact in the National Collection has a story to tell, and these five offer just a small glimpse into the depth of artistry and history on display. Now, isn’t that something to crow about?

MuseSG Volume 10 Issue 2 - 2017
Encountering the sheer number of people at Tampines today can sometimes leave one overwhelmed. From its multiple shopping malls and offices to Our Tampines Hub, the estate’s newest community and lifestyle destination, Tampines is often crowded with throngs of people going about their daily routines. According to a 2016 survey by the Department of Statistics, Singapore, Tampines was home to around 250,000 residents and was the third most populous residential town in Singapore after Bedok and Jurong West at the time. It is evident from the loads of passengers constantly spilling out from Tampines Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Station that Tampines is a town bustling with activity.
Yet, long-time residents who have lived in Tampines since the town was built in the 1980s recall a different picture of the area. Anwar Bin Haji Mawardee, who first moved into Tampines in 1985, remembers it as a desolate and empty new town: “At that time there weren’t as many flats [as there are today]. It wasn’t as crowded as it is now... When we met our friends from other parts of the island, they would say, ‘Wah you live in Tampines, you ulu type ah.’”
Clarice Teoh, another resident who moved into the town in the early 1980s, echoes similar sentiments: “When we selected a at here, we were a bit hesitant. It was a bit like an ‘end of the earth’ feeling. Bedok was popular, and it was already built up, and most people didn’t think beyond Bedok in the east.”
Before the MRT line extended into Tampines, residents had to alight at Tanah Merah to take a feeder bus. There was also no proper bus interchange, save for a makeshift interchange along Tampines Avenue 5.
Tampines resident, Wendy Oh, recalls that the streets were barely lit at night: “When we moved here during the early 1980s, it was very remote and really dark at night. You wouldn’t dare to go out at night as there were no street lights, and many of the HDB blocks were still under construction. I recalled asking myself then, why did I move to such an ulu area with no amenities?”

These experiences of living in Tampines Town in its nascent years seem to mirror that of village life in the district before the 1980s. Ulu, which means “remote” in Malay, was a term often used to de ne Tampines even before the residential town was built. Due to the fact that until the 1970s, old Tampines Road was the only thoroughfare that traversed across north-eastern Singapore towards Changi, the district was relatively isolated from other parts of the island.

Tampines Road began in 1847 as a bridle path accommodating horses and pedestrians. The road spanned from the 6th milestone of Serangoon Road to Changi Road near the eastern tip of Singapore. Many early kampong (village) dwellers settled along this road, and some of the villages here included Kampong Teban, Teck Hock Village, Hun Yeang Village and Kampong Tampines.

Travelling into and out of the district was often a challenge for the villagers living in Tampines. Back then, bus services from town terminated at the 6th milestone of Serangoon Road (known as Kovan today), and commuters had to continue their journey into Tampines on pirate taxis and privately-owned buses.

Yvonne Siow, a former teacher at Tampines Primary School in the 1960s, recalls: “[The drivers] would wait to get as many people into their taxis as possible and not all the pirate taxis would... travel deep into the kampong, as they would have trouble finding a customer on the way back. So some people resorted to hitching a ride from cars or lorries going in.”
The area was so withdrawn that even in the late 1970s, when other parts of Singapore were being modernised, smaller streets located further down from Tampines Road remained unknown and difficult to locate. Jimmy Ong, who formerly lived in a Tampines kampong, shares: “We could give visitors our address, but there was no way to tell them exactly where we stayed. What usually happened was that we would go out to the [nearby] school to wait for them and bring them in.”
From the 1960s to the 1980s, Tampines was also associated with the sand quarrying and waste disposal industry, which not only damaged the surrounding environment, but also made living there an unpleasant experience. Sand from Tampines was used for the building of Housing & Development Board (HDB) towns in the 1960s, and demand for the material was so high that at its peak, there were 26 sand quarries operating in Tampines.

Quarrying left gaping holes in the ground, and runoff from the quarries often resulted in floods and choked drains. In addition, the nearby Lorong Halus landfill, sometimes referred to as the “Tampines dumping ground”, emitted foul stenches that could reach as far as MacPherson on the occasions when its garbage mounds – as tall as 10 storeys – caught fire.

Nevertheless, despite these inconveniences, former kampong dwellers also fondly reminisce about the close-knit relationships fostered with their neighbours and friends, as well as the community-centric spirit that was part of daily life.
Florence Neo, who grew up near Hun Yeang Village, elaborates: “To me, kampong spirit means that whenever there is a need, everybody chips in to help. When my mum gave birth to me and my siblings, her neighbours came over and taught her what to cook and advised her what to eat.”
Villagers also bonded over simple entertainment such as catching insects or watching wayang (“street opera” in Malay) shows that were organised by the Chinese temples in the vicinity. Albert Peh, who lived in Kampong Teban, remembers the large crowds of villagers who would gather at the Tua Pek Kong temple during a wayang show. He shares: “For us kids, we were most excited by the pushcarts that came with food, sweets and flavoured ice balls. There were also tikam tikam (“games of chance” in Malay) stalls, some with roulette wheels, [where] you could win toys or money.”

These images described by former kampong villagers and early residents of Tampines Town are a stark contrast to the modern and bustling residential town we see today. It was highly unlikely that anyone living here in the 1980s could imagine that Tampines would receive the World Habitat Award from the Building and Social Housing Foundation and UN-Habitat just a decade later in 1991, even beating out contending entries from Vancouver, Canada and Boston, USA. Overnight, Tampines Town became recognised as an exemplar of “high-quality, high-density and affordable housing”, and was touted as a model that cities around the world could replicate.

The award was a historic moment for Singapore as the achievements of the country’s public housing were finally being recognised on an international level. By the time HDB started designing Tampines Town in the 1970s, Singapore’s post-war housing shortage had been largely resolved, allowing the Board to channel its resources into improving its town planning models.
The award was an affirmation of the many town planning innovations that the HDB pioneered in Tampines, which sought to foster community bonds and encourage neighbourly interaction. The innovations included the introduction of integrated green corridors – a precursor to today’s ubiquitous park connectors, as well as the precinct concept, which brought amenities closer to residents and encouraged greater social interaction between residents from different socio-economic backgrounds.
The HDB also sought to capture the unique identity and heritage of Tampines in its architecture. HDB architect Lee-Loy Kwee Wah wanted to reflect the fruit farms of rural Tampines in her designs of the town’s public playgrounds. After briefly experimenting with different fruit designs (including a durian playground that was later deemed too risky due to the fruit’s spikes), she produced three playgrounds that were installed in Tampines: the watermelon, mangosteen and pineapple playgrounds. The former two playgrounds can still be found in Tampines Central Park, and have become iconic symbols of Tampines.

Other town planning innovations included blocks of varied designs and heights, open spaces for communal activities, and a well-integrated transport network system consisting of the MRT and Pan- Island Expressway.
In 1991, the town entered yet another phase of its development when it was designated Singapore’s first Regional Centre, a concept spearheaded by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to grow commercial centres in suburban areas. Major corporations soon established themselves in Tampines, including the former Pavilion Cineplex and DBS Tampines Centre, which housed Japanese retailer Sogo.

The concept also paved the way for the construction of large shopping malls in Tampines, starting with Century Square in 1995 and Tampines Mall the following year.

For the generation that grew up in Tampines in the 1990s, these malls were the setting for many outings with friends and families.
Former Tampines resident Bryne Leong shares: “[I remember going to] Pavilion and watching Disney movies and Titanic. There was a Burger King downstairs where a schoolmate and I would share a meal and fight over French fries.”
Although Pavilion and Tampines Centre have since been demolished, Tampines Mall, Century Square and the town’s latest shopping mall, Tampines One, have taken over as popular hangouts for Tampines residents.
As the town gradually matured, stories of ulu kampongs and a dark, desolate town also began to fade into history. Nevertheless, aspects of Tampines’ heritage can still be found at some sites today, especially in its religious institutions.
For example, hidden inside the grand Tampines Chinese Temple at Tampines Street 21 is a temple plaque that dates to 1851. The plaque belongs to the Soon Hin Ancient Temple, a Taoist village temple that was first set up in an attap hut at Jalan Ang Siang Kong at the 11th milestone of Tampines Road. Similarly, Masjid Darul Ghufran at Tampines Avenue 5, had its origins in the multiple surau (“prayer houses” in Malay) which served Muslim villagers in the east. These surau raised funds for the building of the mosque, which was completed in 1990.

Finally, while almost all of Tampines’ former quarries have been filled in, two quarry pits still remain – one has been converted into Bedok Reservoir, while another lies abandoned and hidden behind a row of trees along Tampines Avenue 10.
TAMPINES HERITAGE TRAIL
Many of the heritage sites in Tampines can be explored through the Tampines Heritage Trail that was launched in September 2017. It chronicles the history of Tampines from the 19th century to the present day, piecing a layered narrative of the town through archival records, social memories, photographs and maps.
Trail goers can embark on any of the three specially curated thematic short trails that explore different aspects of Tampines’ heritage. The Tampines Town Trail explores some of the town planning innovations and sites of everyday heritage in the town; the Religious Institutions Trail explores the diverse houses of faith found in the area and highlights its unique architecture and practices; and the Green Spaces Trail is NHB’s first cycling trail, taking cyclists to heritage and scenic locales in Tampines, including former kampong locations, and a former landfill turned wetland.
The launch of Tampines Heritage Trail follows the August 2017 opening of Our Tampines Gallery, a gallery that showcases the heritage of Tampines with a focus on community-contributed stories and collections. Our Tampines Gallery is located within the Tampines Regional Library at Our Tampines Hub, the first integrated community and lifestyle hub in Singapore. Presented by NHB, the gallery is developed together with the community, and aims to make heritage more accessible and inclusive for everyone. Its inaugural exhibition is titled Tampines: A History, and presents an overview of the history of Tampines through maps, photographs and objects.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/kopi-talk-with-our-clans-and-associations/story,"Ever wondered what clans and associations in Singapore do? Well, we sure did, and here are some insights into our afternoon chats over kopi with these champions of Chinese heritage and culture.
Residing in the colourful shophouses along Chinatown, many are aware of the existence of clans and associations, but our understanding of them is often less clear.
A common one would be that they have ties to secret societies, according to Jack Tan, the 56-year-old Vice Secretary of the Chin Woo Athletic Association. However, he clarifies, the association conducts a careful screening of their members for links with secret society gangs as well as criminal activity, so that's one myth debunked.
Another is the belief that members of clans and associations comprise the elderly, and all they do is gather to chat and drink tea. Well, you may actually see members chatting over tea, but it is certainly not all they do.
While their day-to-day operations may not be the most glamorous, these clans and associations are culturally significant. Each representing a different cultural aspect of the Chinese community in Singapore, they play an integral role in preserving an important piece of our history.
Preserving Nanyin
Founded in 1941, Siong Leng Musical Association aims to promote and preserve traditional Nanyin music and Liyuan opera in Singapore. But what exactly is Nanyin music? Loosely translated, it means ""music from the South"", where the province of Fujian is in China.
Project Manager of Siong Leng, Seow Ming Xian, 23, explains, ""Nanyin music originates from Fujian. The masters write books, articles, research papers and songs about Nanyin, but there are no documents in English that we can show to the English speaking community.""
Seow Ming Xian, Project Manager of Siong Leng (left), with fellow members.
Hence, to bring its art to the uninitiated, Siong Leng performs annually at various places such as Thian Hock Keng and Kusu Island. The association also stages major productions locally and participates in music festivals overseas, gaining international recognition for its art forms.
Besides its yearly heritage performances and artistic productions, perhaps Siong Leng’s most important work resides in the translating and digitally archiving of Nanyin documents from the masters in the Fujian province of China. These documents mostly exist as physical copies, and the association is working on a cloud archival system to make these resources more accessible and available to everyone.
Are You a Li?
A traditional surname clan, Kwong Wai Siew Li Si She Shut takes in only members of the Li clan and family, as opposed to cultural clans and associations where membership is open to anyone.
While Kwong Wai Siew Li Si She Shut was initially set up 140 years ago to help the Li immigrants from China find jobs, housing, and to provide them with a place of shelter, that role has obviously ceased over time.
Lee Wai Ching (bottom right) with other clan members
The clan now serves as a generational legacy that seeks to preserve the spirit of community within the Li clan and family. During Chinese festivals such as the Lunar New Year, Mid-Autumn festival and Dragon Boat festival, the clan will organise a huge celebration and invite members and their families to participate. Through these cultural festivals, the clan members try to teach the younger generations the meanings behind the festivals, to nurture their appreciation of Chinese heritage.
Values through Sports
Serving as a sports school in the olden days, where there were no public gyms or sports facilities, Chin Woo Athletic Association offered members training for a variety of sports when it was founded in 1921.
Over the years, the association has built up a reputation for its impressive lion dance and martial arts performances, and its members often perform at various festivals and events. In addition to performing, Chin Woo also teaches its motto to members as a way of passing down its culture and heritage. Translated to English, it reads, “Love one’s country, cultivate one’s character, righteousness, and helping others.”
Jack Tan, the 56-year-old Vice Secretary of Chin Woo Athletic Association, adds, “We teach them the Chin Woo motto so that they understand how to be loyal to our country, and be self-disciplined and kind to people. These are all part of Chinese values.”
Kwong Yuen Hung, General Secretary of Chin Woo (left) and Jack Tan, Vice Secretary of Chin Woo
What most may not know, though, is that Chin Woo’s history has strong ties with Singapore’s history, and one that the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew played a part in. According to the General Secretary of Chin Woo, Kwong Yuen Hung, Mr Lee used to watch their practice sessions as a boy at their training grounds, now known as Duxton Plain Park.
Kwong, 80, reveals that the values of Chin Woo resonated so strongly with Mr Lee that in 1965, he made a speech to the members of the association about enlisting in the army.
The Challenges Ahead
Though their cultural and historical significance is acknowledged, all three organisations admit that they face difficulties in keeping up with the times, especially when it comes to recruiting younger members.
While it is challenging, efforts have been made to reach out to the younger folk, and capture their interest. Siong Leng fuses its traditional Nanyin music with current genres like jazz; Kwong Wai Siew is planning to create an online presence; while Chin Woo tailors its performances to make them fun and enjoyable for the young, and organises overseas trips and performances. In the face of progress and modernisation, the associations will continue to work hard to capture the hearts and commitment of the next generation.

THE FIVE-DOLLAR TREE
  A majestic icon stands, tucked away within the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG). At 30 metres tall, its commanding presence dominates its surrounding landscape. It is a tree - a tembusu - believed to be at least 150 years old as of 2016 and which probably existed before the Gardens was set up in 1859. Perhaps, its most striking feature is a curled and low-lying branch, which makes it stand out from the other trees in the Gardens. This tree holds great significance in the nation's heritage: Affectionately known as the ""Five-Dollar Tree"", it is the iconic tree found on the Singapore five-dollar note, drawn by local artist Eng Siak Loy.
TEMBUSU TREES
The tembusu, also known as the Fagraea fragrans, is commonly found in Southeast Asia. The trees are plentiful in Singapore, with many old ones still present at the Tanglin area where flora has survived the course of Singapore's development. The tembusu bark often has deep fissures; it flowers twice a year in May and October with white and yellow blooms, and is often pollinated by nocturnal moths that feed on its round berries. Its wood is durable, tough and frequently used to make chopping boards. The tree has been likened metaphorically to a ""lover's hard heart"" by Singaporean poets.
While conical in shape when young, tembusu tees tend to become very tall and irregularly-shaped upon maturity. These older trees usually grow a few horizontal and short branches, which in turn bear many tall and vertical branchlets. The tembusu is regarded as a slow-growing tree that is robust and resistant to many pests and diseases.
HISTORY OF THE ""FIVE-DOLLAR TREE""
The widely-recognized tembusu is featured on Singapore's current five-dollar notes as of 2016. While the actual age and origins of the tree are unknown, it had probably grown naturally on the leftover wasteland of gambier planting days before the SBG was set up. Its earliest documentation was in the 1880s, by a British named Walter Fox. At that time, Fox was the Assistant Superintendent of the SBG, a position he held from 1879 to 1903. Fox had recorded the existence of the tembusu tree in his horticultural guide of the gardens that was published in 1889, and also produced in the guide the earliest known photograph of the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" to date, taken in the 1880s. Given that the tree was already mature when Fox wrote his horticultural guide, it is evident as of 2016 that the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" is now well beyond 150 years old!
ONE OF A KIND
Unmistakably, the most defining feature of this venerable tembusu tree is the thick, low-lying and twirled horizontal branch that stems from its main trunk. It is unclear exactly why this tree sports a unique branch, but common consensus agrees that when lower tembusu branches are left unpruned, they sag towards the ground and then ""turn up"" as they continue growing. Moreover, since this tree existed before the Gardens was set up, it likely grew amidst lower canopies and secondary rainforest growth that existed then, resulting in the low-growing branch. It is this iconic branch that gave Singaporean artist Eng Siak Loy his inspiration for the five-dollar bill design.
ON THE FIVE-DOLLAR NOTE
Besides the five-dollar note, Eng has also designed for the other currency denominations. His drawings were selected after he won a design competition organized by the Monetary Association of Singapore, from which winning designs were selected for the 1999 Singapore Currency Portrait Series. Eng has a distinct impression of the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" since his youth, especially when he worked for the National Parks Board as a graphic designer at the SBG.
""The theme for the five-dollar note was 'Garden City', so I wanted to select a tree native to Singapore. I settled on this particular tembusu because it is a distinct landmark that locals and tourists recognize at the Botanic Gardens,"" said Eng. ""The main thing I want to capture was the unique branch. There are many tembusu trees around, but none of them look like this one, and you can easily identify this tree just by looking at the branch!"" Eng has also incorporated the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" into his designs for a ""Heritage Trees Stamp"" series, which went on to win many international awards.
CONSERVING THE FIVE-DOLLAR TREE'S HERITAGE
Since the tree is extremely old, measures have been taken to conserve its structural integrity. After many decades of growing without support, the SBG installed a wooden prop beneath the low-lying branch in 1992. Then, in 2003, this prop was replaced with two others for additional support. Without these props, the iconic branch would possibly have broken off under its own weight and compromised the structural integrity of the entire tree. Still, a long-term solution was required because those props were static, unable to adapt to organic changes of a tree and restrictive to a tree's growth patterns.
Eventually, a team of engineers from Singapore Technologies Kinetic developed a dynamic support system in 2014. It had a suspension mechanism to brace the branch a three points without obstructing its growth. A decision was also made to fence the tree up to prevent visitors from stepping on its roots and perching on the horizontal branch. According to the National Parks Board, high visitation had caused soil compaction that had hindered root growth. It was hoped that over time, the leaf litter around the trunk will decompose and enrich the soil together with soil organisms, thereby allowing the tembusu's roots to thrive once again.
Having a photo taken while posing on the iconic horizontal branch used to be a popular trend, but it seems unlikely that visitors today will get a chance to do so again.
OTHER TEMBUSU TREES IN SINGAPORE
The ""Five-Dollar Tree"" is not the only tembusu Heritage Tree in Singapore - twelve others across the country also have the Heritage Tree status - with a couple on St. John's Island and Sentosa Island.
That said, perhaps no other tembusu tree besides the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" will ever achieve similar historical status. With a combination of factors - the unique low-lying branch, the majesty of its physical stature, its presence throughout Singapore's modern history, and its significance on the five-dollar bill - the ""Five-Dollar Tree"" will definitely continue to be a celebrated part of Singapore's heritage at the SBG.
Singapore Botanic Gardens was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 4 July 2015. As of 2016, the Gardens is the first and only tropical botanic garden on the UNESCO's World Heritage List. The Tembusu Tree is one of the Heritage Trees in the Gardens.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 3 - Jan 2017
A pair of beautiful vases was recently acquired by the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and now sits on display in its Trade Gallery. The vases connect many different cultures over the centuries, having travelled the world, from China where it was made in the 18th century, to France, Britain, the United States and today, Singapore. Interestingly, the vases share a connection with the hit British TV drama series, Downton Abbey.

The plot of Downton Abbey in which an American heiress provides much-needed cash to a struggling British aristocratic estate was based on the story of a real-life American heiress named Consuelo Vanderbilt, who lived from 1877 to 1964. She was a famed beauty and socialite, and the daughter of William K. Vanderbilt, one of the richest Americans of the late-19th century, who at one point owned this pair of vases.

Consuelo's wealth and charm attracted the attention of many European suitors. In 1895, she met the Duke of Marlborough at a prominent social event. The duke, who was to later receive a US$2.5 million dowry, owned Blenheim Palace - one of the grandest country houses in England.
The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough inspired one of the most grandiose yet insipid portraits of the time. It was painted by John S. Sargent and still hangs at Blenheim Palace today. The puffy drapery and shallow expressions captured in the panting seemed to reflect their loveless marriage, which ended in 1906.

In 1921, Consuelo re-married Jacques Balsan, a dashing French pilot and heir to a textile fortune. In 1937, a book on their French home in the countryside north of Paris was published. In one of the pictures, you can see sitting on a sumptuous mid-18th century mantle, the ACM's blue vases.
The vases feature a deep glaze, characteristic of porcelains produced in China during the reign of Emperor Qianlong from 1736 to 1745. They were likely to have been exported to Europe soon after they were made because the mounts consisting of dragons cast in bronze and then gilded were added in Parish shortly after. This combination of Chinese and European art was clearly adored by Consuelo Vanderbilt, who represented the taste of aristocracy during the modernist age of gossipy and opulent excess.

Community champion Thamizhavel Govindasamy Sarangapany (20 April 1903-16 March 1974) played an important role in the formation of the Tamil Murasu newspaper. The Tamil Murasu was established in 1935 to educate Tamil immigrants and foster a sense of rootedness to their new land.
Community champion Thamizhavel Govindasamy Sarangapany (20 April 1903-16 March 1974) played an important role in the formation of the Tamil Murasu newspaper. The Tamil Murasu was established in 1935  to educate Tamil immigrants and foster a sense of rootedness to their new land.1
Tamil Murasu was founded by The Management Committee headed by A C Suppiah at the Tamil Reform Association.2 Sarangapany was heavily involved when Tamil Murasu had been set up, playing the role as its editor. The paper aimed to propagate TRA's reformist causes and as such the Tamil Murasu produced its first issue on 6th July 1935 outlining its intention to initiate social reforms.
The paper's ownership was later transferred to Sarangapany around 1936.3 Sarangapany had bought the paper despite the financial difficulties involved in running it, as he was keen in enforcing social reforms amongst the Tamil community in Singapore.4 He also advocated for Tamil to feature as one of Singapore’s four official languages.
Settling in Singapore
Thamizhavel Govindasamy Sarangapany moved to Singapore at 21 from Thiruvarur in Tamil Nadu, India.5 He was well-educated and thus able to secure a respectable job as an accountant at an import-export firm in Market Street.
His arrival in 1924 coincided with a large wave of Indian migration to Malaya. In 1911, the Indian population in Singapore stood at about 28,500. By 1931, this number had grown to about 50,900 Indians.

Community advocate
Sarangapany, driven by a progressive mindset and a fervent desire to improve the circumstances of the impoverished and illiterate Tamil population in Malaya, spearheaded several initiatives. In 1930, he set up the Tamil Reform Association to uproot dated beliefs, overhaul attitudes towards the caste system, and put an end to vices and social problems such as addiction to toddy, a cheap alcoholic substance.6

He practised what he preached. Breaking away from social norms with regards to caste, he married a Chinese Peranakan woman- Madam Lim Boon Neo, in 1937.  He also officiated Hindu weddings for couples from different castes.7

In 1935, he was heavily involved in the efforts carried out by TRA to start a newspaper called Tamil Murasu to educate and unify the diverse Indian community.8  (The newspaper’s name translates to Tamil drum, in reference to an old practice where drums used to be sounded for community announcements.) He sold it for a cent.9 In the 1950s, the Tamil Murasu served as a platform to encourage immigrants to acquire Singapore citizenship.10 

To encourage the development of Tamil literary arts, Sarangapany rolled out a weekly student supplement in the paper to motivate youth to write and submit poems, essays, and short stories. Manavar Murasu, which still runs today, helped nurture and cultivate a pool of successful writers such as the award-winning poet Kavignareru Amallathasan.

Separately, Sarangapany also set up the Tamil Education Society to improve the curriculum and recruitment of well-trained teachers for Tamil schools in Singapore Tamil schools.11

As part of efforts to raise the profile of the Tamil language, Sarangapany lobbied tirelessly for its inclusion as an official language in Singapore. His wish was fulfilled after Singapore gained independence.

Sarangapany's contributions towards shaping and building a united Singapore have not gone unnoticed. In 1996, the association of Singapore Tamil writers started the Thamizhavel award for Tamil writers in his honour.12 Later in 2004, the G. Sarangapany education trust fund was established to help students.13 The G. Sarangapany education trust fund continues to contribute via endowments and donations to organisations such as the Singapore Indian Education Trust.14

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/naraina-pillai/story,"TL;DR
Naraina Pillai was the first Tamil to set foot in Singapore, arriving in style in 1819 in the same vessel as Stamford Raffles who was on his second visit to the island.1 Formerly a government clerk in Penang,2 Pillai found himself having to restart his career in Singapore. He was quick to find his footing and did well enough to construct Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple, the Sri Mariamman Temple,3 in 1827.
Naraina Pillai was one of the first Indians to set foot in Singapore. He came onboard The Indiana4 along with Stamford Raffles.
Giving Singapore a try
While working as a government clerk for the British in Penang,5 Naraina Pillai was enticed by Stamford Raffles' effusive praise for the strategically located and freshly established colony of Singapore.6 Deciding to seek out new prospects, Pillai packed his bags and accompanied Raffles on his second visit to Singapore via The Indiana. They arrived in May 1819. The move earned him the title of the first recorded Indian immigrant to step foot in Singapore.
Brick by brick
However, upon arrival, Pillai learnt that he had to rebuild his career from scratch. His first job, a temporary role to help weed out counterfeit money in the colonial treasury, did not amount to much.
Instead of being disheartened, Pillai sought to restart his career. Seeing that the burgeoning city of Singapore lacked housing infrastructure, he decided to set up a brickworks. Pillai wrote to his contacts abroad, seeking bricklayers, carpenters and artisans from Penang and South India to join him.7 His foresight earned him yet another entry in the record books which credit him for starting Singapore’s first brick company. Pillai’s kiln was located at Mount Erskine (Tanjong Pagar today).8
Pillai found even more commercial success in the form of a textile shop which he established at Cross Street. Owing to an arrangement he had with British merchants who allowed him to retain bundles of cloth and cotton products on credit, his shop became famous for its wide variety. This venture, however, was disrupted when a fire destroyed his shop. Not taking the setback lying down, Pillai approached Raffles — the reason he was in Singapore in the first place — for help. Raffles obliged, providing him with a piece of prime land at Commercial Square (Raffles Place today) which Pillai put to good use.9
An outstanding community leader
Now a rather prominent member of society, Pillai was often approached by other Indian settlers for help and counsel. Just three years after his arrival, the British made Pillai leader of the Indian community.10
Pillai made it his mission to build Singapore’s first Hindu shrine, writing to the authorities for a plot of land.11 His wish was granted in 1823 after he was allocated a suitable site at South Bridge Road. The shrine was completed in 1827.
Over the decades, the temple underwent various refurbishments. Two updates in particular were significant. The first involved Indian convicts and craftsmen from Madras (Chennai today) who helped build a brick version of the temple in 1843. Subsequently, in the early 1860s, skilled artisans from the Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts of Tamil Nadu in South India were hired to build a more permanent structure — the basis for the very building which stands in Chinatown today.12

  Remembering Pillai
The Sri Mariamman Temple has been an integral part of the community from the get-go. In its early years, it was the only site in the city where priests could solemnise Hindu marriages.13 Today, it continues to serve as sacred grounds for a variety of everyday rituals and festivities. To commemorate the temple’s storied past, cultural contributions and founder’s legacy, it was gazetted as a national monument in 1973.
The Sri Mariamman Temple which was gazetted as a national monument in 1973, serves hundreds of devotees and tourists daily.
Pillai’s legacy was also recognised in 1957 when the authorities named a road in Serangoon after him.14
More recently in 2019, a statue honouring his contributions to Singapore was installed along the Singapore River as part of the nation’s bicentennial celebrations.15
Pillai’s story is also commemorated at the Indian Heritage Centre.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-snake-in-the-banyan-tree/story,"Have you heard the beating of the kompang? The flat round drum is often used in Malay weddings and makes a very interesting thumping sound. Even more interesting is the story of how the drum came about.
Long ago, in the northwest of Singapore, there stood at the very entrance of a village an enormous banyan tree. The villagers wanted to cut the tree down not only because it blocked their way, but also because every night a haunting melody would float out of the foliage and send everyone into a deep slumber.
When the villagers awoke in the morning, they would always find the bones of their missing chickens and goats at the foot of the banyan tree.
The people were baffled. “We don’t know what’s living inside that tree,” said Hussein, scratching his head in dismay. “We have to destroy that tree! It is cursed,” exclaimed Ishyak nervously. His home was located closest to the tree and he was always the first to fall asleep.
“I have lost all of my chickens. I can’t afford to lose any more goats!” lamented Daud, looking down at his five hungry children. The village chief decided it was time to do something about that tree. Grabbing his spear, he ordered the men to surround the tree with flaming torches.
When they threw their torches at the tree, the same chilling music resonated from within. It cast a spell on those nearby, causing them to fall asleep immediately. Ali, who was deaf and unaffected by the magical music, was shocked to see a gigantic snake with red patchy skin slithering out of the crackling, charred branches.
“Wake up, wake up!” he cried to his friends as the snake hissed angrily at him. Then an idea struck him. From a nearby well, he quickly drew a bucket of cold water and splashed it on the men to rouse them.
“Wh…what happened?” muttered Hussein. But before anyone could answer, the snake sprang at them. All the men struck the reptile’s body repeatedly with their weapons but its chunky trunk-like body was as hard as a rock. Terrified and exhausted, the men dropped their weapons and fled home.
A vision came to the villagers as they lay in bed that night. They dreamt that the snake could only be destroyed by special fire stones, which would burn when water was added to them. However, they had to wait till the next month when the wicked serpent would drift into a deep sleep.
Days slipped by. Then weeks. At the appointed time, the villagers eagerly gathered again at the banyan tree. Soon, they began hurling fire stones at the tree and flinging water at them. The tree shook violently as it burst into flames and a part of the snake rolled out.
A slew of arrows hit the snake in the head but it continued to mesmerise the men with its music. “Stuff your ears with cloth!” suggested Ishyak.
Unable to put his attackers to sleep, the snake was powerless. After countless blows, it squirmed and quivered and collapsed to the ground like a dead log.
The villagers punished the snake by skinning it. They stretched its skin on a bowl and began beating it. As each person struck the skin, it made a surprisingly interesting sound. Played out together, the music was rather delightful.
And thus the kompang was born. So whenever you see or hear a kompang, you will recall the trouble it brought as well as the beauty it created.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/haji-hashim-haji-abdullah/story,"Bridging the gap between education and knowledge and the Malay/Muslim community, Haji Hashim Bin Haji Abdullah was more than a bookstore owner – he wrote a chapter of the history of Singapore Malays with the longevity of his humble bookstore.

BACKGROUND
Born in 1900 in Singapore, Hj Hashim Bin Abdullah (1900 – 1968) came from a Semarang family of merchants who were involved with the trading of the literary field – poets, authors, writers, publishers, and scribes.
Eventually, the newer generation would pick up the pen, and this was the beginning of the first bookstore by his father, Haji Abdullah Bin Muhammad Said.
His uncle, Muhammad Bin Muhammad Said, was the author of several well-known Malay fables that have transcended through time. He was also the Head Principal of a local madrasah in Bussorah Street, which served as a platform for him to disseminate his writings.
His other uncle, Mujtahid Bin Muhammad Said, was the publisher of those said books.
Being in a family of authors and publishers naturally motivated Haji Hashim to open his own bookstore; he eventually fulfilled that dream.
CAREER AND ACHIEVEMENTS
At 20, Haji Hashim married Esamah Binte Abdul Rahim. In 1922, with the money gifted by his father, the couple opened a bookstore at 134 Arab Street.
He was mainly selling books written and published from both of his uncles, his father, and some of his other relatives who were in the same industry.
However, the bookstore initially ran into financial troubles. Business slowed down during World War II, and books were seen as a novelty in those curfew-laden evenings.
Adding on to those problems was the Arab owner who insisted on selling his share of the shop space to Haji Hashim because of the unrests. In order to buy over that space, Haji Hashim’s wife pawned off her gold. His eldest three children helped to sell traditional food such as nasi lemak, samosas, and nasi jenganan along the streets of Kampong Glam for months.
Even when Haji Hashim’s home got bombed on during World War II, business went on at the bookstore. Despite everything, Haji Hashim was determined to keep the bookstore running, as it was his main source of income to feed his growing family of nine children.
Unsuspectingly, what propelled the business forward was the arrival of the Malayan army that was preparing to join forces with Singapore against the oncoming Japanese troops. While some visited the store to buy books or simply browsed, they all left with a homemade Hari Raya greeting card in hand. At that time, the bookstore profited from the sales of those homemade cards.
After the Japanese Occupation, business began to flourish. This was due to the government’s increased emphasis on education and literature. New schools were opened, but students did not have textbooks. They used only pieces of papers or information to study. Haji Hashim compiled these into complete books to be used by his children. Soon, he started supplying proper school textbooks to Malay schools and madrasahs. The store later also became a well-known book distributor in Singapore and around the region —particularly in Malaya and Indonesia.
LEGACY
Haji Hashim passed away in 1968, leaving behind his whole family to continue writing the chapters of his bookstore.
Almost a century since it opened, Haji Hashim Bookstore has managed to stand the test of time, withstanding a recent trend of many bookstores that have had to shutter for good due to changing reading habits.
Haji Hashim Bookstore, which is now located at Joo Chiat Complex, is sustained by his grandchildren under Haji Hashim Enterprise. Despite its newly refurbished interior, this bookstore has been through turbulent chapters, mirroring Singapore’s own past, to become what it is today.
Today, it is one of the first local Malay bookstores that is still running, having managed to survive the war and unrests of pre-independence. Its legacy as a haven of knowledge for the Malay and Muslim community lives on.

Self-made millionaire Lim Kim San (30 November 1916 – 20 July 2006) was handpicked to serve as the Housing and Development Board’s (HDB) first chairman. He was tasked to help make good on the People's Action Party's promise of providing public housing for the masses. Working quickly and without pay, he rolled out a series of measures to overhaul building practices, leading the HDB to complete more than 31,000 flats in the span of four years – far more than its predecessor, the Singapore Improvement Trust built in three decades.

The township of Toa Payoh was developed by the Housing Development Board in the latter half of the 1960s as part of its efforts to address Singapore’s housing shortage.1 (c.1960s. Image from the National Collection)
Millionaire by 34
The oldest of six children, the Singapore-born Lim studied at Anglo-Chinese School and graduated from Raffles College with a diploma in economics. From a young age he was exposed to his family’s business which dealt with rubber, salt, sago and gasoline.
After the war, the business-savvy Lim worked at a sago plant where he devised a cost-effective method to produce sago pearls, an ingredient commonly used in Asian cuisine. This innovation helped him make his first million.
In the 1950s, Lim served as director of two banks.2
No nonsense approach to public housing
In 1959, Lim was approached by Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee — — members of the People's Action Party (PAP) — to serve in the Public Service Commission. Later, Goh, the finance minister, asked Lim to chair the newly-formed Housing Development Board (HDB) which was established to rehome hundreds of thousands living in squalor. Lim, who took up the role, did not draw a salary for four years.
Plunging himself into the role, Lim implemented sweeping changes to standardise the building and construction sector. Dedicated to his mission of providing affordable housing to the masses, he cut red tape, ended dodgy and corrupt practices, and assembled a team of powerhouses to work alongside him.3
Known for being hands-on, he visited worksites often and at times picked up on major construction errors. For instance, he noticed that a block of flats at Margaret Drive in Queenstown was crooked and its contractor was made to rebuild it.
The resultant speed in which high quality flats rose across the island is said to have contributed to the PAP’s landslide victory in the 1963 elections. For solving Singapore’s public housing dilemma, Lim was awarded the Order of Temasek, the state’s most prestigious honour.4 He was the first such person to receive it.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Sri-Warisan-Shaping-a-Singapore-Malay-dance-identity/Sri-Warisan-Shaping-a-Singapore-Malay-dance-identity,"Established in 1997, Sri Warisan Som Said Performing Arts is Singapore’s first professional Malay dance company. Since the 1950s, its founder and pioneer dancer/choreographer Madam Som Said has been building on centuries of tradition while also innovating through cross-cultural collaborations.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Sri Warisan

  The Malay dance scene in Singapore had long absorbed influences, forms and techniques from regional royal courts, grassroots and popular movements, as well as styles from further afield including Indian, Portuguese and Arabic dances. In the 1960s, Indonesian choreographers helped fashion the course of modern Malay dance through their collaborations with multidisciplinary arts group Sriwana, and Nanyang University.
Madam Som, an alumnus of Sriwana before establishing Sri Warisan Som Said Performing Arts in 1997, was already accomplished in the regional dance styles. However, she was determined to create a dance identity that would reflect the lifestyles, values and heritage of Malays in Singapore. Hence, Madam Som drew from both the foundations of regional dance forms and the interactions of a multicultural society.
“My initial works were based on Malay customs, guided by the Islamic teachings and rich cultural values, with the use of symbolic props and gestures to portray Malay aesthetic values”, the Cultural Medallion winner added. After a training stint at the Padepokan Seni Bagong academy, under Indonesian dance master Bagong Kusudiarjo, she added contemporary techniques that further evolved Malay dance here.
Today, the productions of Sri Warisan continue to be inspired by the heritage and traditions of Southeast Asia, such as the heroic Tun Fatimah of Malacca, and Radin Mas, the Javanese princess that gave her name to the area in Telok Blangah.
Innovating and safeguarding heritage
Sri Warisan’s productions in the 21st century have included Onak Samudera - The Untold Dance Journey (2014), Bendahara - A Betrayal (2012) and Towkay Wayang - A Musical (2009). The group has also grown into a multidisciplinary collective, helping sustain the performing traditions of dance, bangsawan (opera), angklung (a Javanese music form) and wayang kulit (shadow puppet plays).
“We preserve (performing traditions) through teaching, conducting classes and workshops, and we promote them by performing, and we create (new works). When we create, we embrace the roots, but we create with platforms where we allow the youths to hold on to their traditions (while interpreting them) in their own way. This allows us to move forward (while) safeguarding our heritage”, says Madam Som.
Mdm Som Said passing on her skills and knowledge in Malay Dance movements and techniques to young learners, 2020. Courtesy of National Heritage Board.
Her son Adel Ahmad, Sri Warisan’s managing director and second generation practitioner, adds: “We want to make sure that (through) Malay dance, bangsawan, wayang kulit, dikir barat, angklung, (we can) reach out to everybody…(and that audiences) will be touched by and relate to these performing arts.”
The changing tastes and perspectives of audiences have also led to necessary reinvention. Acknowledging that some may view traditional art forms like wayang kulit as staid and irrelevant to the current milieu, Adel and the Sri Warisan artists have introduced modern elements including digital graphics and animation to their productions.
Reaching out to the next generation
After taking over the management of the company in 2000, Adel set the goal of having Sri Warisan tour 100 cities over the next two decades. That intent was fulfilled four years ahead of schedule, in 2016. Of Sri Warisan’s international scope, he says: “Our dancers learn something at every festival and use that knowledge to train others.” He also focused on developing more dance teachers and trainers, ensuring that the company could expand its programmes to more schools and institutions.
Each year, Sri Warisan performs at more than 200 local and international events and festivals, while also conducting more than 3,000 courses and workshops. Their dance courses, tailored for different levels, encompass traditional Malay forms while also taking in dances from the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Thailand. The company also offers other lessons in other performing arts including wayang kulit, and their music workshops span forms such as angklung, kompang, dikir barat and Asian drumming techniques.
Since 1993, the group has also worked closely with schools and other performing companies through the National Arts Council Arts Education programme. Melding dance with cultural education, Sri Warisan’s programmes in this area deepen the understanding of various aspects of our heritage, including cultural festivals, kampung life, Southeast Asian legends and epics, as well as place histories.
Continuing in the vital currents of collaboration and cultural intersections that characterised Singapore’s post-independence dance scene, Sri Warisan has collaborated with other groups including Bhaskar Arts Academy, the Chinese Opera Institute, Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society (SIFAS) and the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. In 2002, Sri Warisan’s dancers collaborated with SIFAS, Hua Yan Buddhist Society and the Chinese Opera Institute in The Fifth Lotus and travelled to India to perform the Ramayana with Apsaras Arts in 2009.
Madam Som says: “I hope that the future generation, while busy with promoting their own ethnic dance and moving towards contemporary [dance], will still find time to continue this legacy to work together as one across races.”

Singapore’s National Anthem would have sounded completely different had its composer Zubir Said (22 July 1907-16 November 1987) adhered to family traditions. From a conservative Sumatran household which believed music was haram, Zubir picked up music secretly and made his own instruments. He eventually left for Singapore and embarked on a prolific career, composing more than 1,500 songs for film, radio and the national stage. His repertoire includes the masterpiece, Majulah Singapura. His timeless and evocative melodies continue to attract a new generation of fans online, with some proclaiming that his music “needs to be on Spotify”.
Watch: The Golden Era - Zubir Said
  Marching to the beat of his own drum
His father considered music haram but that did not stop Zubir Said from pursuing his interest in music.1
In primary school, the Sumatra-born Zubir carved his own flute out of bamboo and participated in a band with other young flautists.2 In middle school, he picked up the guitar and drums.3
With pressing financial needs, a career in music was a pipe dream for Zubir. He thus took on work as a brickmaker and copy typist until an encounter with a Dutch district officer inspired him to pursue his passion. To this end, he became the leader of a roving keroncong (an Indonesian style of music) band which moved from village to village in Sumatra. They played at functions such as weddings and fun fairs.
His father, however, was very eager to have him take over as village chief, or enter into a career in the Dutch army or administration. At 21, Zubir had enough. He left for Singapore in a cargo vessel.4 The metropolis was his port of choice, having been sold on the idea by a sailor friend who told him about the colony’s glittering lights, and the availability of kopi susu (coffee with milk) and butter.
Malay film and music pioneer
Zubir's started his music career in Singapore with a bangsawan (a form of Malay operatic theatre) troupe, performing with them at the Happy Valley amusement park in Tanjong Pagar. There, he picked up new skills and instruments such as the piano while gradually rising through the ranks and eventually becoming the troupe's leader.
In 1936, he was recruited by the British-owned record label His Master's Voice, or HMV, as a recording supervisor. By this time, Zubir was fairly well-known. The war, however, did a number on his career and he returned to his hometown with his two wives and children. In 1947, after the war, Zubir returned to Singapore where he found work as a part-time photographer at Malay language newspaper Utusan Melayu.
His big break coincided with the golden age of the Malay film industry. In 1949, he began work at Shaw Brothers’ Malay Film Production division. There, he composed songs for Malay films5 and box office hits such as Chinta (Love), a romantic drama about a village girl and a shipwrecked stranger who turns out to be a king.
However, Zubir felt unfulfilled in this role so he left the company for Cathay-Keris' Malay film arm where he was given the opportunity to set the tone for entire movies by creating custom background mood music and orchestral arrangements.6 This was a major shift from the industry’s reliance on European tracks and was thus a role he cherished.7 Zubir also wrote songs for musical greats such as P. Ramlee, R. Ismail and Nona Asiah; and produced Malay classics such as Sayang Di Sayang, Pulang Merantau and Cempaka Biru.
Zubir was involved in a number of acclaimed films such as Jula Juli Bintang Tiga and Dang Anom which picked up awards at the Asian Film Festival in 1959 and 1962. Critics noted his ability to move audiences to tears with his soothing, melancholic pieces. Zubir eventually retired from Cathay-Keris in 1964.

The genesis of Majulah Singapura
Zubir’s undisputable talent and his one-of-a-kind sound which helped define an era, caught the attention of Singapore’s City Council in 1958. It invited him to write an official song based on the motto Majulah Singapura (onward Singapore in Malay).10
Zubir’s composition was performed for the first time on 6 September 1958 at a concert to mark Victoria Theatre’s reopening,11 and at other mass events such as a Youth Rally at the Padang the following February. His contributions towards Singapore’s nationalistic efforts was well-received, moving audiences with its powerful expression of the progressive spirit of Singapore and the aspirations of its people.
A version of Majulah Singapura was subsequently introduced to the public as the national anthem on 3 December 1959, the same year Singapore attained self-government.12 It was a momentous occasion where the first Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara (head of state in Malay), Yusof bin Ishak, had also been inaugurated. Zubir's father, now 101 in age, travelled from Indonesia to witness the occasion following decades of estrangement.
Zubir was said to have been incredibly honoured by the opportunity to contribute to the nationalist efforts of the period. He understood the power that music had in rousing patriotic feelings13 and fostering a sense of connection between people during an era marked by instability and change.

Musical legacy
Over the course of his life, Zubir wrote 1,500 songs, a number of which were dedicated to the community. Orang Singapura, for instance, was about being a kind and graceful person of Singapore.14 He also wrote a song for birthday celebrations which he called Selamat. Semoga Bahagia is yet another stirring composition of his. In it, he reminds the youth of Singapore to pursue their dreams and happiness, as he had.15
Recognising his contributions to the nation, the government of Singapore embarked on an effort to track down Zubir's scores and lyrics in the 1980s.16 Later, in the 2000s, as part of an effort to further Zubir’s legacy, his family signed an agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group which manages his repertoire, to allow his work to be available for download, and to be recorded by other artistes.
His daughter, Rohana Zubir, also worked on a project to document her father’s life and prolific career. Her book, Zubir Said: The Composer of Majulah Singapura, was published in 2012.
In 2009, a road was named after him in Dhoby Ghaut.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Michael-Ker-Making-heritage-food-that-stands-the-test-of-time/story,"Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Popiah has been based in Joo Chiat for more than eight decades, having been started by third-generation owner Michael Ker’s grandfather as a pushcart hawker business. His grandfather, an immigrant from Anxi in China’s Fujian province, married a Peranakan woman from Malacca and turned out popiah in the Nyonya style, with its characteristic filing including stewed turnips (bangkwang), prawns and chilli.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Michael Ker

Heritage food establishments like Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Popiah that have stood the test of time are often asked about their secret recipes. Given that these venerable formulas bestowed through the generations are often the key to drawing and retaining a loyal clientele, heirloom recipes and methods are not shared on a whim.
Ker, however, will tell you his family’s recipe without skipping a beat. “The secret recipe is experience – when your hand touches the dough, you will instinctively know whether you need to add more water, salt or oil”, he says.
Perfecting the craft of hand-made popiah skins
Popiah skins have been hand-made at Kway Guan Huat since 1938, and it is this dedication to traditional methods that have taken the shop through decades of changing tastes and pressures for more efficient production via automation.
Kway Guan Huat’s emphasis on the hand-made process renders the popiah skins more chewy, springy and translucent than machine-made ones, and hand-made skins are favoured by customers despite lasting only a day due to their lack of preservative agents.
The experience that Ker speaks of is an integral element in producing hand-made popiah skins. At Kway Guan Huat, this process involves the dough recipe, a pair of cast-iron hotplates forged in the Jalan Sultan area more than 50 years ago, and the techniques of hand-working the dough. Only by putting in the thousands of hours into mixing, twisting and swirling the dough can one gain the necessary experience to work the deceptively simple mixture of flour, water, salt, and oil – one which Ker has kept alive as a third-generation practitioner and owner.
The dough is then left to ferment for a couple of hours, before being beaten with a wooden paddle. Once air bubbles form, the dough is ready for cooking. Flipping a 400g handful of dough onto the hotplates, Ker is heedless of the 150-degree Celsius heat from the plates.
The technique of flipping the dough onto the hotplates was learnt through countless episodes of getting burnt as he studied at the hands of his father and uncles since the age of 13. During festive occasions, when demand for popiah skins is high, everyone at Kway Guan Huat would make skins for more than 12 hours straight.
Keeping traditional food heritage alive
Ker says of the popiah-making process: “I wake up early in the morning and I do the popiah skins, making hundreds to thousands of pieces every day. This is like practising yoga or tai chi every day; if I don’t do it, I feel a bit uneasy.” It is mastery of a food culture born of dedicated practice; Ker took several years to truly become an expert in handling the skins.
This commitment to a life of craft was not what Ker’s father intended for him. “When I was a young boy, my father never wanted me to take over the family business. He was always pushing me to study hard, get a job outside in an air-conditioned room”, he says. Instead, Ker kept polishing his techniques, eventually left a career as a pharmacist, and took over the business in 2013.
“I decided to carry on our family tradition of making popiah because it goes back three generations. It would been a pity if I didn’t do it and the heritage of this food vanished. From an air-conditioned office, I moved to a hot, sweaty environment with long hours. It’s tiring, it’s hard work, but it’s something I feel is precious”, he adds.
Even as Kway Guan Huat is known for its traditional methods and traditional tastes, Ker has innovated to sustain the business, including introducing pandan-flavoured popiah skins and roast duck fillings. Recalling the communal and family-centric nature of popiah meals in years past, the shop offers packages for convenient group dining, and has also established an online presence.
Keeping popiah culture alive is another focus for Ker. He has been conducting education workshops and demonstrations for tourists, local groups, and students, which delve into the cultural history of popiah and are paired with tastings. The shop will also be installing a heritage gallery, where Ker can “explain the origins of this heritage food, the culture, the techniques and the craft of making [popiah]”, he says.

In this vein, Ker collaborated with the Singapore Tourism Board and other corporations to showcase the popiah craft at food festivals worldwide, including in New York, Copenhagen and Dubai.
Ker continues to transmit the popiah craft by passing on time-honoured techniques to younger members of the family. “I hope I can spur the younger generations to take the unconventional path”, he says, adding: “But it must come from them, you can’t force it. It’s not an easy thing to do.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Nam-Hwa-Opera-Tradition-professionalism-and-cultural-transmission/story,"For millennia, the performing arts have been a medium for people to express, examine and redefine their culture and heritage. Since Nam Hwa Opera’s earliest days as a group of amateurs brought together by a love of Teochew opera, this spirit of cultural exploration and critical inquiry has been evident.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Nam Hwa
  Ahead of their debut public performance in 1963, the amateur opera enthusiasts had few resources to lean on. Inventively, the performers sought out screenings of the 1962 Teochew opera movie Chen San and Wu Niang, diligently studying the expressions and interactions of characters, including the eponymous lovelorn couple.
Today, after decades of advancing its operatic craft and building itself as an institution, Nam Hwa has established itself as one of Singapore’s premier performing arts companies, with a prolific opera troupe, a Teochew music ensemble, a talent development programme and a cultural research centre under its umbrella.
From its amateur roots to its current roles, what lay behind this consistent attention to detail, this drive to master the fundamentals of chang (singing), nian (reciting) and zuo (acting)? What motivated the performers over the years to absorb the unspoken but myriad range of emotions expressed by the movements of the shui xiu (water sleeves) and other aesthetic elements?
The elements of Teochew opera, from plots to characterisations and performance language, from lyrics and dialogue to set design, speak volumes of the values of generations past. These values include filial piety, loyalty, justice, and the responsibilities and bonds individuals have and maintain within society.
“Roots are important for building up a person’s character by inculcating values, and if you want to keep these values, then the preservation of art forms is key”, says Nam Hwa’s president Toh Lim Mok.
Mastering the art of Singaporean Teochew opera
Dedication to the craft and cultural transmission of Teochew opera has been a vital strand in Nam Hwa’s DNA over the past half-century. For decades, the company moved to professionalise its craft and operations by regularly engaging with directors, performers and trainers from foreign troupes. The expertise of and exchange with foreign practitioners, as well as Nam Hwa’s travels to perform in China, South Korea and Cambodia among other countries, means that the company has absorbed and reflected a wide range of operatic styles.
Along with other local groups, Nam Hwa was also part of the evolution of a Singaporean style of Teochew opera, which has made it different from its Chao Shan origins. While sustaining traditional Chinese values and customs, the practice of Teochew opera here has also organically assimilated influences from the island’s multicultural society.
Determined to engage audiences of different generations and cultural perspectives, Nam Hwa has set traditional stories in modern environments, such as Jin Hua Sending Her Husband Off, a classic tale given a twist with contemporary outfits and familiar accessories such as passports and handbags.
Stories with local narratives, themes and settings, including Match-making at the Five-foot Way and Voyage to Nanyang, have also delighted audiences. Other innovations such as collaborations with Chinese orchestras and experiments with zhe zi xi (excerpt operas) are all closely tied to the company’s philosophy of keeping Teochew opera and culture alive by remaining connected and relevant to the community.
From the opera stage to the Teochew world
Nam Hwa’s well-regarded talent development programme, helmed by opera professionals, also provides different performing pathways and platforms for student performers. Young talents are introduced to the art form through engagements with schools, nurtured through acting, singing and music classes, and given opportunities to shine on the Nam Hwa Blazes platform, a series of free public performances.
One such talent, 17-year-old Tan Wei Tian, says: “I love Teochew opera because it’s a very magical, and fascinating art form. There are many messages and stories to tell from the performances…and I think that our future generations should be able to get to know Teochew opera to have a deeper understanding of their roots and embrace their traditions.”

Tan’s passion for the art form has taken her in front of audiences in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia and China, including at a TEDxSingapore event, and led to her being named as an ambassador for a Singapore Tourism Board campaign.
Nam Hwa’s programmes and workshops extend to the community and amateur circles. Nam Hwa also offers introductory classes for children and adults in acting, dance and vocal fundamentals, stage makeup, the Teochew language, musical performance. To encourage intergenerational learning and exchange, drama courses designed for parents and children to participate in together are also offered.
Beyond training performers and musicians, and giving them platforms to showcase their virtuosity, the company has also established the Yeo Khee Lim Teochew Culture Research Centre. The centre explores the manifold aspects of Teochew opera and the broader cultural heritage it draws upon through a collection of publications, Teochew opera songs digitised from vinyl records, and works produced by Teochew artists.
Established to promote deeper and wider understanding of the Teochew culture among the public, the centre also collaborates with academia and supports further research and documentation through publishing, academic forums, exhibitions and research scholarships.

Into the 21st century, Thow Kwang Pottery Jungle stands as one of two remaining dragon kilns on the island, and the only one still in operation.
Watch: Stewards of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award - Thow Kwang
  A tradition and technology brought to Singapore by Chinese migrants, dragon kilns initially produced mass use pottery such as cups, jars and vats, as well as the latex collectors used in rubber plantations.
Established in the 1940s before being bought by Tan Kim Seh in the 1960s, the Tan family has maintained the continuity of the wood-fired tradition through numerous economic and cultural shifts over the decades. Today, Thow Kwang has shifted from mass to artisanal production, and the Pottery Jungle also hosts workshops, classes, heritage tours and an artists’ group.
While the nature of production has changed, the expertise and knowledge required to work the dragon kiln has been sustained by the Tan family. Tried and tested by earlier generations, the techniques that have been passed down include the judicious arrangement of some 3,000 ceramic pieces inside the kiln, and the kindling of the flame within the firebox, or ‘head’ of the dragon kiln. With the kiln temperature gradually brought to more than 1,200 degrees Celsius, the firing temperature in each chamber is continually monitored and stoked.
“Firing a dragon kiln is (about) teamwork, and (the people of) Thow Kwang Clay Artists have been with us for many years and are experienced in the firing process”, says Yulianti Tan, who is married to Tan Teck Yoke, the son of Thow Kwang’s founder Tan Kim Seh. “We share (knowledge and expertise) with the potters, interest groups, and also open up to the public to let them have first-hand experience of the dragon kiln firing.” On the two to three occasions a year the dragon kiln is fired, artisanal potters and volunteers work in shifts across two to three days, keeping its flame and the traditions of wood-fired pottery alive. Thow Kwang allows potters to fire their own works in the dragon kiln, asking only that they work together to tend the flame.
Artistry and tradition in wood-fired pottery
Resource-heavy and labour-intensive, dragon kilns demand watchful supervision and sustained stoking over several days to produce their ceramic bounty, in contrast to gas and electric kilns, which are easier to handle. However, the unique beauty of wood-fired pottery is tangible. Pieces that emerge from the engulfing flames of dragon kilns bear the glassy, variable imprimatur of ash glazes, possible only with wood-fired pottery and the interaction of fire, clay and fly ash. When you hold a wood-fired ceramic cup or shard in your hand, you hold a thread of tradition that connects generations and across diverse communities.
Growing up in a pottery factory, Teck Yoke and his siblings were exposed to the artistry and tradition of wood-fired pottery since young. As pottery wares were in high demand up to the 1980s, Teck Yoke often spent much of his time at the factory to help out with the production, even when he was a student. Inspired by the hard work of his parents and their dedication to keep the pottery factory going, he continued the family legacy of the dragon kiln as a second-generation practitioner.
For Teck Yoke, the continued operation of the dragon kiln today “records the generations this art has been passed on to, even as Singapore, a young country, has developed”. “I think this experience of the dragon kiln and its firing (would help) our younger generation to learn from our forefathers’ resilience, fortitude and character”, his wife Yulianti adds.
Keeping the flame alive
Thow Kwang’s shift from commercial production has also seen it nurture pottery groups through a range of activities, establish a social media presence, and run programmes for youth, as well as experiment with pottery as rehabilitation therapy for the elderly.
Engaging existing and potential new pottery connoisseurs through social media, as well as running an online store, comes under the purview of Stella Tan, Thow Kwang’s studio director and a third-generation practitioner within the family. She has also ventured into new avenues of business by participating in craft markets, providing customised ceramics for cafes, restaurants and hotels as well as keeping Thow Kwang attuned to contemporary preferences in pottery styles.
Thow Kwang also continues to run ceramics workshops, started by Stella’s aunt Yulianti in 2000, as well as the Thow Kwang Clay Artists group, which provides a platform for potters to practise their skills and sustain their passion.

“We conduct interesting workshops like hand-building (clay) and (working) pottery wheels. These workshops bring (people) closer to the dragon kiln and show them the beauty of the pottery fired in the dragon kiln”, says Stella. Beyond the fundamentals of pottery techniques, design and glazing, Thow Kwang’s workshops also spread knowledge of the history and heritage of dragon kilns in Singapore as well as their firing traditions.”
She added
“ It’s important to carry on the legacy passed down to me from my grandfather, and to share the knowledge and skills of the dragon kiln and wood-fired pottery to (future) generations”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/baharuddin-ariff/story,"Although his name is potentially lost in the pages of Singapore’s history, there is no denying that Baharuddin Mohd Ariff was an integral piece to our nation’s story.
Early Years
Baharuddin bin Mohd Ariff (1933 – 1961) was born in Kuala Lumpur. After completing his education at Kuala Lumpur’s Victoria Institute, he began his career as a journalist.
In 1951, he joined Utusan Melayu, the first Malay-language landmark publication at that time to be wholly owned by Malays. At that time, he saw the challenges that the British reoccupation brought to war-torn Singapore, a nation still unsure of its next step. There were no real solidified laws during that era; instead, there were constant strikes by unsatisfied workers and discontent students.
As a journalist, he often challenged the status quo. He covered the labour worker demonstrations and wrote many articles that were focused on their union movements. From there, he built his credibility as a news gatherer through his thorough investigations, and eventually, his influence on his readers.
On his own time, he also served in several mosque communities and took an active interest in political and trade union work. He was Hon. Secretary of the Singapore Printing Employees’ Union from 1956 to 1957.
Career & Achievements
His incisive articles on the various issues that plagued the nation during those difficult pre-independence years caught the attention of the local political parties. The fact that he was a reporter too, made a stronger case for him to be involved in politics.
Baharuddin saw this as an opportunity to change the dire situations that he had previously just been an observer to. Thus began his political career.
In December 1957, he successfully contested the City Council elections as the People’s Action Party (PAP) candidate for Crawford. Two years later, in 1959, he was elected Assemblyman for Anson, which precipitated a self-government for Singapore.
In between these couple of years, he also served as a committee member of the National Union of Journalists (1957-1959).
Knowing the public gave him an edge – he was aware of the real struggles of his countrymen. Within the PAP, Baharuddin was a star on the rise. Among his plans was to restructure and nationalise the education system. Sadly, time was not on his side. He succumbed to a sudden illness at the young age of 28.
The assemblyman in the PAP unfortunately never saw the country he loved and fought for, in her most pivotal moment. He died in April 1961, four years before Singapore gained her independence.
Legacy
Still, his name lived on through the younger generations who had been schooled at the Former Baharuddin Vocational Institute, along Queensway.
It was Singapore’s first vocational tertiary school that was dedicated to manual and applied arts. Officially opened by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, on 20 June 1965, the vocational institute nurtured skilled local designers and craftsmen in advertising, fashion, and printing trades.
Baharuddin believed in the need for ‘softer skills’ besides the country’s focus on technical workmanship, sciences, engineering and the ilk, the latter being instrumental to the turning point of Singapore’s economy. Courses conducted at Baharuddin Vocational Institute included commercial art, dressmaking, furniture design, pottery, and shell crafts.
The school marked a radical change in Singapore’s education policy. It readied students for skilled jobs in the industrialised city-state. There was also a shift in emphasis of simply gaining basic knowledge. The school invited the workforce to think about upgrading their existing skills.
The Institute relocated to a new site at Stirling Road in 1969.
For the next two decades, Baharuddin Vocational Institute was the main institute that nurtured graphic designers, apprentices, and craftsmen in Singapore.
In 1990, the entire applied arts department from Baharuddin Vocational Institute moved to Temasek Polytechnic to start the School of Design. This led to the closure of the Institute.
Although the name nor the institute is no longer around, the nationalistic values that Baharuddin Mohd Ariff had instilled in the youth will always live on in the dreams of a better Singapore.
To see where the Baharuddin Vocational Institute used to be, and discover other heritage sites within the area, embark on the Queenstown Heritage Trail.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2016
In today’s fast-paced Singapore, it is hard to imagine ancient art forms like Nanyin (南音) and Liyuan (梨 園) opera taking root and finding a following among youths. Yet a Singaporean group in their 20s faithfully immerse themselves in this world of centuries-old musical instruments such as the dongxiao and sanxian, and slow, melodious singing in Southern Min dialect.
“Nanyin is soothing and calming... and not something youngsters in Singapore would chance upon easily,” highlighted Joel Chia, one of the seven principal musicians in the Siong Leng Musical Association.
Siong Leng Musical Association innovates with contemporary stage and musical arrangements of Nanyin, featuring traditional instruments with cross-cultural elements. Soul Journey – Cicada Zen (蝉。息) performed at Esplanade Theatre Studio, July 2012.
The original tone of instruments, tunes, lyrics and vocalisation are carefully preserved through scores and scripts, via a teacher- apprentice system. Watching a Nanyin performance today is similar to watching it in ancient China. Nanyin is often nicknamed the living fossil of ancient Chinese music and was listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2009.

Nanyin and Liyuan Opera
Nanyin (“southern music” in Chinese) is a music genre which originated as court music during the Han Dynasty in China, more than two thousand years ago. As civil unrest over the years uprooted nobles and musicians from the Central Plains, Nanyin took root in the southern coastal area of Quanzhou in Fujian province.
In recent centuries, Nanyin followed the Chinese diaspora and spread to other shores. It reached Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, where large groups of people of southern Chinese origin reside.
Nanyin remains close to its most traditional form, with music, lyrics and instrumental performance methods originating from Song and Tang Dynasty periods. Traditionally, Nanyin is performed by five musicians, with the vocalist seated in the middle and holding a clapper to set the beat. On the left, two musicians would play the dongxiao, a bamboo flute, and the erxian, a two-stringed fiddle. On the right of the vocalist, two other musicians would play the pipa, a Chinese lute, and the sanxian, whose sound is one octave lower than the pipa.
An ancient instrument that survived the times is the sibao, a percussion instrument consisting four pieces of bamboo that is unique to Nanyin,
Illustration from Music of the South, 2004.
What makes Nanyin unique is its close preservation of the art form. The dongxiao has retained its length of one foot eight inches in Nanyin, and while the modern-day pipa is constructed with a straight neck and held upright, Nanyin musicians use a crooked-necked pipa and hold it horizontally, like a guitar.
A natural extension of Nanyin music, Liyuan opera’s origins can be traced to Quanzhou in Fujian, China. Unlike Teochew, Hokkien or Cantonese operas, Liyuan opera is a lesser-known variety of Chinese opera. It is commonly regarded as dramatised Nanyin. Preserving elements and essence of Tang and Song dynasties’ Nan opera, Liyuan opera is one of the most ancient surviving forms of Chinese opera.
Keeping Traditional Art Alive
Siong Leng Musical Association was founded in 1941. Today its mission is to preserve, develop and promote Nanyin and Liyuan Opera. What sets it apart from other traditional performing troupes is that most of the members in the Nanyin section are relatively young, in their 20s, providing an interesting contrast to this ancient art form.
The charm of the old, traditional music is precisely what draws its members together. However, being traditional is a double-edged sword for Nanyin and Liyuan Opera. While its quiet, old-world charm attracts some, others find it hard to endear themselves to these niche art forms.
Lin Shao Ling, Artistic Director of the association in 2016, recognises this challenge. Bold, new directions have been taken to bring Nanyin closer to the local audience. He has experimented with the use of musical instruments such as the Indian tabla and Malay kompang to create fusion performances. During the 2016 Huayi Festival at the Singapore Esplanade, he blended Nanyin and Xinyao songs.

“We want to create a multi-sensorial experience for our audience where they are enveloped in a whole artistic and cultural experience,” Lin shared. “That is why before our performances at the Esplanade, our audiences participate in a ritual of cleansing their hands with flowered water, listening to music and sipping tea amidst the scent of incense. These allow audience members to quieten their hearts and minds and be more ready to experience the soothing Zen-like ambience of Nanyin.”

To reach a bigger audience and stay in touch with older Nanyin appreciators, Siong Leng keeps up an annual tradition of staging three open performances at the Thian Hock Keng Temple and a performance at Kusu Island. The team has also conducted workshops and demonstrations at public libraries, and continues to hold special workshops at its Bukit Pasoh premises.
The passion to keep the art form alive keeps Lin and his team going. This is a spirit they inherited from the late Teng Mah Seng, a Cultural Medallion recipient and former chairman of Siong Leng, who was a prolific Nanyin artist himself, composing more than a hundred Nanyin songs.
In 1983, Teng brought Siong Leng’s artists to compete overseas, walking away with a third prize in the Folk Solo category at the 37th Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. It was the first time Nanyin had shone on the world stage. The feat was repeated in 2010 when Siong Leng took part in the same contest and clinched first prize.
Celestina Wang, Executive Director of Siong Leng, was a protégé of the late Teng. She was tasked to run the association after his passing, and still looks to Teng’s legacy of foresight for guidance. “Mr Teng’s undying spirit in promoting Nanyin and Liyuan Opera continues to spur us to greater heights,” Wang said.
Cultivating the Next Generation of Artists
For Wang, her key challenge is to keep this cultural endeavour going. ""In five to ten years, we need a new generation of musicians and instructors to take the association further,"" she said.
The current hand-picked team of seven young local musicians, including Wang’s two sons, were selected to join the association during their teenage years. Since 1999, they have been journeying to China for intensive training with Nanyin masters. Back at Siong Leng, they are also taking up roles in administration and marketing even as they prepare for performances throughout the year.
Siong Leng's seven - a new generation of young principal musicians being groomed to lead the association, 2013.
Over the years, the seven have grown to become a close-knit group. “An intimate bond and a level of chemistry have built up between the seven of us after playing Nanyin together for so many years and training together,” said Cassandra Wang, principal musician and teacher of pipa and sanxian at Siong Leng.
Looking Ahead
Lin strives to produce quality contemporary Nanyin presentations that Singaporeans will come to know and appreciate. He shared: “It is also my hope that Siong Leng can take Nanyin and Liyuan opera into the international scene. Even more pressing is the transmission of culture, which must happen together with the passing of the art to the next generation.”
It is this dedication to heritage and culture that makes Siong Leng Musical Association a treasured organisation in Singapore.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/themeparks-in-singapore/story,"Before the advent of television and the glittering thoroughfares of Orchard, many looked to other avenues of amusement to entertain themselves. From the 1920s to the early 1990s, Singapore’s nightlife was filled with the sights and sounds of revellers enjoying themselves at its amusement parks. An era of variety shows, risqué cabaret dances, Hokkien and Malay troupe performances, rickety rides, and wrestling matches, these parks captivated both adults and children alike. Today’s glitzy amusement parks court relatively tamer acts, but the amusement parks of yesteryear defined and set the tone for them.
New World Amusement Park

Singapore’s earliest amusement park was set up by Straits Chinese brothers and businessmen, Ong Boon Tat and Ong Peng Hock in 1923. Riding on the coattails of the previously successful Malaya-Borneo exhibition that had attracted 300,000 visitors with its Ferris wheel and carousel, international trade fair, cinemas, football matches and cultural performances, the brothers established New World amusement park along the area bounded by Jalan Besar , Kitchener Road, Serangoon Road and Petain Road.
Within a decade, the park acquired a reputation for its boxing contests, opera performances and cabaret shows . In the 1930s, the park was completely bought over by the Shaw Brothers who had an initial stake in the park. The end of the war revived the park when it introduced striptease as part of its attractions.

By the 1960s, however, New World could no longer compete with the arrival of shopping malls and television, and slowly faded from Singapore’s entertainment scene. It finally closed in 1987 when the Shaw Organisation sold the land for commercial development. Today, City Square mall, a condominium and a park sit on the amusement park’s old grounds. Only New World’s original entrance gate remains standing today.
Great World Amusement Park

The second “world” to open was Great World amusement park in 1931 – its owner, Lim Choon Yung – a relative of philanthropist Lee Kong Chian. Sitting on the crossroads of Kim Seng, River Valley and Zion Road , the park boasted live shows, travelling circuses, Shanghainese and Cantonese operas, Malay Bangsawan theatre , boxing matches, as well as a zoo and a coloured water fountain.
Despite its patronage of society’s upper classes and British servicemen, business soon became lacklustre, impelling Lee Choon Yung to sell his land and park to the Shaw Brothers in 1941. Soon after, World War II descended on the region and the Japanese Occupation saw the transformation of the park into a prison for Australian POWs, and later, a gambling den.

The end of the Occupation allowed Great World to return to its former glory in a bigger way: with carnival rides like carousels and Ferris wheels, the installing of fountains, and revue shows. During its heyday, the park was said to enjoy attendances of up to 50,000 a night . Also facing rival entertainment, Great World saw declining visitors till its closure in 1964. The Shaw Foundation sold the park to a property developer who eventually constructed the present Great World City Shopping Centre.
Gay World Amusement Park (Happy World)
Initially christened Happy World in 1936, but later renamed in 1964, Gay World was the third and last of the “World” parks troika to open in 1937. Owned by George Lee Geok Eng – a businessman – it occupied a 10 acre plot of land at the junction of Geylang Road and Mountbatten Road. Similar to the two other parks, Gay World also had the conventional food stalls, open air cinemas, game booths, and performances that catered to families with children.

But what set the park apart was the sheer immensity of its premises to accommodate a covered stadium of 7000-capacity that could play host to boxing matches and sports competitions ; an oval-shaped cabaret hall; theatres for Chinese, Malay and Tamil shows; and an open-air cinema that could seat 300. New World’s trajectory, however, also headed in the same direction as its other two counterparts: after its post war recovery as a gambling den, patrons continued to throng the park until new entertainment options cropped up, stealing away customers.
Within a span of nearly three decades, Gay World was also ravaged by fire nearly seven times, maiming several of its main attractions. In 2000, the premises’ tenants were given notice to vacate. The Gay World indoor stadium, renamed Geylang Indoor Stadium and managed by the Singapore Sports Council, continued to operate at the site until its 2001 demolition  alongside the park.
Wonderland Amusement Park
As the popularity of the ‘three worlds’ waned, Wonderland Amusement Park blossomed. Opening in 1969 at Kallang, it was built on reclaimed land that shared boundaries with the old Kallang Airport. Along with being an entertainment venue for children and adults, the park also played host to plenty of festival and corporate events such as ‘Family Day’. 
Wonderland was known for its popular cup-and-saucer carousel that let carnival-goers sit in giant spinning cups for a dizzy ride. Emblazoned with Ovaltine advertisements about cocoa-flavoured beverage , the cups allowed thrill-seekers to spin faster by twisting a wheel in the centre of the cup.
With its colourful umbrellas , kiddie train rides and rollercoasters, Wonderland was a place for children of the 70s to spend many of their halcyon childhood days. By 1988 however, due to a frequent unavailability of amusement rides, the park ceased its operations. The land the park sat on was developed into the present day open air car park serving Kallang Indoor Stadium.
Big Splash Theme Park

Big Splash, the legendary waterpark at East Coast Park, was well known for its towering rainbow coloured slides. Opened in 1977, it featured an 85-metre long water slide that claimed to be the highest and longest in the world at that time. The largest pool was reported to be able to accommodate 1,380 people and all the other pools in the complex were filled with sea water and had sandy bottoms to simulate the impression of a beach. Other than its slide attraction, Big Splash also featured other facilities like an open-air theatre, a restaurant, food kiosks, and an arcade.  Despite its initial success, the park’s popularity began to decline at the turn of the century.

In 2002, the park closed for a four-month facelift, later reopening with new facilities such as a bicycle kiosk and a dive school. In 2006, it closed for further development, reopening two years later in 2008 with the water slides dismantled and the rest of the compound refurbished into a dining and lifestyle destination. At present, the park now known as Playground at Big Splash, is home to a smorgasbord of dining options instead – from fast food outlets and casual cafes, to posh restaurants and bars, alongside an inline skating school, mini-golf course and gym.

The troupe was led by two voluntary instructors Mr Lim Hiang Ghee (林香仪) and Mr Chan Yew Ham（陈耀钦）who were veteran professional circus acrobatic cycling performers during the 1930s-1940s.
From the 1950s to 1980s, the troupe trained more than a hundred acrobatic cyclists, and on average the troupe had eight to ten performances every year. It was during the 1980s, that the troupe enjoyed its peak and was invited to perform in national events such as the National Day Parade, Chingay procession, charity shows as well as many other school and community events.
The Kong Chow Clan Acrobatic Cycling Troupe was formed in 1957 and was well known for their acrobatic cycling stunts and performances.

The troupe had an impressive repertoire of up to 20 acrobatic cycling stunts involving unicycles and bicycles. These stunts included “A Single Dragon” (一条龙), ” Crossing Three Obstacles” (过三关) and “Cycling around in Bagua Diagram” ( 走八卦).

However, the troupe’s most challenging and most popular stunt was the “Pile-Up Arts” (叠罗汉) which involved 9 members “stacking-up” from a single rider on the bicycle. As a result of its success, the troupe and its acrobatic cycling routines became the Kong Chow Clan’s pride and icon as it was a troupe that was unique to the clan.

During the early 1980s, as a result of the global success of the movie “E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial” and its bike riding scenes, many youths in Singapore were inspired to take up acrobatic cycling. As a result, by 1984, there were up to 50 acrobatic cycling troupes or teams all across Singapore and professional acrobatic cyclists from Kong Chow Clan started teaching and sharing their skills with these troupes or teams.
However, the acrobatic cycling trend did not last as Singaporean youths started gravitating towards new trends such as break-dancing and by the 1990s, the acrobatic cycling troupe in Kong Chow Clan was disbanded.
Mr. Chia Kum Loke (谢锦乐), age 74, is one of the pioneer members of the acrobatic cycling troupe. He was only 15 years old when he joined Kong Chow Clan and started practicing Chinese martial arts and lion dance at the clan. As a result of his youth, fitness and bravery, he was always selected to be the person to climb to the top during the “Pile-up Arts” routine. Since then, Mr. Chia learned all of the acrobatic cycling routines and imparted the routines to new members of the troupe.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2016
At the heart of the Singapore River sits the myth of the Singapore Stone and strongman Badang, a mysterious legend from Singapore's past found in the Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), a chronicle of the Malay courts of Singapore and Melaka from the 14th and 16th centuries.
Fragment of the Singapore Stone currently on display at the National Museum of Singapore, 10th to 14th century. Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
Most Singaporeans are probably unfamiliar with the story of the Singapore Stone, and I myself was no exception. With the popularisation of Western stories such as fairy tales from the Grimm Brothers, Singapore's rich cultural reservoir of folklore and legends might seem to pale in comparison. They are, however, worthy of holding their own. Many other notable folk stories are also found in the Sejarah Melayu, such as the legend of Bukit Merah, as well as the founding of Singapura by Sang Nila Utama.
Manuscript version of the Sejarah Melayu, 1896; the earliest known version was written in 1612. Collection of the National Museum of Singapore.
Folklore is not only a great source of entertainment, but also provides insight into the culture, traditions, values and even language of the kingdom that called this land home before us. To me, it is fascinating that a physical piece of this nearly five hundred-year-old legend still survives, yet its stories are not already common knowledge to us. They story of the Singapore Stone holds important clues to what life was like in Singapura before Raffles, and allows us to extend our knowledge and appreciation of the very long journey that our island has traversed. The possibility of Singapore having its own local ancient tales worth retelling spurred me to find out more about the myths surrounding this mysterious stone and Badang.
The Strongman Badang
The earliest record of the story of strongman Badang can be found in the Sejarah Melayu, which is still considered a fundamental text of Malay history today.
According to one version of the folklore, Badang was a slave who worked to clear the forest for his owner. One day, Badang caught a genie in his fishing net at the Singapore River and the genie agreed to grant Badang one wish in exchange for his release. Thinking it would help him in his work, Badang asked to be the strongest man in the land. The genie told Badang that he had to eat his vomit if he wanted strength, so Badang ate the genie's vomit and became very strong. He was even able to uproot trees effortlessly.

Badang's immense strength caught the attention of King Seri Rana Wikrama and he was eventually summoned to court and appointed the commander-in-chief of the army. His strength also drew the attention of other regional leaders such as one of the kings in India, who sent his country's own champion, Nadi Bijaya Pikrama, to the Malay Archipelago to compete with Badang. The winner of the duel would be the one who could lift a large rock in front of the palace. Nadi managed to lift the stone up before dropping it. Badang lifted up the stone and flung it towards the Singapore River, where it lay for a very long time and became known as the Singapore Stone.

THE SINGAPORE STONE
The Singapore Stone once stood at the mouth of the Singapore River. The huge sandstone was believed to span three metres in both height and width. One the face of the slab were 50 lines of inscription measuring 1.5 metres in height and 2.1 metres in width. The inscription, which could hold secrets to Singapore's history, is in Kawi script and contains some Sanskrit words, but has not been fully deciphered. The Stone has been dated from the 10th to the 14th century, and is believed to be the oldest record of writing found in Singapore.
Drawings of three fragments from the Singapore Stone, from Laidlay's 1848 article in the Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal. The last fragment (labelled Fig 3) is now on display at the National Museum of Singapore.
In 1843, the British blew up the Stone to build Fort Fullerton and colonial living quarters. Only one of the three fragments of the stone remains, measuring about 74cm in width. This is currently on display at the National Museum of Singapore and will be featured in this year's National Day Parade.
Preserving Our Heritage
The legend of the Singapore Stone serves as a reminder that economic development and modernity does not have to come at the expense of our history. As Singapore steps into the next 50 years of her independence, we write new chapters where heritage and advancement co-exist and complement each other. While the Singapore Stone and the story of Badang still has a fragment that stands testimony to their legacy, we may not be as fortunate regarding other local folklore and traditions. Hence, it is up to us, the people of Singapore, to preserve and pass down these Singapore stories to future generations to better appreciate our history and heritage.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2016
Radio, when it first arrived, produced a unique acoustic space and created a new aural experience. Like other colonial technologies such as the gramophone and cinema, it created a new and distinct form of entertainment in Singapore. Besides broadening people’s imagination, radio also created a vast community – one that crossed the boundaries of age, ethnicity, gender and nationality.
In 2016, the National Museum of Singapore's exhibition Celebrating Radio: Sounds from the Past thematically charted some of the significant phases of Singapore's broadcasting history, from 1930s to 1980s. The audience was treated to a rich soundscape comprising live commentaries, folk theatre, jingles, music, slogans, stories and speeches, which complemented the narrative.
Listening to the radio was a common pastime for children from the 1950s to 1970s. Children’s programmes included educational storytelling, song dedications, radio plays and live performances by young artists. In a specially designed interactive space within the exhibition, children entered the immersive environment of a broadcasting room. Engaging through imagination and drama, children could role-play a radio broadcaster, read stories aloud and make song dedications. Outside the broadcasting room, parents and children could design their own vinyl records or make vintage radio boxes for a donation of $2. They could also try their hand at creating sound effects.
Amateur Experiments (1930s to 1940s)
Radio broadcasting in Malaya began as an amateur, experimental and private endeavour. In Singapore, there were the Amateur Wireless Society of Malaya (1924 to 1928) and Radio Service Company of Malaya’s ZHI (1933 to 1936). Besides news bulletins and talks, the ZHI broadcasted both gramophone and live music from local dance halls.
Invented in 1877, the phonograph or gramophone is a device that allows both the recording and reproduction of sound. Pictured here is a phonograph produced by the Aeolian Company. These Aeolian phonographs usually came with a patented feature – the graduola, a cable that allowed the volume to be controlled from a distance.

With the government’s decision to issue broadcasting licenses, radio services became more structured and regulated. The British Malaya Broadcasting Corporation (BMBC), a private company based in Singapore, started medium wave transmission in 1937. However, the onset of World War II created another set of challenges.
Medium of Control (1940 to 1946)
Both the British and Japanese governments understood radio’s ability to reach large audiences. A new department to publicise Britain’s war efforts and dispel enemy claims was created in 1939. The government purchased BMBC in 1940, renamed it Malayan Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), and enhanced radio facilities.
The BMBC studios were located within the Cathay Building on Handy Road, which was designed by Frank Brewer. The building also housed a cinema, hotel and restaurant, and was Singapore's tallest building in the 1940s. Its history intersects with that of radio, as news about the advancing Japanese was announced from the BMBC studios. During the war, the Japanese took over the building and used it for its Broadcasting, Propaganda and Military Information departments.

During the Japanese Occupation (1942 to 1945), the function of radio changed. More than a source of power, it was also a medium to control the population. Radio became the chief means to spread the Japanese language, through which listeners were persuaded to accept the larger cultural superiority of Japan.

Radio for Developing Society (1946 to1959)
The nature of broadcasting in Singapore changed after British rule was restored. To fight threats from various insurgents, radio was used to spread political awareness, as well as inform and educate the wider population. Farther out, villages, estates and tin-mining areas began to experience radio. In 1946, the government formed the Pan-Malayan Department of Broadcasting, known on air as Radio Malaya. The Singapore-based station provided programmes for the entire Malay Peninsula. On January 1, 1959, the Singapore station was renamed Radio Singapura, while the Federation’s services continued to be known as Radio Malaya.
Radio and Nation Building (1959 to 1965)
Radio in postcolonial Singapore served as a stage for political theatre and facilitated nation building. The persuasive power and reach of the media was utilised by the edgling government under the People’s Action Party. As early as 1957, one of the Party’s founders, S. Rajaratnam, wrote a six-part radio play titled A Nation in the Making. This dialogue-based play was aired on Radio Malaya and articulated Rajaratnam’s views on Malayan identity.
n 1961, Singapore’s then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew wrote and delivered a series of 12 weekly talks on the topic of merger, which was broadcasted in English, Malay and Mandarin.

Radio was instrumental in educating listeners about Malay, the national language. Malay was meant to foster a common identity among Singaporeans. The Ministry of Culture published a multilingual booklet containing 16 lessons that were broadcast from April 11 to June 1, 1960.

After Singapore’s merger with Malaysia in 1963, broadcasting services were reorganised. Radio Malaysia was created, with its headquarters based in Kuala Lumpur, while Radio Singapura remained here. In that same year, Television Singapura was launched as Singapore’s first television station. After independence in 1965, Radio Singapura and Television Singapura merged to form Radio Television Singapura (RTS) as a department under the Ministry of Culture.
Voice of the Nation (1960s to1980s)
Radio played a major role in shaping postcolonial Singapore. The multilingual nature of radio programming in Singapore strengthened vernacular traditions, particularly in drama and music. Programmes often highlighted local experiences and attempted to articulate the Singapore identity. Traditions such as storytelling were also facilitated by radio. Several well-known Rediffusion storytellers turned the dramatisation of written text into a fine art. Rediffusion (Singapore) Pte Ltd started its services in 1949, broadcasting entertainment materials in Malay, English, Mandarin and Chinese dialects.

In order to generate finances for broadcasting, commercial advertising was introduced in 1960. In 1980, RTS was renamed Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC). As a statutory board, SBC was tasked with providing information, education and entertainment. Radio services were augmented to include FM stereo services, a new Radio Programmes Division and programming adapted to nine channels in English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.
Transistor Radios
Transistor radios altered the way radios were used. While large radios encouraged families to gather and listen to programmes together, portable transistors were sources of personalised leisure. As mass produced items, they were affordable. Compact radios with simple controls and attractive casings became favoured consumer items. This was until portable cassette and CD players that offered better sound quality emerged in the 1980s.

Radio and Popular Music
Broadcasting both local and international music, radio in Singapore inspired many to make music. Their songs were in turn popularised on the radio, producing several local celebrities. One of the most successful local shows was Radio Malaya’s Talentime. First aired in 1949 and hosted by Kingsley Morrando, the show became a popular platform for local talent. In the 1950s, the popularity of radio and the invention of the electric guitar in America introduced listeners in Singapore to jazz, rhythm and blues, swing, and rock and roll. Listening to these musical styles encouraged young people to create local bands and produce original content.

Singapore's Healthcare System in the 1800s
From the 1800s to the first half of the 1900s, traditional medical practices as well as home remedies were the primary means of healthcare for non-European communities in Singapore. During this period, the Chinese sought medical treatment from sinsehs (traditional Chinese physicians), the Malays from bomohs or dukans (shamans) while the Indians relied on Ayurvedic medicine.
Western medical practices arrived in Singapore in 1819 when Thomas Prendergast, a Sub-Assistant Surgeon, landed on the island with Sir Stamford Raffles. Joined later by William Montgomerie, an Assistant Surgeon, the two men attended to the medical needs of the European community and their troops. The appointment of the first rural health officer in the late 1830s marked the beginning of organised public health services in Singapore.
In October 1830, Thomas Oxley was appointed Assistant Surgeon in Singapore, and was head of the medical department from 1844 to 1857. The Municipal Health Department was subsequently established in 1887 to manage the increased need for health services within the city area, and the Rural and Urban Health Authorities was established in 1896 to oversee sanitation and the administration of health laws. In 1890, the Straits Medical Association was established by Sir Dr David James Galloway for local medical practitioners to discuss and conduct research on local diseases.
The first steps toward the prevention and control of infectious diseases were adopted by the British government in the 1860s through the introduction of laws on vaccination, quarantine and registration of births and deaths. In 1868, the Vaccination Ordinance was enacted and smallpox vaccination was made compulsory with effect from 1 May 1869. Yet, public health measures were still inadequate at the turn of the century and the rate of mortality in Singapore remained high.

This is a portrait of Dr W R C Middleton who served as Singapore's Municipal Health Officer (1893 to 1920). He did much to improve the living conditions then and curtail the spreading of serious diseases as cholera.


Early Hospitals in Singapore
The Singapore General Hospital (then known as the General Hospital) (SGH) is the first hospital built on the island and started as a humble wooden shed in a British military camp in the vicinity of Bras Basah Road and Stamford Road. Through the years, the hospital relocated to several sites and underwent several name changes before finally settling at its present location at Outram Road during the 1880s.
Known as See Pai Poh (施排埔) amongst the Chinese community, it was rebuilt twice on the same site during the 1900s. Officially opened on 29 March 1926 by Sir Lawrence Nunns Gullemard, then Governor of the Straits Settlement, SGH was the only hospital back then that had ""Singapore"" in its name which affirmed its status as the country's premier hospital.
In addition to SGH, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) is another of Singapore's oldest hospitals and was initially known as the Chinese Pauper Hospital. The foundation stone for the first TTSH building was laid on Pearl's Hill on 25 May 1844 after Tan Tock Seng, a wealthy businessman, contributed 5,000 dollars to fund its construction cost. TTSH shifted locations thrice before moving to its current site at Jalan Tan Tock Seng.
Kandang Kerbau (KK) Woman’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) started in 1858 with the establishment of the fifth General Hospital in Kandang Kerbau. For more than six decades, KKH served different purposes and underwent several name changes before it finally became a maternity hospital in 1924. From the 1950s to the 1970s, KKH was the world's busiest maternity hospital and achieved a historical high of 39,835 deliveries in 1966.

The hospital started off in 1819 as a shed in the cantonment near Bras Basah Road and Stamford Road to provide medical attention to the early inhabitants of Singapore.





Other Healthcare Institutions in the 1800s
Singapore's first maternity hospital opened on 1 January 1888 at the junction of Victoria Street and Stamford Canal with a capacity of eight beds. It was replaced by the new Maternity Block at the General Hospital which commenced operations in 1908, and subsequently re-opened as the Free Maternity Hospital in 1914. The hospital closed down on 1 October 1924 on the day KKH opened its doors.
Built in 1841, the Insane Hospital was the first psychiatric facility in Singapore and it started with 30 beds. Located at the junction of Bras Basah Road and Bencoolen Street, the hospital grew to accommodate 130 males and 1 female by 1860. In 1861, the hospital moved to a site near the fifth General Hospital in Kandang Kerbau and was renamed Lunatic Asylum. The asylum relocated to a 300 bed facility at Sepoy Lines in 1887 following a cholera outbreak at the previous asylum and the new asylum was renamed New Lunatic Asylum.
In addition to public healthcare institutions, there were other private non-profit healthcare institutions such as Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution (formerly known as Thong Chai Yee Say). Established in 1867 by a group of Chinese immigrants to provide free medical treatment for the needy, the institution is the oldest Chinese medical institution in Singapore. It originally operated out of rented shophouse at 31 Upper Pickering Street before relocating to 50 Eu Tong Sen Street in 1892 and subsequently to a new 10 storey building at Chin Swee Road in 1976.
Former Thong Chai Medical Institution
Home to the first free traditional Chinese medical clinic for the poor in Singapore, the Former Thong Chai Medical Institution testifies to the Chinese pioneers’ spirit of mutual assistance and their generosity towards the poor and needy.




Singapore's Healthcare System from 1900 to pre-1965
The colonial government introduced a series of healthcare services in the early 1900s and these included the Maternal and Child Health Service in 1907, the School Health Service in 1921 and Singapore's first public dental clinic in 1929. However, traditional medicine and medical practices remained the primary means of healthcare for the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities during the first half of the 1900s.
During the 1940s, the development of Singapore's healthcare system was disrupted by the World War II and the Japanese Occupation. In the early post-war years, malnourishment was rife, infant mortality rate was high and infectious diseases continued to be widespread. The colonial government, however, acted expediently to restore the public health system and the health of the general population gradually returned to pre-war levels by the late 1940s.
The colonial government also approved a 10-year Medical Plan formulated by Dr W J Vickers (then Director of Medical Services) in 1948. The priorities outlined in the aforementioned plan included the establishment of more maternity and child clinics; the expansion and modernisation of hospitals; the development of school clinics; and mass immunisation against infectious diseases. In 1950, a notable advancement in health measures on the islands off Singapore was made with the launch of a floating dispensary.
Following the attainment of self-governance in 1959, all medical and health services in Singapore were reorganised and unified under the administration of the Ministry of Health in 1961. In 1962, the government introduced mandatory immunisation against diphtheria and other nationwide immunisation exercises included the anti-tuberculosis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination for newborns in 1957.

Healthcare Institutions and Associations in Early Singapore
The 1900s witnessed the establishment of several military hospitals in Singapore and they included Alexandra Hospital (formerly known as British or Alexandra Military Hospital) (1940); Sembawang Hospital (formerly known as Naval Base Hospital) (late 1920s to early 1930s); and Changi Hospital (formerly known as Royal Air Force Hospital) (1935). It is worthwhile to note that at the time Alexandra Hospital was established, it was the largest and best-equipped hospital in the British Far East Command.
In addition to military hospitals, a number of public and private hospitals were established during this period. Examples of public hospitals established then included Toa Payoh Hospital (formerly known as Thomson Road Hospital) in 1959 and Middle Road Hospital in 1945 while examples of private hospitals included Gleneagles Hospital (1959) and Parkway East Hospital (1930s).
Located at Yio Chu Kang, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) (formerly known as the Mental Hospital) was established in 1928 and replaced the New Lunatic Asylum. In 1951, the hospital was renamed as Woodbridge Hospital in an attempt to remove the stigma associated with mentally ill patients. In 1993, the hospital moved to Buangkok View and it was renamed as IMH to reflect its emphasis on research, training and mental health education.
It was also during the 1900s that a number of non-profit healthcare institutions were established, and examples included St Andrew's Mission Hospital (1923) which started as a dispensary for women and children; Mount Alvernia Hospital (1961) which was founded by a group of nuns from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood; and the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (1910) which was founded by a group of Cantonese merchants to provide free medical care to Cantonese immigrants.

Singapore's Healthcare System post-1965
After Singapore attained independence in 1965, the government continued to step up its efforts to improve the quality of healthcare on the island. It was during this period that Western medicine and medical practices gradually overtook traditional medicine and medical practices as the primary means of healthcare and the majority of the population.
In addition, many nationwide health campaigns were introduced to address the country’s health issues, and these campaigns included the Family Planning Campaign and the Dental Health Campaign launched during the 1960s, National Heart Week in the 1970s and the National Smoking Control Programme in the 1980s.
The Family Planning Campaign was a three-month campaign launched to raise awareness of the need for family planning and the disadvantages of large unplanned families. Its slogan of ""Two is Enough"" is well remembered by Singaporeans born in the 1970s (or earlier) and it was so effective that fertility rate in Singapore fell from over four children per female in 1965 to less than two in the 1980s.
The Dental Health Campaign was launched in 1969 and as part of the campaign, students were supplied with a toothbrush and a plastic mug (for 25 cents) and compulsory brushing of teeth was introduced in all primary schools (usually after recess and conducted along drains) to inculcate in students the habit of brushing teeth daily using proper techniques.
During this period, a number of public and private hospitals were also established. The former included the National University Hospital (1985) which continues to serve as the principal teaching hospital for the National University of Singapore's medical and dental faculties while the latter included Mount Elizabeth Hospital (1979), one of the largest private hospitals in Singapore, and the former Thomson Medical Centre (1979) (now known as Thomson Medical Pte Ltd).
Singapore's first comprehensive National Health Plan which outlined a preventive approach towards health management was introduced in 1983. At the heart of the plan was Medisave, the first of its kind in the world, which was implemented in 1984. The scheme is a compulsory national savings scheme that requires each Singaporean working adult to set aside a part of his/her income to meet future medical expenses.
The government also started the journey of restructuring all public hospitals in Singapore during the 1980s to grant hospitals greater autonomy in delivering improved services to patients in an efficient manner.

Singapore's Healthcare System: 1990s and Beyond
During the 1990s, the White Paper titled ""Affordable Health Care"" was introduced to address the issue of escalating healthcare costs and to serve as a blueprint for developing Singapore's healthcare system for the 21st century.
The 1900s and 2000s also saw the introduction of MediSave (1984), MediShield (1990) and MediShield Plus (1994) which are key components of the national medical insurance scheme. Medifund (1993) and Medifund Silver (2007), both endowment funds targeted to help Singaporeans who do not have enough money to pay for their medical expenses, were also launched as part of the government's public assistance schemes.
Unveiled in 2012, the Healthcare 2020 Master Plan encompasses a set of strategies to transform Singapore’s healthcare system so as to enhance the accessibility and quality of healthcare for all Singaporeans. These strategies include the reorganisation of the healthcare system into Regional Health Systems to provide integrated care and the introduction of outpatient team-based care for patients.
Major steps have also been taken since 2012 to keep healthcare affordable. These include the expansion of the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) to offer subsidised outpatient care at private General Practitioners (GPs) and dental clinics to middle and low-income Singaporeans aged 40 and above; and the introduction of the Pioneer Generation Package which offers healthcare benefits for Singapore's pioneers.

Public Hospitals and Specialist Centres
Changi General Hospital (CGH) was opened in 1998 and became Singapore's first purpose-built general hospital to serve communities in the east and northeast regions. It replaced the Changi Hospital and Toa Payoh Hospital, both of which ceased operations in early 1997. During the mid-2000s, CGH became the first regional general hospital which had a community hospital, St Andrew Community Hospital, located next to it.
Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, opened in 2010, is another regional general hospital ""twinned"" with the Yishun Community Hospital and focuses on serving the northern region of Singapore. Likewise, the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital is be the regional hospital for the Jurong area and it is ""twinned"" with the Jurong Community Hospital.
As part of the Healthcare 2020 Master Plan announced in 2012, a number of new hospitals will be established over time to meet the projected long-term demand for healthcare services and these new hospitals include both Sengkang General Hospital and Sengkang Community Hospital as well as an integrated hospital hub with the Yishun Community Hospital, Admiralty Medical Centre and Woodlands Integrated Healthcare Campus (to be opened in phases from 2022).
In addition, to address the growing need for specialised treatments, a number of specialist centres were established and they included the Singapore National Eye Centre (1990), the Singapore Heart Centre (1994), the National Dental Centre (1997), the National Neuroscience Institute (1999) and the National Cancer Centre Singapore (2000).

BeMuse Volume 6 Issued 2 - Jul to Sep 2013
""It's a bright and early morning at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and I am going about my usual fieldwork when I hear a ruckus going on at a nearby tree. Walking over, I see a flurry of activity: long-tailed macaques are hopping from branch to branch, plantain squirrls are scurrying about, and a variety of birds are flocking to a great big tree that is covered with thousands of small, red, juicy fruit. It's a feeding frenzy, and the host?""
- A Fabulous Fig Tree

Figs (or Ficus as this group of trees are known in Latin to botanists) are often touted as ""keystone species"", which means that these trees play a disproportionately large role in the lives of many creatures in an ecosystem. One key reason for this significance is that fig trees provide food for a great number of other animals in the forest. One research study has found that over 1,270 species of mammals and birds, as well as a number of reptiles and fish, feed on figs to varying degrees (Shanahan et al. 2001). In addition, many other tropical rainforest trees are seasonal, producing fruit only in certain months or even certain years, whereas figs bear fruit all-year round, thus providing reliable and nutritious source of food for forest-dwelling birds and other beasts.
A fruit with a long history
Wild figs have existed for millions of years but their use in agriculture by our ancestors appears to have originated as far back as 11,400 years ago in the Near East. This was established in 2006 by archaeologists from Israel and the United States who found the remnants of dried figs at an archaeological site in the Jordan Valley (Kislev et al. 2006). Their discovery, which was published in the journal Science, suggests that figs were being used in agriculture even before olives and grapes, making them the oldest cultivated fruits to date
Most figs that are cultivated by mankind are varieties of a single species, Ficus carica, also known as the Common Fig. The name carica comes from Caria, a region in Asia Minor that is now part of Turkey. Turkey is the world’s large producer of figs, accounting for approximately 27% of the total production of figs, followed by Egypt, then the USA. In Asia, figs are cultivated in Japan and China, but these are mostly retained for the domestic market. The cultivation of figs and the recognition of their nutritious quality have helped spread the fig far and wide. Today, figs are found wherever the weather permits and are cultivated in regions outside their native range like France and California

Trees that depend on tiny wasps
Despite their widespread cultivation and popularity as culinary treats, few people are aware that aside from Ficus carica, there are more than 700 species of figs worldwide. Approximately 500 species can be found in Australasia, making this region the most diverse for figs. Some of the most well-known local trees are figs; readers are surely familiar with Banyans or Strangler Figs (Ficus benjamina or Ficus microcarpa), which begin life as tiny seeds deposited on the branch of another, already mature, tree by a passing bird. The fig sapling then sprouts and sends down roots towards the ground. These aerial roots, which confer a rather spooky atmosphere to these figs, later thicken and ‘strangle’ the host tree, which dies off. The Banyan that remains forms a thick canopy with a dense latticework of roots, which provide ample habitat for other plants and animals. In the ruins of the Angkor Wat complex in Cambodia, large strangler figs have taken over some temple compounds, their roots enveloping the ancient stone walls and gopurams with a layer of living wood.
Another little-known fact about figs is that these magnificent, life-giving trees are completely dependent on tiny wasps measuring just a few millimetres in length, which are the only insects able to successfully pollinate their flowers. These fig wasps are very different from the hornets and other social wasps that visit flowers in parks and gardens and nest in elaborate hives; fig wasps do not feed as adults, lack stings and are totally harmless to humans; in fact, without fig wasps, we would have no figs at all.
Figs and fig wasps share what is known to ecologists as a reciprocal obligate mutualism. This means that both partners cannot reproduce without the other. The relationship is made more complex by the fact that approximately two-thirds of all fig species have a one-to-one relationship whereby each species of fig tree can only be pollinated by a single species of fig wasp. Thus, the extinction of the pollinator would mean the extinction of its associated fig tree as well.
The Chinese refer to figs as ‘Wu hua guo’ or ‘flowerless fruit’, a name which aptly describes the distinctive reproductive features of figs. Instead of showy flowers that bloom in the open from the tips of branches, figs produce an enclosed receptacle that is full of hundreds of tiny individual florets. This receptacle, called the syconium, is often thought to be the fruit, but it is not a fruit until pollination has taken place.
At the bottom of this receptacle, keen observers will see a tiny entrance called the ostiole. This hole serves to allow the female fig wasp to enter the syconium. She then proceeds to simultaneously pollinate the fig and lay her eggs. Her offspring, when they finally emerge as adults, will then mate with each other within the syconium. The male wasps die after mating, but the mated female will exit the syconium via the ostiole, carrying pollen on her body as she flies off to find other figs of the same species. When she reaches and enters a new syconium, the pollen on her body fertilises the fig and the life-cycles of both tree and wasp are repeated. In the meantime, the pollinated florets in the syconium will ripen and turn the receptacle into a delectable fruit enjoyed by humans and frugivorous animals. In short, the fig tree provides a nest for the offspring of the fig wasp, and in return the fig wasp pollinates the flowers of the fig. It is a mutualism that has lasted over 60 millions years and ensured the survival of both groups of organisms.
Cut into half, the Golden Hairy Fig (Ficus aurata) shows a fig wasp making its way around the florets in the syconium. As the fig wasp wanders inside the fig, she picks up pollen which will pollinate other figs she visits. Photo by author.
These tiny wasps with long ovipositors (Philotrypesis sp.) are not pollinators but parasitic wasps whose young outcompete the larvae of pollinating fig wasps. Photo by author.
In Singapore, figs are the second large genus of woody plants with 48 recorded native species, of which 32 (66%) are considered critically endangered or nationally extinct (Chong et al. 2009). This is largely the result of deforestation, which has replaced nearly all of the island’s original vegetation with urban spaces that support only a handful of hardy fig species such as Banyans. Another, more pervasive, threat to the survival of all species of figs is the possibility that their tiny pollinators will go extinct. A study carried out by my colleagues and myself using four species of fig wasps found in Singapore suggests that climate warming may not bode well for the short-lived tiny pollinators, as the projected increases in temperature expected for the tropics may shorten the lifespan of fig wasps by 33-60%. (Jevanandam et al. 2013). For an insect that already has a brief adult lifespan of just 1-2 days, this means a drastic reduction in the time it has to mate, locate a suitable fig, lay eggs and pollinate the florets. Over time, the reduction or absence of pollination services would lead to fewer ripe figs, and in turn both urban and wild animals may be adversely affected as they would lose a valuable source of food.
Figs in culture and cultivation
Unlike animals in the wild, people are luckier since most of the appetising figs that end up in our stores and on our plates are parthenocarpic, which means that the fig ripens on its own without pollination. Most of the figs commercially cultivated in California are of this type, while those in the Middle East are a combination of wasp-pollinated and parthenocarpic cultivars.
Due to their sweetness, nutritious value and abundant crops, figs play an important role as a food resource in many cultures around the world. Dried figs are an excellent source of minerals, vitamins and anti-oxidants. In fact, dried fruits are concentrated sources of energy, with each 100 grams of dried figs providing approximately 249 calories. Fresh figs, on the other hand, contain antioxidants such as vitamins A, E, and K. Both dried and fresh figs have a high calcium content and rank second after oranges in terms of calcium content in fruits.
Even today, figs continue to play an important role in food and nutrition. This is most evident during the month of Ramadan when Muslims from around the world including Singapore break their daily fast with a combination of figs, honey, dates, olives and bread.
In traditional Chinese medicine, dried figs are used as an ingredient in tonics to help strengthen the lungs and relieve coughs. In Western cuisine, dried figs are popular as healthy, energy-rich snacks like the fig newton, which is a widely consumed pastry roll filled with fig paste. Figs are also made into jams, preserves, biscuits and confections such as Turkish baklava. The dried leaves of one native fig, Ficus auriculata, can be used to make a medicinal tea
The fig’s significance does not just end with it being an easy-to-consume, nutritious food. These trees also have a strong religious significance in the East. It is said that Buddha found enlightenment while meditating under a Bodhi Tree, which is believed to be Ficus religiosa, a fig native to India but which has been introduced to Singapore. And so throughout countries where Buddhism prevails, like India, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Singapore, figs are revered and often planted as a religious symbol and worshiped in the absence of proper temples. When I was travelling in Thailand, a number of restaurants I dined at had a pressed leaf of Ficus religiosa on the first page of their menus, an indication of the deep-seated religious significance the fig tree holds in Thai culture.

But the bold, ubiquitous fig doesn’t hold back and has ventured beyond Islam and Buddhism into Christianity. It has been argued by some scholars that the forbidden fruit, which Adam and Eve consumed in the Garden of Eden, was the fig and not the apple. And that the leaves of the fig were used to cover Adam and Eve when they realised that they were naked. The most famous depiction of the fig as the forbidden fruit was painted by the Italian artist Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) in his masterpiece fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.
Figs in various forms
Not all figs grow to become massive trees like the Banyan or Bodhi. Figs exhibit different growth forms that include climbers, shrubs, average-sized trees and large trees which reach well above the canopy. Many of these forms are found in Singapore. One large native fig tree is the Common Red Stem Fig (Ficus variegata), which can grow up to 40 metres high and is found mainly in parks and nature reserves. There is one specimen in the Botanic Gardens growing near the visitor centre, which can be recognised by the bright red figs growing in clusters from the trunk. Another native fig species, Ficus punctata, is a woody climber that can be found extensively along Holland Road on the side of Botanic Gardens. This species is easy to spot when it is figging as the figs look like oranges. A very common roadside shrub is the White-leaved Fig (Ficus grossu-larioides) which often attracts bulbuls, green pigeons, black-naped orioles and Asian koels among other birds. These species and more dot our urban landscape and provide sustenance for our urban fauna. As a result, the possible loss or reduced abundance of figs from the landscape should be of major conservation concern. Their value in our concrete jungle is perhaps most appreciated by local bird watchers and photographers who often flock to figging trees in anticipation of the huge variety of birds that visit these trees to feed.

Some of the figs found in Singapore are 120 to 160 years old as of 2013. Fortunately, the National Parks Board’s Heritage Tree Scheme, which began in 2001, identifies and conserves mature trees that are rare and have historical significance. There were 199 trees on the list in 2013, of which 34 were figs consisting of eight species. In particular, a 120-year old heritage fig tree at Sentosa Island was made a star when it received much media attention after being featured in a 2001 film, The Tree, starring popular local actress Zoe Tay.
And so it is, food, faith and controversy define the fig’s story, making it a ‘keystone’ in more ways than one. Like the roots of its own great Banyans, the magnificent Ficus in all its forms and habits has firmly intertwined itself into the lives of both people and wildlife. Given that more than half our 48 native species are endangered or extinct, no effort should be spared in conserving them. The next time you walk past a fig, take a moment to stop, observe the many birds, monkeys and squirrels that feast on its fruit, and appreciate how this natural bounty is the result of a complex yet fragile relationship with a tiny wasp that not many people have heard of and few have seen.
The Fabulous Figs of Singapore, which inspired this article’s title, is an excellent pocket book written by local fig enthusiasts. It provides a list of fig species found in Singapore with pictures, helpful descriptions and locations of notable trees. Available at good book stores, this is an informative little book I used when I first started out on my journey into the world of figs.

Sun, sand and palm trees have long defined Singapore's eastern coast. Before the extensive land reclamation project that began in the 1960s, the seashore was right outside many of the houses still seen today, including the popular Hua Yu Wee restaurant, which retains its original steps that used to lead to the beach.

The East Coast of the first half of the twentieth century was what we now know as Bedok and its surrounding areas. Singapore Memory Project contributor Bernard Han shares: “Before Marine Parade was reclaimed, the beach used to be along Marine Parade Road, just behind the courtyard of the Grand Hotel – a place where children could really grow up by the sea.”
Bedok was one of the earliest documented places in Singapore, as seen from a 1604 map referring to Sungei Bedok (Bedok River) as Sunebodo.

 As to how the name came about, one view is that it derives from the Malay word bedoh, a wooden drum formerly used to issue the Islamic call to prayer. Another links Bedok to the word biduk, a riverine fishing boat.
Example of a Malay bedoh. Collection of National Museum of Singapore.
Bedok grew around the river and the coast as a series of villages. Each village had its own unique story. Chai Chee’s name refers in Hokkien to a vegetable market, which is what it first began as. Heritage blogger Yeo Hong Eng remembers: “As soon as we moved there, acquaintances were forged. There was the fishmonger, Mr Lee Tng, from Chai Chee market... His well constantly supplied the neighbours with cool refreshing water. He invited us to use his well water which we did until we got portable pipe water.”
Kampong Bedok was situated at the crossroads of Bedok Road and Upper East Coast Road and is an area still affectionately known as Bedok Corner. Ronald Ho, who was born there, shares his memories: “It was the best days of my life living in Bedok Village... we owned nothing of luxury but we led a most colourful childhood. From climbing trees searching for fruits to attempting to swim in the sand mines at Koh Sek Lim Road, our afternoons were never lonely or dull.”

Bedok of the past included Siglap, which also comes from the Malay word si-gelap (“dark one”), likely refering to either an eclipse at the time of its founding or the thick canopy of coconut trees in the area. The village’s founder was Tok Lasam, believed to be an Indonesian royal fleeing from the Dutch. Today his tombstone is located in Siglap. Mrs Rita Fernando speaks of her experiences living in the village: “For us, I would say there really was no difference in race. We did not even think of ourselves as Singaporeans then, because we were just emerging from colonial rule. We just lived as kampong people and neighbours and we shared whatever we had.”
Tanah Merah, also part of the larger Bedok in the past, literally means “red cliffs” in Malay, referring to the seaside cliffs of reddish clay-like soil that characterised the area. Heritage blogger Jerome Lim reflects: “Marked by a landscape that would seem out of place in the Singapore of today with its terrain that undulated with cliffs that overlooked the sea, the area was decorated with gorgeous seaside villas and attap-roofed wooden huts of coastal villages that provided a laidback feel to the surroundings...” In stark contrast, the Tanah Merah area was also fortified with artillery guns and pillboxes from which soldiers could shoot enemies approaching from the sea.

Surviving fragments of old seawalls tell of the evolution of the east’s character and physical landscape. Two of these seawalls can be found behind Elliot Walk and along Nallur Road today, indicating the former coastline. As Bedok was close to the sea, it was not surprising that many made their living from this water- side advantage. Fishermen would haul their catch of local fish such as scad, wolf herring and mackerel from the shore to Siglap Market for sale. Others toiled the land, farming tapioca, vegetables, and collecting coconut and nipah palms. Harvests were then transported via old Changi Road to nearby Chai Chee for sale.

Along these low-lying areas, floods however were a frequent occurrence. Former Siglap resident Felicia Goh shares: “Whenever there were heavy showers, we would have to watch out for floods and bring our furniture to the second floor. It was fun for us kids as we could play water officially!”

Fire, too, did not spare these areas. In a 1962 blaze, 500 Siglap residents saw their kampong ravaged by flames on Chinese New Year’s day – the result of firecrackers landing on flammable attap roofs. Long-time resident Goh Chiang Siang shared that affected families had to be resettled to temporary housing nearby. Former bank officer Aloysius Leo De Conceicao also recalled how the neighbouring kampongs united to put out the fire: “I remember everybody from the neighbourhood came out to help the fire brigade and firemen because they had a bit of difficulty getting the water. It was sad because it was during the festive season.”

Seaside and water activities were part of the area’s recreational highlights. Bedok Beach (the coastal stretch from Upper East Coast Road to Bedok Corner) was the site of holiday accommodations and restaurants. This lifestyle was enjoyed by residents and visitors from across the island and even overseas, who visited the beach for picnics, recreational fishing, swimming and kolek (small wooden boat of regional origin) racing. Dance parties by the beach were said to have been organised for all to enjoy. Writing in The Straits Times in 1978, T. F. Hwang shares: “I remember the early 1950s where the annual Bedok-Siglap boat races were major pesta [“carnival” in Malay] events, culminating at the end of the day in Bedok with community joget [a dance of Malaccan origin], dancing under coconut trees by the sandy beach.”

In the 1960s, land scarcity prompted the government to embark on major land reclamation exercises. The extensive East Coast Reclamation Scheme, which commenced in 1966, was undertaken by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) as its largest venture at that time. Hills at Siglap, Bedok and Tampines were levelled using fully mechanised bucket wheel excavators and an automated conveyer belt transported the sand to the reclamation site. This project eventually added 1,525 hectares of land stretching from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu. It aimed to combine high density housing development with commercial and industrial interests in one area.

By the 1970s, kampongs began to make way for modern flats and industrial parks, and villagers were offered new flats in surrounding areas. At the time, Chai Chee was the only urban residential estate in the otherwise still rural, eastern region of Singapore. Mah Eng Siong, one of Chai Chee’s first residents, recalls: “By then, our family house (in the kampong) was very crowded. There were a lot of problems with so many people living so close together. It felt good to move to my own house.”

Completed in the early 1980s, Bedok New Town was one of the new generation HDB towns that was planned as a total living environment. Residents, largely former farmers and fishermen, were also able to find new employment with big industrial companies like Matsushita, Hitachi and Fuji, whose factories were located in the area. Bedok’s connectivity with the rest of Singapore increased with the completion of the 36-kilometre Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) in 1980 linking both ends of the island.
Bedok resident Keith Tan remembers moving into a high-rise at in Bedok South: “When we first moved, I was excited – you get to see such a nice view over the east coast.” Resident Mahat Bin Ariffin, also appreciated the comforts of the new flats: “It’s a most convenient town, particularly for me because I work at the airport... You can really get a good night’s sleep here. There are no mosquitoes!”
While older residents recall the kampong days, the younger generation has fond memories of the stretch of East Coast created through land reclamation. Singapore Memory Project contributor Cassandra Lee recounts: “To me, my neighbourhood constitutes of ECP (East Coast Park) because the route towards it holds a very special place in my heart. I will always remember my cycling trips with my dad... On those weekly Sunday trips, I would cycle behind my dad, taking in all the sights and sounds from our house to ECP. Sometimes, we would cycle as far as we could, until we were exhausted. It was fun and a great adventure for a kid.”

Development of the area continues, with HDB’s Remaking Our Heartlands (ROH) project that has once again transformed the Bedok town centre through an integrated complex, redeveloped hawker centre, sporting facilities, and a town plaza that includes a heritage corner supported by the National Heritage Board.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/playground-paradise/story,"TL;DR
A child can never really run out of outdoor play options in sunny Singapore. Over a century, the island nation has gone from no designated play areas for children whatsoever to having one of the highest densities of playgrounds in the world.1

All work and no play makes…
Given the mercantile priorities of the colony, designing the city for children was low on the list for the British. So how and where did children play? In the congested city centre, they carved out their own nooks and play spaces in open drains and five-foot ways.2 In the outer belt,3 they ventured outdoors spinning tops, throwing marbles, fighting fish and flying kites.4
Over time, the colony’s demographics evolved and its denizens made it clear that there was a need to better serve Singapore’s younger populace. This desire was partly influenced by the international playground movement that started in 19th century America5 which posited that dedicated playsites could serve as gathering points for neighbours and build cohesive communities in crowded cities.6
Members of the Singapore public began writing to the press suggesting playgrounds be built and open fields set aside for general well-being. Businesses and businessmen such as Huat Hin Oil Company, the Singapore Traction Company, the Siong Lim Sawmill Company, Aw Boon Haw and David J. Elias responded by financing the first few playgrounds in Singapore. Import and export merchant Elias, for instance, donated swings, a see-saw and a slide to Katong Park.
The colonial government officially swung into action in 1951. It set up a Playing Fields Committee which found that just 250 acres or so of space had been set aside for the sports and recreation needs of its 700,000 occupants. It thus recommended the addition of more recreational spaces. In 1953, the British-run Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) added play equipment to Queenstown, Singapore’s first satellite town. The playgrounds of 1950s and 1960s Singapore were basic and functional in nature, comprising simple slides, swings and see-saws.
Dragons, doves and pelicans — the iconic playgrounds of Singapore
When the Housing Development Board (HDB) took over from the SIT in 1960, it decided to design playgrounds that drew on local heritage and culture to help create stronger communal bonds.
The board’s playgrounds typically comprised simple, geometric or animal-shaped concrete structures in sand pits.8 Its first playground designer, trained architect Khor Ean Ghee, was largely responsible for this. He designed more than 30 playground prototypes which HDB architects could take their pick from. Many of these models also featured terrazzo tile work as well as swings fashioned out of tyre and rope.
The dragon playground is the most famous of these early HDB playgrounds. Children can totter up the dragon’s tail, walk along its long body and slide down its head.

Themed playgrounds of the 1980s
The next wave of playgrounds was designed by Chew Chek Peng. Her designs took on storytelling elements grounded in themes of identity and culture.
Take Tampines’ fruit-based playgrounds. There, larger-than-life watermelon slices and mangosteens take centre stage, paying homage to the estate’s fruit farm days.9 The colourful additions command attention, drawing children into a world where fruits are king.
No longer child’s play
The 1990s gave rise to a new playground building industry as private companies rose to take on the responsibility previously held by the HDB. They had to meet national safety standards rolled out in 1999 by Spring Singapore, which spelled out specifications such as allowable materials. Playgrounds thus began looking modular.
These days, playgrounds are incorporated with fitness corners to encourage multigenerational bonding. On average, one playground serves about 600 to 800 flats.10
There are about 10 playground builders today. Apart from HDB playgrounds, they also develop play areas for malls, entertainment venues and parks, some of which cost several million dollars to build.11 Singapore has indeed come a long way from the $2,000 playgrounds of the 1920s.

A raging inferno at Bukit Ho Swee swallowed the homes of 16,000 kampung dwellers and took four lives on 25 May 1961.1 It was one of the biggest fires to ever tear through Singapore – newspaper images depict plumes of black smoke blanketing the sky and obscuring the sun. In all, 40 hectares of densely-packed squatter land, the approximate size of 56 football fields, was scorched. The devastating fire cemented the necessity for safe, modern homes and marked a turning point in Singapore’s public housing programme.

A razed village
Kampong Bukit Ho Swee was an unplanned township of 20,000 residents living in haphazardly-erected huts made primarily of materials such as wood and zinc. It experienced a population surge after World War II.2
On 25 May 1961, a small fire started innocuously enough in a makeshift squatter hut lying on its fringe – a hillside at Kampong Tiong Bahru Road. However, powerful winds that day caused it to escalate into a roaring blaze, carving a sweeping path of destruction. Ferocious flames, furtherxf fuelled by oil and petrol from the area’s godowns, leapt rather easily across the road to Kampong Bukit Ho Swee.3 The blaze ended up engulfing the kampong’s warren of homes, searing through its flimsy roofs and walls.
Eyewitnesses’ accounts as well as news reports document kampung residents scrambling for their lives with key belongings in hand and children in tow.
The low water pressure of nearby hydrants and the haphazard lay of Kampong Bukit Ho Swee impeded firefighters’ valiant attempts to put out the blaze. (Image from the National Archives of Singapore
Since it was Hari Raya Haji, a public holiday, firefighters and police personnel had to be recalled from leave. They were pinged via repeated radio broadcasts. In all, 22 fire engines, 180 firemen, 20 police officers and nearly 1,000 army personnel were activated to battle the fire and help victims. Despite the strong show of force, luck was not on their side. Poorly pressured water hydrants, the kampung’s irregular, twisting alleys, and chaotic crowds clogging up entry points, made it near impossible to put out the fire.
The conflagration was only stopped in its tracks by an open space along Ganges Avenue. This prevented the fire from swallowing up flats across the road.5 The last of the flames were extinguished later that night at Delta Circus.
Rendering aid in the aftermath
With the fire put to bed, the authorities could now assess the damage. The blaze, they found, had taken with it shops, factories and a school in an area spanning approximately 40 hectares. According to official tallies, four lives were lost that day, 85 villagers were injured, and 16,000 people had lost their homes.6 The cause of the fire could not be determined.
To cater to the displaced, schools along Kim Seng Road were converted into temporary shelters. Government agencies, the military and volunteer organisations also banded together to offer much-needed support by providing essentials such as mattresses, water, gas, and electrical supplies.7

Meanwhile, at Kampong Bukit Ho Swee itself, 1,500 policemen had been deployed to patrol its charred grounds and protect occupants’ remnant belongings from looters.8 The authorities also worked to bury the carcasses of villagers’ perished livestock. Estimates placed villagers’ collective loss at approximately $2 million.9
Two days after the devastating incident, the Bukit Ho Swee Fire National Relief Fund Committee was set up by then Minister for Labour and Law K.M. Byrne. The committee eventually raised about $1.6 million to help victims get back on their feet.10
A safer way to live
Following emergency sessions with his cabinet as well as the Housing Development Board, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew assured victims a day after the blaze that they would be moved into new flats in areas such as Queenstown, Tiong Bahru, and even Bukit Ho Swee itself.11

Among other things, the government worked to acquire the affected Bukit Ho Swee site for low-cost housing. It also amended the Land Acquisition Ordinance to facilitate this.12 There were several phases to this operation and by 1970, Bukit Ho Swee had successfully transformed into a new residential area boasting 12,500 flats for more than 45,000 residents – the majority of whom were residents of the former kampung settlement.13
The incident paved the way for newly-independent Singapore to kickstart a nationwide drive to relocate its kampung-dwelling population to safer, modern high-rise homes.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/edmund-william-barker/story,"Pioneer leader and top sportsman, Edmund William Barker (1 December 1920-12 April 2001) was a strong advocate for sports. Among other things, he worked to ensure the National Stadium, an important stage for local athletes and a defining landmark for Singapore’s sports scene, was completed in time for the 1973 Southeast Asian Games.1
His other notable contributions include drafting the documents for Singapore’s separation from Malaysia in 1965, and serving as the principal actor in the last round of talks with the Malaysians. 2

An all-rounder
Barker was charismatic and athletic, serving as head prefect and football team captain at Raffles Institution. There, he befriended individuals such as Lee Kuan Yew.
At Raffles College, he represented the school in a broad range of sports such as badminton, cricket, soccer, rugby and hockey, playing with future leaders of Malaysia like Tun Abdul Razak along the way.4
Barker later won the highly sought-after Queen's Scholarship which he used to pursue law at Cambridge University. He graduated in 1951.
Raffles Institution was established in 1823. It was originally sited at Bras Basah Road, where Raffles City Shopping Centre stands today. (c.1920)
Career & accomplishments
In 1963, Lee invited Barker, who had been practising law,5 to enter politics. He agreed out of a feeling of attachment and loyalty to Singapore.6 Barker won a seat in Tanglin during the general election the same year. He went on to serve unopposed in the constituency until his retirement from politics in 1988.7
Swearing-in of Minister for Law E. W. Barker at Istana Negara in the presence of Yang Di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore, Yusof Bin Ishak (c.1964. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Barker played an important role in Singapore’s separation from Malaysia in 1965. Tasked to draw up the legal documents, he spent 10 days on the drafts. He also travelled to Kuala Lumpur with Minister of Finance Goh Keng Swee to finalise the deal with the Malaysians.8
Records credit Barker for his friendships with Deputy Prime Minister Tun Razak and Attorney-General Kadir Yusof as having helped mitigate some of the friction.9
Although Barker was the first on the Singapore side to sign the agreement just some time after midnight on 7 August 1965, he left space for his senior colleagues to add their names to the top of the treaty.10

While he never held a sports-related position in cabinet — having handled portfolios in Law, Home Affairs, National Development, Science and Technology, and Environment —11 Barker’s contributions to Singapore sports were significant nonetheless. For instance, he persuaded the government to allocate land and money12 for the construction of the National Stadium,13 and as President of the Singapore National Olympic Council from 1970 to 1990, was part of the main organising committee which secured Singapore’s role as host for two editions of the Southeast Asian Games.

Over the course of his 25-year career in politics, Barker was responsible for putting an end to the jury system; spearheading the Preservation of Monuments Act; and kickstarting the Golden Mile endeavour where a stretch running from Beach Road to Kallang was developed for city living.
Accolades Aplenty
For his contributions, Barker was noticed by global bodies such as the International Olympic Committee, which awarded him the Olympic Order (Silver) in 1985 for advancing Olympic values.14
In 1990, he was honoured by the Singapore government with the Order of Nila Utama (First Class).
Numerous sports-related scholarships and programmes at institutions such as Nanyang Technological University have been named after him. In 2011, his alma mater, Raffles Institution, set up the E. W. Barker Institute of Sports to support career athletes.15
E.W. Barker was very much instrumental in the construction of the National Stadium that would go on to not only host key sporting events like the 7th Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games in September 1973, but also the site of many memorable National Day Parades. (c. 1970s-1980s)

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/into-the-west-jurong-heritage-trail/story,"Text by Stefanie Tham
MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
A friendly debate comparing the western side of Singapore with the east went viral among netizens in early 2015, after a local Tumblr page was set up to poke fun at the west, which includes Jurong, Boon Lay, Pioneer, and Tuas. Commonly posted woes lamented the long time it takes to travel to and from the west, its lack of attractive amenities, and the dimal number of good food places found there.
Indeed, mention Jurong to most Singaporeans and most stereotypical descriptions tend to emerge, perhaps unjustly so. The west is often characterised by its industrial landscape, and thought to be barren, boring, and even bizarre. After all, those who do not live in Boon Lay may not regard smelling burnt cocoa at the MRT station as an ordinary, everyday experience.
However, Jurong is not as desolate as most people believe it to be. Empty grass fields in Jurong East have now given way to new shopping malls and beautiful landscaping, injecting life into the formerly quiet town. More changes can be expected as plans to develop the Jurong Lake District will commence in the years after 2015. Jurong is on the cusp of another stage of its transformation, perhaps one that will dispel old stereotypes.
A study of Jurong’s past also reveals an intriguing and layered history, of a time when Jurong was home to a number of prawn ponds and well-known for its brickworks. Its successful transformation into a modern industrial estate also tells a tale of unwavering determination and foresight during the period when our nation was only just learning how to stand independently.
The Jurong Heritage Trail, which was launched in April 2015 by the National Heritage Board (NHB), highlights this rich heritage gathered through in-depth research and interviews with residents and workers who once called Jurong their home. The trail shares a colourful history that challenges the notion that the west is without character or heritage. Some sites of heritage still exist today and this article presents a number of locations featured in the trail that people can visit. No passport required.
Imagined Borders and Early Trades
The historical boundary of Jurong as seen on official maps does not quite correspond with the memories of its long-time residents. According to a 1911 map, Jurong was a small parcel of land sandwiched between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah, and was located where Bukit Batok is today. Today’s Jurong East would have been a district called Pandan, whereas Boon Lay was formally called Peng Kang.

However, residents like Ng Lee Kar remembered a different Jurong, one whose boundary stretched from the 7 1⁄2 Milestone at Bukit Timah Road to Tuas at the 18th Milestone. This was a large area that spanned the entire length of Jurong Road, once the only road leading to the southwest of Singapore. As many kampongs were only accessible through it, villagers identified their location by the road’s milestones, and hence associated Jurong with the road.
Then, Jurong Road was not like the arterial roads Singaporeans are familiar with today. Consisting of only two lanes, a major accident would have rendered the road completely inaccessible. Former resident Francis Mane summed up this scenario as being “really jialat” (Hokkien term that connotes a difficult situation). His words could certainly be used to describe the day when Nanyang University opened in 1956 near the 14 1⁄2 Milestone. Nanyang University, a national monument, is the first Chinese language university in Southeast Asia and was formed with the help of donations from the local Chinese community. A major traffic jam occurred along Jurong Road on the day of its opening, rendering the motorway impassable, and took the record for the biggest traffic jam Singapore experienced then.
Like many other parts of Singapore, Jurong was covered with plantations, mainly gambier and rubber. But it was the prawn ponds that still evoke fond memories among residents, some whom used to make a living from it. Jurong contained nearly half of the 1,000 acres of prawn ponds in Singapore in 1955. The area where Pandan Reservoir is today used to be covered with mangroves and was a prawn pond reserve. Chua Kim Shua remembered selling these prawns for 40 to 50 cents per kilogram at the market. “I was able to earn about a few hundred dollars a month just selling prawns,” he recalled. “We scooped up the prawns using a pail, and there were many of them then.”

Another notable trade in Jurong was its brickworks industry, a prelude to Jurong’s industrialisation. Jurong was well-known for its brickworks since the 1920s, and once produced as many as three million bricks a month to meet demand in the construction sector in the 1970s. Also, the soil found in Jurong proved to be highly suitable for pottery making; Jurong had an abundance of the sticky mud known as nian tu, which was essential in pottery. This resulted in a burgeoning industry of brick and pottery making.
Today, people can still travel along a remaining stretch of the old Jurong Road entering from Bukit Batok Road or Jurong West Avenue 2. Although the Pandan Reservoir is no longer a prawn reserve, a slice of mangroves at the mouth of Sungei Pandan can still be seen. The reservoir is now an arena for water sports. A legacy of Jurong’s former brickworks industry remains in the form of the Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln and the Guan Huat Dragon Kiln (today’s Jalan Bahar Clay Studio), both located at Lorong Tawas where visitors can also pick up some ornamental pottery.
The Industrial Story
Most Singaporeans would not find the story of Jurong Industrial Estate unfamiliar. Often weaved into the Singapore Story as an example of how the country adapted to remain economically resilient, Jurong’s industrialisation shaped the lives of many individuals who found work in its factories and a new home to live in.
The vast amount of land and its deep coastal harbour made Jurong the ideal location to become Singapore’s primary industrial centre. The first bulldozer entered Jurong in September 1961, and its landscape has been altered permanently since. In spite of the government’s high expectations, only around 24 factories were set up by 1963 — Singapore was far from solving her problems of growing unemployment and declining entrepot trade. It was only through supplying tax incentives, establishing good labour relations, and creating a sense of security for investors did factories finally sprout. By 1970, Jurong boasted 264 factories with 32,000 workers.
Formerly under the purview of the Economic Development Board (EDB), the management of Jurong Industrial Estate was handed over to a new statutory board, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), in 1968. A new headquarters was built for JTC: Jurong Town Hall. The five-storey building cuts an impressive presence, reflecting a Brutalist style of architecture that emphasises the imposing bulkiness of the concrete structure. The building’s design was from a winning entry of an architectural design competition by a local firm, Architects Team 3, and it was most recently gazetted a national monument for its significance as a symbol of Singapore’s economic progress.

The memories of those who worked in Jurong reveal the unique challenges of working in the estate in its early years. Distance was a big issue for those who did not live in Jurong, particularly because of limited public transport services in the area. Woo Lee Tuan remembered the difficulty of getting to work: “Back then, there [was] still no road leading to the estate, and we had to go via Pasir Panjang Road or Jalan Jurong Kechil.” This resulted in many workers sharing rides on pirate taxis, which Woo used to get to work. “The vehicles were actually meant for transporting vegetables and other produce. It was quite an uncomfortable ride.”
Others whose companies provided free transport regarded themselves lucky. As Haji Saleh bin Abdul Wahab recalled, “The company provided private buses from the 7th Milestone. [They] provided transport for you even if you lived very far away like in Geylang.” Food centres were also scarce. Lim Sak Lan, who worked in JTC in the late 1960s shared: “When we were at worksites, we made do with site canteens. There were places away from the sites, but they were shabby little coffee shops and restaurants.”
Despite such discomforts, many of them nevertheless took pride in their work and over time, formed close friendships with their colleagues. Karen Lee, who worked in a spinning mill, reminisced fondly: “When we worked the night shift we would go to the hawker centre to buy food we liked and bring it [back] to the factories for our working colleagues. When we stayed in the company hostel, we were very close... I can [still] remember these people now, even those who came from Malaysia.”
In the present day, Jurong Town Hall still stands along Jurong Town Hall Road. In 2000, JTC moved across the road into a larger building, and the Town Hall is now a space for start-up companies. You can also take a stroll in the Garden of Fame next to the building, which commemorates the visits of many dignitaries to Jurong’s Industrial Estate over the years.
Green Lungs
In the process of conceiving the industrial estate, urban planners wanted to ensure that green spaces were integrated to preserve the beauty of Jurong’s natural landscape. Jurong was meant to be a self-contained garden industrial estate, and thus 12 percent of the land was set aside for public parks, gardens, and open spaces.
The Jurong Lake area is one such green lung planned to separate the industrial from the residential. The lake was formed after the Jurong River was dammed in 1971, creating the 81-hectare freshwater reservoir. Three islands were shaped, housing the Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden, and the golf course of the Jurong Country Club. When it first opened, the Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden attracted immense attention, the former receiving half a million visitors within eight months of its opening in April 1975.

Jurong Hill is another point of attraction. Formerly called Bukit Peropok, the hill is the tallest peak in Jurong today. It was converted into a park in 1968, and a Lookout Tower was constructed at the top of the hill. Residents might remember dining at the Japanese teppanyaki restaurant when it opened in 1970, or spending a leisurely day with the family exploring the hill’s Garden of Fame. The tower offers visitors a sweeping view of the industrial estate, and was a stop point for many visiting heads of states.

Today, the Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden are open for public visits. Jurong Hill is also accessible, although the restaurant has since closed.

Horses for Courses explored the history and development of horses, from the wild early years to the highly selective breeding of the present day. This exhibition celebrated the partnership between man and horse, in both work and play, within numerous cultures around the world.
Picture of the exhibition hall
A range of philatelic materials highlights the horse’s role in agriculture, postal delivery, war, racing, and other areas. Horses have long been a reliable form of transportation and recreation for man. From myths and legends to art and hobby, Horses for Courses took visitors on a journey that revealed the strength, speed and loyalty of this noble creature.
Wall display at the exhibition
Way Back Then
The horse species Equus caballus, is from the Equidae family. It is a mammal that can be traced back some 50 million years.
The early ancestors were the size of small dogs and lived in Europe and North America. Over millions of years, the horse became taller with longer legs. It evolved to have one main toe (hoof); its neck lengthened with a light arch, and its teeth adapted to graze on grass, instead of chomping on leaves from plants.
During the Stone Age, horses were hunted for meat. In some parts of Europe, early depictions of horses were from cave paintings from this period. It’s believed that wild horses roamed the plains of Asia and Europe about 30,000 years ago. But as the world changed, and as man began to encroach on their land, the number of wild horses started to dwindle. The only remaining wild horses today are the endangered Przewalski’s horses, with only about 250 roaming wild in their native home in Mongolia.
Progress and Civilisation
About 4,500 years ago, man started to domesticate horses for transportation and to move heavy loads. Engravings, sculptures, and writings show that horses were used to draw chariots – especially for burials – in early civilisations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India.
The Egyptians were renowned for their skill in crafting swift chariots to carry archers for warfare, for example. The terracotta steeds buried alongside the soldiers in Xi’an, China, are also a testament to their importance in Chinese warfare.
The Umayyads, circa 650 AD, used well-trained Arabian horses for numerous successful raids and battles that created a vast empire stretching from the Middle East to France. And around the 13th century, Mongols led by Genghis Khan conquered a great expanse of land across continental Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe. The secret to the Mongols’ success, it is said, was in using three to four horses in their battles and travels. As soon as one horse tired, another would take its place. In this manner, the Mongols’ journeys and cavalry attacks were continuous.
Horses in the Americas disappeared with climatic changes but the Spaniards brought them back to North America during their conquests. Native Americans discovered the horses' usefulness and soon mastered the skill of horse riding for herding and warfare. Wild horses in North America are not considered truly wild; they are feral. A long time ago, these horses were domesticated by man but they were either returned to the wild, or escaped to wander free.
Riding into History
Ideas, language, culture, knowledge, and religion developed more efficiently in societies that harnessed horsepower. In Central Asia, for instance, horses enabled the transmission of discoveries such as paper, iron, printing and gunpowder across great distances.
In medieval times, armoured knights often formed the main thrust of attack but this eventually gave way to an artillery offensive. Seafaring European nations spread their influence and power across different continents - aided by horses for inland conquests.
Mail Delivery
Man relied on horsepower before the advent of motorised transportation. Letters and parcels were delivered by men on horses or in carriages. In the United States, the Pony Express (1860) was a relay system which spanned the distance from Missouri to California, over the Ro y Mountains. It took horseback riders about 10 days to cover a distance of over 3,000 km.
Stamps featuring mail delivery by horse
Accessories
Saddle
In early times, man rode on horses bareback, or with a piece of cloth or blanket. From around the 3rd century BC, leather saddles were introduced. With the use of stirrups, riders - especially warriors - were better able to keep their balance on a horse.
There are two main types of modern saddles. The Western has a high pommel in the front, which is useful for hanging a lariat – a rope in the form of a lasso. At the back is a large cantle for better seat support. These features provide the rider with more comfort, especially when herding cattle. The English saddle is less padded and generally lighter.
Horseshoes
Horseshoes are usually U-shaped and they are nailed to the horse’s hooves to protect them from the hard ground. Most horses are checked by a farrier or horse shoe fitter every six to eight weeks to tidy the hooves.
History & Culture
Horses often connote honour, intelligence, bravery, and many artists have depicted these qualities in art. Here are some philatelic examples showing man and horse through history, art and culture.
Austria: Lipizzaner
Stamp of Lipizzaner
The Lipizzan is closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna in Austria. The horses are trained in the school to perform the elegant movements and jumps of classical dressage, including what is also known as “haute ecole”, or “high school” jumps. The ‘dancing’ Lipizzaner, a Spanish-Andalusian breed, can be traced back to the 7th century when Barb horses were brought into Spain by the Moors and crossed with native Spanish horses.
China: Qi Jiguang
Stamp of Qi Jiguang
Qi Jiguang was a Chinese military general and national hero during the Ming Dynasty of the 16th century. He was noted for his courage and leadership in the fight again Japanese pirates along the east coast of China, as well as his work on the Great Wall of China. Here, he is depicted riding his horse ready for battle.
China: Chinese Opera
Stamp of Chinese Opera
The use of symbolic representation is a primary feature in Chinese opera. In this picture, for example, the use of a fringed cane is to signify riding a horse.
Hungary: Arrival of the Hungarians
Stamp of Arrival of the Hungarians
The painting by Árpád Feszty and other artists depicts the Arrival of the Hungarians (on horses) to the Carpathian Basin in 895. It was completed in 1894 to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the event. This cyclorama – a panoramic painting framed in a cylindrical platform - measures 115 metres by 15 metres and is housed in the National Historical Memorial Park in Ópusztaszer, Hungary.
Jersey: The Black Horse of St. Ouen
Stamp of The Black Horse of St. Ouen
Long ago, Jersey was ruled by the French – much to the unhappiness of the islanders. One such person was Philippe de Carteret, the Seigneur of St. Ouen and a member of the island’s most influential family. To prevent any problems, the French soldiers decided to kidnap him. Philippe tried to escape on his black horse, and raced toward his manor across a deep wide ditch. His horse jumped and cleared it and returned Philippe to his home safely. But his faithful horse soon collapsed and died. To honour his horse, Philippe had the animal buried in his garden.
Kyrgyzstan: “Kyz Koomay”
Stamp of Kyz Koomay
The stamp depicts a popular game in Kyrgyzstan, where a young man has to try and overtake a young woman – while both of them are on horseback. The woman usually rides a faster horse and starts about ten seconds ahead of the man. If he catches her, he is rewarded with a kiss. If he does not, the woman can then whip him.
Mongolia: Morin Khuur
Stamp of Morin Khuur
The Morin Khuur is a horse head-shaped fiddle. It has two rings and is played with a bow usually rung with horsehair. Traditional folk songs are often accompanied by the wistful resonance of the instrument, which is said to mimic a horse’s neigh or the wind whistling across the Mongolian plains.
Kyrgyzstan: “Kok-Boru” (Blue Wolf)
Stamp of ""Kok-Boru""
Mongolia: The Secret History of Mongols
Stamp of The Secret History of the Mongols
It is generally agreed that the Uyghur-scripted literature, “The Secret History of the Mongols”, was produced around the 13th century after Genghis Khan’s death. Even though it is a compilation of folklore and myth, the 12 chapters serve as a significant reference to the history, culture, and genealogy of the Mongol Empire.
The people of Mongolia are fond of horse racing, wrestling and archery, often known as the “three games of men”. Horses feature prominently in their lives. Horses and riders were decorated in colourful silks and ribbons during the races, which cover distances from 15 to 30 km.
Poland: Knight Tournament

The first modern knight tournament was held in Poland in 1977. Participants dressed as knights arrived from all over Europe to compete in medieval games, as depicted in these stamps.
Singapore: Kuda Kepang
Stamp of Kuda Kepang
Kuda Kepang or Kuda Lumping is a type of dance that originated from Java, in which the dancer dons a colourful horse costume. The dance is said to be a re-enactment of battles again the Dutch, but these days it is performed more for entertainment or celebrations. Another version of this dance induces a trance on the dancer, who then mimics the behaviour of horses.
Portugal: Lusitano Horses
Stamp of Lusitano Horses
The Lusitano, named in 1966 after Portugal’s ancient Roman name, is closely related to the Spanish-Andalusian horse. Lusitanos have competed in the Olympics and World Equestrian Games. In early times, they were deployed for war but these days they only participate in bloodless bullfighting.
Ukraine: Straw horse
Stamp of Straw Horse
Located in a region blessed with rich ‘black soil’, Ukraine has abundant wheat. After the grain is removed, the raw is used to feed animals, for housing, and to make traditional handicrafts.
United Kingdom: All the Queen’s Horses
Stamp of All the Queen's Horses
To mark the British Horse Society’s 50th anniversary, four stamps were issued that featured Queen Elizabeth II’s ceremonial horses: two carriage horses from the Royal Mews, and two from the Household Cavalry.
United States: Cherokee Strip Land Run
Stamp of Cherokee Strip Land Run
The Cherokee Strip was an 8 million-acre piece of land in Northwest Oklahoma. In the late 1830s, the government moved the Cherokee tribe to eastern Oklahoma, and the natives were given a passage, known as the Cherokee Strip, to the western hunting ground.
In the early 1880s, many cattle ranches were established in the area. It was during this period that the term “cowboy” was coined and that the expansion of the American West began. In 1893, by presidential order, the Cherokee Strip was opened for settlement. This resulted in the great land race, where more than 100,000 people rushed to lay claim on land.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
The museum scene in Singapore has flourished over the past few years and has reached a peak of over 50 museums in 2015, with a slew of diverse galleries and cultural institutions opening. As a physical space connecting the public with the arts, heritage, and culture, the museum remains a relevant and necessary institution in the cultural eco-system.
Façade of the Indian Heritage Centre at 5 Campbell Lane.
Launched on May 7, 2015 and located in the heart of Little India, the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) showcases not only artefacts from the National Collection but also the community’s collections. It also actively collaborates with the community for programming and outreach. Two hundred and three out of 443 artefacts on display at the museum are donated by or on loan from the community. These pieces in the permanent galleries offer a visual and chronological representation of the community’s history, marking periods since the pre-modern era when South Asians established contact with Southeast Asians and East Asians.
The galleries focus on five major themes, starting from the early interactions between South and Southeast Asia, leading the visitor through the origins and migration of the South Asian community in Singapore, the pioneers and social and political awakening of the community in Singapore and Malaya and its pioneers, ending with contributions of Indians towards the making of Singapore as a nation.
The artefacts donated express this narrative in a variety of ways. One of the star artefacts highlighting the Indian migrants’ rites of passage, attire, language, religious affiliations and festivals is the twentieth-century gold necklace (Kasumalai) which is a gift from the estate of Santhanam Victor Louis and the family of Gnanapragasam Pillai.
Gold Necklace or Kasumalai, 20th century. Gold. Gift from the estate of Santhanam Victor Louis and the family of Gnanapragasm Pillai.
The traditional necklace, made of gold and adorned with precious stones, was donated for alamkara, or ornamentation of deities, to the Sri Thandayuthapani temple built by the Chettiar community in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City. The Nattukottai Nagarattar Chettiars, who were among the early Indian migrants to the Southeast Asian region with business establishments in Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia and Singapore, commonly built temples in their places of settlement for the Hindu deity Murugan.
Another interesting artefact, on loan from P. G. P. Ramakrishnan, is the silver spade presented to P. Govindasamy Pillai by Holy Tree Balasubramaniar Temple, Naval Base, Sembawang on January 24, 1970. This artefact helps to present the visitors with further insight into the early Indians in Singapore and Malaya who lived during the pre-World War II era.

One of these pioneers were P. Govindasamy Pillai, a native of Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu. Popularly known as PGP, he left home in his teens and boarded a ship to Singapore. After landing at Tanjong Pagar in 1905, he worked at a store which he later bought over, allowing him to establish a string of PGP stores along Serangoon Road. An ace money manager, he gradually saved enough to expand into other businesses including textile shops and flour and spice mills. He was also a noted philanthropist, a prominent donor to the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple, a founder-member of the Indian Chamber of Commerce that was set up in 1937, and a Justice of the Peace from 1939.
The impact of nationalist and sub-ethnic nationalist movements on the Indian community in the region is shown through reformist activities and the revitalisation of the Tamil Language and identity by community leaders such as Thamizhavel G. Sarangapany. This is showcased by the selection of archival photographs, documents, and personal artefacts from the collection of Sarangapany’s immediate family, donated by his daughter, Rajam Sarangapany.
Sarangapany, who arrived in Singapore in 1924, was an active writer and publisher. He set up the Tamil magazine Munnetram in 1929 and the Tamil Murasu newspaper in 1935. Through his writings, he promoted the principles of the Tamil reform movement. He encouraged Tamils to make Singapore their home, helped them gain citizenship, and championed for the Tamil language to be recognised as one of the national languages in Singapore.
Women also played a part as leading pioneers of the South Asian community in Singapore. This is characterised by a signature artefact gifted by Jamshed K. Fozdar and Parvati Fozdar: a commemorative plaque presented by the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) to Shirin Fozdar in 1988 in recognition of her contributions to Singapore as a staunch advocate of women’s rights. Fozdar, who is of Indian origin, arrived in Singapore with her husband in 1950. By 1953, she had become instrumental in setting up Singapore’s first girls’ club at the Joo Chiat Welfare Centre to teach women English and arithmetic. She was elected honorary secretary of SCW in April 1952, and thereafter served a key role in the drafting and establishment of the Women’s Charter in 1961. She also played an important part in the formation of the Muslim Syariah court in 1958. Her role in Singapore’s women’s movement represented a pioneering effort in establishing Southeast Asia’s Baha’i community.

The diverse array of individuals, communities, religious and cultural organisations which comprised the South Asian community are represented by the textured narrative of the permanent galleries showcasing a primarily community collection. The IHC is evidence that the role of a heritage institution has evolved into a relevant social space of connectivity, culture, and heritage, supported by the people for the people.
According to IHC Director, Dr Gauri Krishnan, “IHC has been very fortunate in its artefact collection drive and has managed to source a significant number of artefacts through the community as well as the national collection within a very short span of time. Its collections are representative, cover diverse periods in history and communities and range from classical to modern — appealing to a wide cross-section of visitors. Even the evocative displays and media devices have made the artefacts more accessible and appealing.” IHC has harnessed media and technology to tell stories, making collections more accessible and providing the community’s voice to the thematic curation. Other than three large interactives and over 20 touch screen interactives, IHC also offers visitors an immersive and novel experience with an Augmented Reality enabled audio guide. Commencing with an introductory film, which offers a curated perspective on the five themes in the permanent galleries, the interactive experience is geared towards engaging both group and individual visitors.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/macdonald-house-bombing/story,"TL;DR
As one of the taller buildings in Singapore at the time, the red-bricked MacDonald House at 40A Orchard Road became the target of terrorists.1 at the height of Konfrontasi (confrontation).2 On 10 March 1965, two rogue Indonesian marines detonated an 11kg bomb at the building, killing three and injuring 33.3 It was one of 37 attacks.4 which unraveled during a period where Indonesia, led by President Sukarno, strongly opposed the formation of Malaysia.5
A post-war icon and a symbol of confidence in the future
Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, Singapore worked to rebuild and rise from the ashes. Completed in 1949, MacDonald House was a building which exemplified the nation’s hope and confidence in the future.
Besides the northeast, the Japanese also swiftly repaired the bombed causeway to allow more troops to enter Singapore. (Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Standing at 10-storeys, it was one of the tallest buildings in Singapore at the time. It was also the first office building to be fully air-conditioned. It attracted prominent international banks as tenants.
The structure was designed by Reginald Eyre of Palmer and Turner, and named after Malcolm MacDonald, a well-loved British commissioner general for Southeast Asia from 1948 to 1955.
No ordinary Wednesday
10 March 1965 started as a run-off-the-mill work day for the 150 Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) employees based at MacDonald House. Like any other afternoon, staff had shut down the business at 3pm and were in the process of closing accounts.
Interior damage of the MacDonald House as a result of the use of nitroglycerin explosives.
Unfortunately, just seven minutes later, a deafening explosion ripped through the building. The inner walls of the mezzanine floor absorbed the blast’s force as did the building’s pillars. Windows within a 90m radius of the explosion shattered and cars parked outside the building also suffered damage. Dazed bank staff and passersby scrambled to safety. Several were not so lucky. Three people – filing clerk Juliet Goh, 23; private secretary Suzie Choo, 36; and driver Yasin Kesit, 43 – who had been sitting outside the building died that day. Another 33 were injured.
Survivors such as Reverend Kenny Yeo, who was 23 at the time of the incident, have been vocal in speaking out against acts of terror. Sharing about the horror he experienced, Yeo said he had been walking by when the bomb exploded. He recalled: “My eyeball was blown out of its socket, and I had approximately 366 stitches.”
An explosive confrontation
Investigations led rather quickly to the arrests of Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said – Indonesian marine commandos in their 20s. Dressed as civilians, they had left nitroglycerin explosives near the lift lobby of the building’s mezzanine floor.
The act of terrorism was roundly condemned by then Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye as a “senseless act of cruelty”. The marines were subsequently hanged on 17 October 1968.
The MacDonald House bombing wasn’t the only attack launched on Singapore. Between 1963 and 1966, more startling attacks protesting Singapore’s merger with Malaya were sprung on the island.

No longer the victim
Today, following some rounds of renovation, there is little evidence of the tragedy that struck MacDonald House. It is occupied by tenants such as global advertising conglomerate McCann Worldgroup and beauty and wellness empire Expressions International, among other enterprises.
In 2003, MacDonald House was gazetted as a national monument. In 2015, five decades to the day of the bombing, a memorial was unveiled at Dhoby Ghaut Green which pays tribute to the victims of the tragedy and honours veteran soldiers and volunteers who defended Singapore during the tumultuous Konfrontasi era.
Today the MacDonald House remains as the last remaining brick structure in the Orchard Road area. It was gazetted as a National Monument in 2003 and is now home to its main tenants CitiBank and McCann Worldgroup.(c.2013. Image from lionraw.com)

Notes"
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/shirin-fozdar/story,"Shirin Fozdar (b. 1905, Bombay, India – d. 2 February 1992, Singapore) is a pioneer women’s rights activist. She championed social issues for women in Singapore and was a key figure in the implementation of several laws and policies that benefited women in Singapore. Together with her husband, they were among the first to introduce the Baha’i Faith in Singapore.
Early Years
Shirin was born in India in 1905 to Persian parents of the Baha’i Faith. Even at a young age, she was an outspoken advocate, often speaking out on women’s rights and social issues as a student in Bombay. At 16, Shirin was invited to speak on the topic of university education at the Town Hall of Karachi. The monumental event was hailed as “the first time an Eastern woman had addressed a public gathering in the East”. She also spoke at the League of Nations in Geneva on the Equality of Nationality for Women. In 1950, Shirin left India for Singapore with her husband K M Fozdar.

Career & Accomplishments
The Fozdars settled down in Singapore in 1950 and were among the first to introduce the Baha’i Faith in Singapore. By 1952, there were enough Baha’is in Singapore to form the first Local Spiritual Assembly. Today, the Baha’i Faith is one of the ten major religions represented in the Inter-Religious Organisation of Singapore.

Shirin noted the lack of legal protection for women, particularly in the areas of marriage and dissolution. Polygamy was rampant and an accepted custom. These prompted Shirin to take up the women’s cause and wage war against polygamy in Singapore. In 1951, she gathered with a group of women activists to discuss the formation of an umbrella organisation to provide a unifying voice for the various women’s organisations already existing in Singapore. Following this meeting, the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) was formed in April 1952.
Shirin played a key role in the establishment of the Syariah Court in 1958. She corresponded with then Chief Minister David Marshall on the subject of easy divorces for Muslim marriages, which left many women stranded in dire straits. The Syariah Court was established in 1958 and the divorce procedures put in place led to a sharp decline in the divorce rate within the Muslim community.
As the honorary secretary of the SCW, Shirin also actively wrote to government officials, community leaders and the press to lobby for monogamous marriage law. Her persistence paid off when the People’s Action Party (PAP) included women’s rights in their election manifesto in 1959. After the PAP won the election, they passed the Women’s Charter in the Legislative Assembly in 1961. The Women’s Charter effectively outlawed polygamy for non-Muslims and provided fundamental rights for women.
Following Singapore’s attainment of self-government in 1959, a Legislative Assembly Election was held in May. The People’s Action Party, led by Lee Kuan Yew, won by a landslide to form the new government. The party had included women’s rights in their manifesto in 1959. (Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Shirin focused on regional work after the passing of her husband. She spoke at international conferences on women’s rights and set up schools in regions like Thailand to provide education for women.
Later Years
Shirin received an award from the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations in 1988 on International Women’s Day for her invaluable contribution to the women’s movement. She passed away on 2 February 1992. She was inducted to the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame in 2014 for her contributions and efforts as Singapore’s pioneer women’s rights activist. She is also featured in the Indian Heritage Centre.

Singapore’s first elected chief minister was none other than formidable criminal lawyer David Saul Marshall (12 March 1908 – 12 December 1995) – the founder of the Workers’ Party. The eloquent, bushy-browed politician, who was often photographed with a pipe in hand, championed for independence from colonial rule1 and also laid the foundations for political initiatives such as meet-the-people sessions.2
A poster titled ‘Speakers and Members of the First Legislative Assembly, Singapore’. David Marshall can be seen on top row, third from left. (c.1955)
From textiles to law
Born in Singapore to Saul Nassim Mashal,4 David Marshall, whose name was anglicised in 1920,5 was raised in a Jewish orthodox family alongside six younger siblings. School life for him started at a kindergarten run by the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus.6
As a student at Raffles Institution, Marshall became friends with individuals such as Benjamin Sheares and George Oehlers – fellow future leaders of Singapore.
During the course of his education, Marshall attempted to apply for the highly sought-after Queen’s Scholarship. However, being of weak constitution, he collapsed before he could take the exam. Marshall thus pivoted to the field of textile manufacturing which he pursued in Belgium.
Back home in Singapore, he worked as a textile representative and a French language teacher.7 Before he turned 30, Marshall decided to read law.8
A patriot at heart
When World War II came around, Marshall’s family fled Singapore. He, however, chose to stay behind, going so far as to join the Singapore Volunteers Corps “B” Company to defend the island. Unfortunately, he was captured in February 1942 and detained as a Prisoner-of-War (POW) for three years and six months.9
Even under the oppressive rule of his Japanese wardens, Marshall’s outspoken personality and energy shone bright. A champion of justice, he frequently spoke up for the rights of his fellow prisoners. This drew the ire of his captors who tried to limit his influence.10 Over the course of his internment, Marshall was moved to multiple POW camps and even to a forced labour site in Hokkaido, Japan.11
Founded by Father Jean-Marie Beurel in 1854, the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) - otherwise known as Town Convent - was a Catholic girls' school that also took in boys, including Singapore’s first Chief Minister David Marshall, for a period of time from the 1900s till the Japanese Occupation. (Early-mid 20th century)
This Prisoner-of-War (POW) camp in Innoshima, Hiroshima was probably one of the 26 POW camps that David Marshall was sent to during the Japanese occupation. (c.1940s)
Foray into politics
After the war, Marshall completed his law degree and worked at a number of law firms such as Aitken and Ong Siang, and Allen and Gledhill in Singapore.
In 1949, he joined the Singapore Progressive Party for about three years.12 Later, in March 1955, guided by his desire to boost the standing of the people of Singapore,13 Marshall decided to put his legal career on hold to focus more on politics. Among other things, he was determined to banish “racial superiority” and “break through sonic barriers against Asians and especially Jews”.14
The same year, the Labour Front party led by Marshall was victorious in the Legislative Assembly election.15 It had secured 10 of the 17 seats it contested, and formed a coalition government with the Alliance Party. Marshall himself won a seat in Cairnhill and became Singapore’s first elected chief minister.16 
The Labour Front contested in the 1955 Legislative Assembly Election and secured the most votes. As it did not win by a majority, it formed a coalition government with the Singapore Alliance Party and Marshall became Singapore’s first Chief Minister (c.1957)
A brief tenure
As chief minister, Marshall tried to pursue self-governance and independence from the British. However, before he had the chance to warm his seat, the communists began giving him trouble. Civil unrest in the form of the Hock Lee Bus Riots,17 as well as the other unpredictable antics of Singapore’s growing left-wing movement, kept him busy.
Although he was unsuccessful in attaining self-governance for Singapore, Marshall left a lasting legacy. While at the helm, a white paper on education policy was put forth advocating for more focus on the English language as well as multilingualism – fundamental features of Singapore's education system today.18
Invested in fighting for workers’ rights, Marshall was also instrumental in passing the Labour Ordinance to put an end to long work shifts. Additionally, he was involved in the introduction of schemes to help locals secure employment in the British-dominated civil service.19
Following unsuccessful talks with the British about self-governance for Singapore,20 Marshall resigned on 7 June 1956 after a brief 14-month tenure.
His political contributions, however, did not stop there. A year later, he founded the Workers’ Party. Thereafter, he contested the Anson by-election, and on 15 July 1961 won a seat in parliament. In 1963, Marshall left the party21 and resumed his law career.22
Marshall was outspoken about his beliefs, and was against capital punishment as well as the abolition of the trial by jury system. His drive and passion led him to score acquittal after acquittal over the span of 41 years.
Upon the invitation of then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam, Marshall went on to serve as Singapore’s first foreign ambassador to France, Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland from 1978 to 1993.23

Legacy in criminal law
Stricken with lung cancer, Marshall passed away at the age of 87 on 12 December 1995. Numerous scholarships and fellowships, such as the David Marshall Professorship in Law and the Singapore Management University’s David Marshall Prize, were established in honour of his exemplary legal career.24

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/benjamin-sheares/story,"TL;DR
Before taking office as Singapore’s second president, Benjamin Sheares (12 August 1907–12 May 1981) spent three decades tirelessly improving Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) standards in Singapore, having been dismayed by high maternal mortality rates in the 1930s.
Overcoming colonial biases, he rose through the ranks of the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, fought for its post-war conversion into an O&G hospital, and was the first medical practitioner in Singapore to use the lower segment method for Caesarean sections.1 This and more helped shave the maternal mortality rate from 70 to 80 deaths per 10,000 deliveries in the 1930s to less than 10 by 1955.
Father of obstetrics and gynaecology
Benjamin Sheares aspired to be a doctor from a young age. As a child, his favourite game was playing doctor with his sister Alice.
There were few opportunities for Asians to become doctors in the British-run colony but Sheares worked to overcome these hurdles, including for instance, winning a scholarship to study medicine. By 1942, he had become head of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) department and medical superintendent of the local patient’s section at Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH), overcoming the prejudices of his colonial superiors through hard work and genius.
Deeply concerned about high maternal mortality rates, Sheares was the first in Singapore to use the lower segment method of performing Caesarean sections. With this, as well as improvements in antenatal and postnatal outpatient care under his watch, maternal mortality rates fell to less than 10 deaths per 10,000 deliveries in 1955 compared to seven to eight times that in the 1930s.
It was also through Sheares that KKH was converted into an O&G Hospital after World War II.
The good doctor was reputed among his peers and patients for his golden fingers and superior surgical skills which led to minimal scarring. He was well-liked for his kind bedside manner and strong dedication to patient welfare. He checked in on patients regularly, even during the holidays, and was known for giving free treatment to the poor.
In 1950, he was appointed professor of O&G at the University of Malaya in Singapore.
Despite his busy schedule, Sheares authored papers on O&G and other topics such as infertility, cancer and surgical techniques. In all, 29 of his papers were published over the span of 24 years. Sheares also earned international acclaim for developing a technique to create an artificial vagina for individuals born without one. It eventually came to be known as the ""Sheares Procedure"".
In 1961, as his health began to trouble him, Sheares started his own private practice in Raffles Place.
Benjamin Sheares was one of several distinguished alumni who graduated from the King Edward VII College of Medicine. He was appointed acting professor of the college in 1945. (c.1950s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)

Family Man
Sheares married Yeo Seh Geok, a trained midwife in 1939. The couple had three children together.

While he spent long hours at work, he made up for it in the evenings when he would sometimes return with ice-cream for the family. On Sundays, Sheares brought his family out for a movie and a meal.
Singapore’s second president
At the age of 63, just two years after opening his own clinic, Sheares was approached by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to become Singapore’s second president. A generally private person, he took some time to consider this offer. His eventual acceptance of the post stemmed from his sense of duty to the nation.
Elected by parliament in December 1970, Sheares carried out the role with quiet dignity, continuing to live in his own home in Holt Road instead of the Istana. Because politics was out of his wheelhouse, he read extensively to keep abreast of current affairs, international politics and diplomacy.
During his decade as president, Sheares remained active in the medical field.

Ill-health plagued Sheared sporadically during his terms in office. In November 1980, a tumour was found in his lungs, and on 3 February 1981, he appeared unwell when he opened Parliament. Before he fell into a coma on 3 May 1981, Sheares had his affairs sorted. He died on 12 May 1981 with deep regret that he had been unable to see through his third term as president.

His wake at the Istana was thronged by 85,000 people — among them former patients touched by his dedication including a woman whose life and baby he had saved after an emergency operation at night.
A month later, Prime Minister Lee paid tribute to Sheares in a moving special address.2 Lee fondly recalled their regular monthly sessions where they would discuss work. Sheares, he said, had shared his cares of office.
These visits were ramped up towards the end with Lee visiting him once a week to comfort and console him. Lee said: ""During those harrowing weeks, at no time did I see fear or panic in his eyes or expression.""
With emotion in his voice, Lee added: “He will always live in my memory. though when he died, a part of me also died. When a friend dies, the shared conversations, the shared experiences, the bonds of friendship can no longer be renewed. It is as if a thread has snapped. The thread is still there, but the person holding the other end has loosened his hold. The thread is slack.""

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/goh-keng-swee/story,"TL;DR
Dr Goh Keng Swee (6 October 1918–14 May 2010),1 one of the founding members of the People’s Action Party (PAP),2 orchestrated much of modern Singapore’s economic success. Among other notable accomplishments, Goh famously rescued the island from the brink of bankruptcy and was instrumental in shaping its industrialisation programme.3
Apart from serving the nation as its first Minister of Finance (1959-1965), Goh also took on the roles of Deputy Prime Minister (1973-1984), Minister of Defence (1965-1967; 1970-1979), and Minister of Education (1979-1980; 1981-1984). In addition, Goh chaired a number of government-led companies as well as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) from 1980 to 1985.4
A heart for the people
Goh was born in Malacca, Malaysia. He moved to Singapore with his family in 1920 at the age of two.5 He went on to study at Anglo-Chinese School and subsequently graduated from Raffles College in 1939. Armed with a diploma in the arts, Goh found a job as a civil servant in the British Administration.6 His work was disrupted by the invasion of the Japanese army and its subsequent three-year occupation.
After the war, Goh re-entered the civil service, working at the Social Welfare Department (SWD)7 as a social researcher.8 It was here that his passion for social justice and welfare was kindled. Goh also played a key role in putting together causes such as the People’s Kitchens9 to alleviate post-war poverty among locals.10 His overall performance at work caught the eye of his superiors who gave him a scholarship to study statistics at the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1948.11
Fighting injustice
In London, Goh started an anti-colonial group called the Malayan Forum.12 He was its first chairman.13 There, he met individuals such as Lee Kuan Yew and Toh Chin Chye who became his lifelong comrades. They gathered regularly to discuss the future of Malaya and Singapore.14 At LSE, Goh was awarded first-class honours in economics in 1951, and went on to obtain a doctor of philosophy degree.
Upon his return to Singapore, Goh was given the post of an assistant director at SWD. Shortly after, he became director. It was around this period that he felt perturbed by the pay disparity between non-British and British civil servants. Together with fellow civil servant and future PAP comrade K.M. Byrne, Goh formed the Council for Joint Action in 1952 to fight for equal pay.
Goh subsequently left the civil service to join politics full-time, contesting in the 1959 general elections as a member of the PAP – the year Singapore secured self-governance. Goh won a seat at Kreta Ayer and became Singapore's first finance minister after the PAP’s historic sweep at the polls.15

Turning a faltering economy around
Goh, as Singapore’s newly-minted finance minister, inherited a government on the verge of financial collapse16 – the nation was projected to suffer a deficit of $14 million by the end of 1959.17 Through expenditure cuts and other initiatives, Goh not only managed to save the country from going into the red but also succeeded in bringing in a tidy surplus of $1 million by the end of the year. His judicious style of fiscal prudence went on to have a lasting impact on the PAP government’s approach towards the country’s finances.
In 1961, Goh established the Economic Development Board (EDB).18 Along the way, he also launched an ambitious project in Jurong to transform swampland into an industrial estate.19 The unstable situation in Singapore at the time however, left many ill-convinced of its feasibility. Some even gave his Jurong Industrial Estate project the disheartening nickname “Goh’s Folly”.20
Goh nonetheless preserved. Citing the initiative as “an act of faith in the people of Singapore”,21 he put tremendous energy into the project and succeeded in proving critics wrong. By 1968, Jurong was home to 300 factories with 21,000 workers under their employ.22 Goh’s strategy for success included having EDB conduct factory opening ceremonies daily over a three month period to drum up hype and awareness that the estate was now “open for business”.23
Along the way, Goh also established the Development Bank of Singapore (1968)24 and MAS (1971)25 to bolster Singapore’s economic status in the region.

Establishing the Singapore Armed Forces
When Singapore became independent in 1965, Goh was appointed Minister of Defence and was tasked to build up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch.26 To achieve this, Goh introduced the 1967 NS (Amendment) Bill which essentially made conscription compulsory for Singaporean males27, thus greatly accelerating the formation of the SAF.28

In 1965, Goh was appointed the Minister of Defence and was handed the daunting task of building up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch.

(c.1985. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Other contributions
As the Education Minister, Goh was asked to identify and address issues with Singapore’s education system. His findings and suggestions were put together in a report which subsequently led to major reforms and an overhaul.29 Among the changes – the introduction of a streaming system so primary and secondary school students could learn at their own pace.30 This, he felt, could help address the issue of high dropout rates.31
While at the helm at MAS, Goh focused on promoting Singapore as an international financial centre. He made major amendments to the Banking Act, the MAS Act and the Finance Companies Act.32
Goh’s contributions went beyond policymaking. Among other things, he pushed for the establishment of Sentosa (1968), the Jurong Bird Park (1971), the Singapore Zoological Gardens (1973) and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (1986).33
Built in 1971 and 1973 respectively, the idea of the beloved Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoological Gardens were also initiatives spearheaded by Dr Goh Keng Swee. (c.1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
The idea behind turning the former military base on Pulau Blakang Mati into the tourist and leisure destination we know today as Sentosa was conceived by Dr Goh Keng Swee back in 1968. (c. Mid 1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
A lasting legacy
Goh stepped down from politics in 1984. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the nation, he was awarded the prestigious Order of Temasek (First Class) the following year.
Numerous scholarships and foundations were also set up in his name. Among them, the Goh Keng Swee Professorship and the Master’s Scholarship in Economics. In 2008, Goh’s wife Phua Swee Liang set up the Goh Keng Swee Foundation to help the disadvantaged.34
Goh passed away on 14 May 2010 but the fruits of his labour are still evident today.35

Introduction
Lee Kuan Yew was the founding father of modern Singapore. The Japanese occupation had shaped his political thinking and led to his involvement in the anti-colonial struggle. Soon after returning to Singapore in 1950 with a law degree from the University of Cambridge, he began working with the unions.

Mr Lee was elected to the Legislative Assembly of pre-independent Singapore in 1955, and became Prime Minister of self-governing Singapore in 1959. He led the country through the merger with Malaysia in 1963, and separation from it in 1965. He was the driving force behind Singapore’s transformation from a Third World country to First. After stepping down as Prime Minister in 1990, Mr Lee continued to serve in the Cabinet until 2011 when he was 87 years old. He has been recognised as Asia’s pre-eminent statesman — one among the giants who spurred Asia’s rise in the 20th century.
Our cover story is a tribute to Mr Lee’s contributions to Singapore, his international stature, and the ideals and convictions that shaped him and his generation of leaders.

The Formative Years (1923 –1950)
Lee Kuan Yew was born on 16 September 1923 in Singapore. He was the top student from Raffles Institution in the Senior Cambridge examinations of 1940. He then entered Raffles College with the hopes of going on to study law in London, but his plans were interrupted by World War II.
After the British surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, Mr Lee narrowly escaped being killed in sook ching (“purge by cleansing”) — the Japanese army’s anti-Chinese operation which took the lives of many Chinese. He had gone to the Jalan Besar sook ching screening, but sensing something was wrong, he excused himself from the line-up. He hid with his gardener’s help and fortuitously cleared the screening the next day. He later recalled that he did not choose to enter politics; it was the Japanese occupation that brought politics to him. The brutal occupation forced him to realise that unless Singaporeans took their fate into their own hands, they would forever be at the mercy of major powers.

University of Cambridge and the Malayan Forum
Lee Kuan Yew resumed his studies after World War II. He first enrolled at the London School of Economics, and then moved to the University of Cambridge in 1947. He graduated from Cambridge with “Double First” honours in Law and received the only star for distinction in his year.

While in England, Mr Lee joined the Malayan Forum together with Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye, who would later form the PAP with him. The Forum was a group of politically conscious Malayan students in Britain who were working towards an independent Malaya, which would include Singapore. Mr Lee returned home after being called to the Bar in June 1950.
""The time has come for Malayans to unite, for we can’t stop this exploitation unless we are masters in our own country. So that is the first thing that has to be put right. We’ve got to have independence.""
– Lee Kuan Yew, at an election rally, 21 March 1955
Road to Merdeka (1950 –1965)
Legal adviser to trade unions
In 1952, Lee Kuan Yew represented the Postal and Telecommunications Uniformed Staff Union in its salary negotiations with the colonial government. He exposed the high-handedness with which the postal workers had been treated, but advised them to adopt a peaceful, moderate approach in the negotiations. Mr Lee gained wide publicity after he succeeded in negotiating a better deal for the postal workers. Soon, more trade unions and clan associations began approaching him to be their advocate.
At the Singaporean Union of Postal and Telecommunication Workers' premises for the PAP's Special Party Conference, 3 February 1955. It was decided at the meeting at the PAP would contest the upcoming Legislative Assembly Election. Four candidates, including Lee Kuan Yew, were fielded.
Formation of the People’s Action Party (PAP)
Together with a small group of students who had recently returned from England, Lee Kuan Yew developed the idea of forming a political party to fight for independence through constitutional means. This group — Toh Chin Chye, Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam and Kenneth Byrne, joined later by Samad Ismail and Devan Nair — met regularly in the basement dining room of Mr Lee’s home in Oxley Road.
The Fajar trial
In 1954, Lee Kuan Yew was approached to defend eight University of Malaya students who had been charged with sedition for publishing an article in Fajar, an undergraduate magazine. Together with Queen’s Counsel D. N. Pritt, Mr Lee defended the students successfully. Soon after, he represented Chinese middle-school students who were appealing their conviction for rioting over National Service registration. This was Mr Lee’s introduction to the Chinese educated world. As he described it, it was “a world teeming with vitality, dynamism and revolution”.
Greeting Queen's Counsel D. N. Pritt at the airport, 1954. Pritt had own in to represent eight University of Malaya students charged with sedition for an article published in Fajar, an undergraduate publication. All eight were acquitted.
Inauguration of the PAP
Through these students, Lee Kuan Yew became acquainted with Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan, two influential figures in the Communist United Front. Mr Lee told them of his plans to form a political party, and they soon joined the Oxley Road group. On 21 November 1954 the PAP was inaugurated at the Victoria Memorial Hall.
The 1955 Legislative Assembly Election
The PAP put up four candidates, including Lee Kuan Yew. The PAP won three seats, with Mr Lee himself winning the largest number of votes cast for any candidate. He had emerged as the natural leader of the anti-colonial movement.

""Once in a long while in the history of a people, there comes a moment of great change. Tonight is such a moment in our lives... We begin a new chapter in the history of Singapore. The powers of the people through their elected government are limited to our internal affairs. It is not what we really want. It is but a step forward towards merger and Merdeka.""
– Lee Kuan Yew, at a mass rally following the PAP’s victory in the 1959 Singapore General Election, 3 June 1959
Open front alliance
Lee Kuan Yew and his non-communist colleagues in the PAP felt they had to forge an alliance with the communists to fight colonialism. But this meant a constant tussle for control within the PAP. Mr Lee secretly met Fong Chong Pik, a representative of the Malayan Communist Party whom he named “the Plen”, short for Plenipotentiary, in his Battle for Merger talks.

The 1959 General Election
The PAP took 43 out of 51 seats in Singapore’s first general election for a fully-elected legislature. It was a landslide win. Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of self-governing Singapore. He began immediately implementing the far-reaching social and economic policies that transformed the island over the next few decades.

Independence through merger
In May 1961, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, announced the possibility of a merger with Singapore. Disagreement over this issue prompted a split in the PAP in July 1961. The pro-communists led by Lim Chin Siong first tried to bring down the government in the Legislative Assembly. When they failed, they broke away to form the Barisan Sosialis. The trade unions also split — those loyal to the PAP formed the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), while the pro-communist unions set up the Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU).
This resulted in a fierce battle for the hearts and minds of Singaporeans. Lee Kuan Yew made a series of radio broadcasts to expose the communists — their aims, methods and organisation — and visited all 51 constituencies. A referendum was held in September 1962 in which the PAP’s proposal for merger with the Federation won 71 percent of the votes. A year later, on 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of Malaysia. Five days after Merger, the PAP won 37 seats in the 1963 General Elections, compared to the Barisan Socialis’ 13. The PAP — with Mr Lee’s “superb political generalship,” as Dr Goh Keng Swee later described it — had survived the communist onslaught.

Merger, however, turned out to be an unhappy experience. The PAP contested the 1964 Malaysian General Election, but won only one seat in the peninsula.

""I have a responsibility for the survival of the two million people in Singapore... my overriding, my paramount duty is the survival of my own people... I am determined that they will survive and I think they’ve got enough grit in them.""
– Lee Kuan Yew, interview with foreign correspondents, 14 August 1965
Survival and Nationhood (1965 –1990)
This period has been closely identified with Lee Kuan Yew’s leadership and strength of character. Assisted by a group of exceptionally able colleagues, he transformed Singapore into a progressive, open and economically successful nation.
Obtaining international recognition for Singapore
Lee Kuan Yew believed that it was most important to position Singapore in the international system. Before Singapore’s independence, he had already been meeting key figures of that time (including Nehru, Nasser and Tito) and leading missions to Africa and Australia on behalf of Malaysia. He put this experience to good use as soon as Singapore became independent.
Rule of law and non-corruptibility
Lee Kuan Yew initiated constitutional changes and adapted the rule of law to the local context. He insisted on high standards of probity in government and was relentless in fighting corruption. He believed the success of the country depended on the strength and integrity of its institutions, particularly the civil service and the judiciary.
A Singaporean Singapore
Lee Kuan Yew envisioned a meritocratic, multiracial, multi-religious and multi-lingual society, where no one would be favoured or discriminated against because of their race, language or religion. He shunned race-based political parties and stressed the importance of racial and religious harmony. In education, he instituted bilingualism with English as the medium of instruction and with Mandarin, Malay and Tamil as the mother tongues. There shall be no majorities or minorities in Singapore, he declared soon after Separation. He combated chauvinism in all its forms.
Building a defence force
To ensure Singapore’s security, Lee Kuan Yew worked closely with Defence Minister Goh Keng Swee to build up the Singapore Armed Forces. In 1967, he introduced compulsory National Service for all 18-year-old male citizens. 900 full-time National Servicemen were enlisted in the first batch that year.
Surviving without the British military
In the 1960s, the British military bases contributed about 20 percent to Singapore’s Gross Domestic Product. After the British announced in 1968 they were withdrawing their forces “East of Suez”, Lee Kuan Yew negotiated with British leaders a generous aid package and a postponement of the date British forces would leave Singapore, from March to December 1971. He also set up the Bases Economic Conversion Department, led by Hon Sui Sen, to oversee the conversion of British military bases and facilities into commercial use. In this way, by boldly turning crisis into opportunity, Singapore survived the British withdrawal. That was to become a hallmark of Mr Lee’s leadership as Singapore tackled the crises of the 1970s and 1980s.
""We cannot go backwards in time, to the old trading port of Singapore. We have to move forward and upwards, diversify our economy, upgrade technology in factories and offices, and increase our knowledge and skills.""
– Lee Kuan Yew, National Day Message, 8 August 1982
Establishing Singapore’s economic base
Unique among leaders of developing nations of his time, Lee Kuan Yew welcomed multi-national companies. He saw them as a means of industrialisation and to link up Singapore to the world. Central to his economic vision was the establishment of industrial harmony. Mr Lee worked closely with Devan Nair and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to promote tripartism. The National Wages Council was set up in 1972 with representatives from unions, management and government to achieve a consensus on wage issues.
Creating a financial centre
Together with Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lee Kuan Yew helped make Singapore a global financial centre. In 1967, the Board of Commissioners of Currency was established to issue the Singapore currency. In 1971, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country’s de facto central bank, was established. And in 1981, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) was formed to invest government reserves. Mr Lee served as GIC chairman from its founding till 2011.
A stake for each citizen
Giving every citizen a stake in the country was of primary importance to Lee Kuan Yew. His vision was a nation where every citizen owned a home. So he set up the Housing and Development Board to build and sell flats to Singaporeans. As wages rose, Mr Lee also raised the Central Provident Fund contribution rates to help Singaporeans buy homes and ensure they have adequate retirement savings. In 1984, he initiated Medisave, a national medical savings scheme. These schemes and institutions — HDB, CPF, Medisave — remain the bedrock of Singapore’s social policy today.

Organising the grassroots
To nurture confidence and trust between the people and the government, Lee Kuan Yew set up the People’s Association and became its first chairman. Community Centres were built all over the island to bring people together. In addition, Mr Lee launched many campaigns — from “Keep Singapore Clean and Green” to “Speak More Mandarin, Less Dialect”. He and his old Guard colleagues considered themselves to be public educators as much as political leaders.
""People must feel that Singapore is worth being part of and worth defending. Otherwise, we cease to exist... We can make Singapore a vibrant and thriving society, with opportunities for a rewarding and fulfilling life. ""
–Lee Kuan Yew, National Day Message, 8 August 1989
Establishing international relations
Lee Kuan Yew helped Singapore establish strong relations with major powers like the United States, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom. He welcomed the United States as a stabilising force in the Asia-Pacific region. His rapport with Deng Xiaoping led to the strengthening of ties with China from the 1980s. Mr Lee was well received by the top world leaders of his time.
Meeting United States President Ronald Reagan at the White House, 19 June 1981. Lee Kuan Yew had met every US president since Lyndon Johnson.

The Commonwealth and ASEAN
Lee Kuan Yew ensured Singapore’s voice was heard on the world stage. Singapore hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1971, with Mr Lee as the chairman. Together with his Foreign Minister S Rajaratnam, Mr Lee was a strong supporter of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which he viewed as important to regional stability.
Placing Singapore on the world map
Mr Lee took a personal interest in Singapore Airlines (SIA), and urged it to focus on international rather than regional routes. His decision to build Changi International Airport, which opened in 1981, helped Singapore become the air hub of the region.
A clean and green Singapore
Mr Lee believed in a clean and green environment. He was the inspiration and chief architect of Singapore’s transformation into a “garden city”, and later into a “city in a garden”. The clean-up of the Singapore River and the Kallang River basin — a massive project that took 10 years to complete — together with the waterways, parks and trees that dot Singapore’s landscape are among the most enduring of Mr Lee’s achievements.
Inspecting the Singapore River, 2 September 1987. Lee Kuan Yew considered the decade-long project to clean up the river one of his most ambitious undertakings.
The water story
Singapore’s dependence on Malaysia for its water was a matter of profound importance. Lee Kuan Yew was the key figure in all bilateral talks with Malaysia over water. Thanks to his leadership, Singapore focused on developing its own water resources. This included converting more than three- quarters of the island into water catchment areas, developing desalination plants and introducing NEWater or reclaimed water.
Leadership succession
Lee Kuan Yew believed that the continued success of Singapore depended on having capable people in government, especially its political leadership. After the 1988 General Elections, he paved the way for Goh Chok Tong to succeed him as Prime Minister. He saw this as his final duty as Prime Minister before stepping down in 1990.
""... my values are for a government which is honest, effective and efficient in protecting its people and allowing opportunities for all to advance themselves in a stable and orderly society, where they can live a good life and raise their children to do better than themselves...""
–Lee Kuan Yew, keynote speech at the Create 21 Asahi Forum in Tokyo, 20 November 1992
His Legacy

Mr Lee had an active post-Prime Ministerial career, and his presence was felt both at home and abroad. One of the highlights of these years was the publication of his two-volume memoirs. It was translated into many languages, including Spanish, Portuguese and French, reflecting the worldwide interest in the views of Asia’s pre-eminent elder statesman.
Speaking at the launch of the second volume of his memoirs, From Third World to First, 16 September 2000.
Legacy
Lee Kuan Yew’s legacy is Singapore. He devoted every fibre of his being, the full measure of his considerable talents and energy, to the betterment of his fellow citizens. He believed in a fair and just society, one in which every citizen had a stake. He believed we could be “one united people, regardless of race, language or religion”. He believed government had to be honest and strong if it was to be a force for good. He thus insisted on the rule of law, meritocracy and zero tolerance of corruption. It is upon these solid foundations laid by Lee Kuan Yew and his generation of leaders that Singapore will continue to thrive in the decades to come.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010
The passing of Dr Goh Keng Swee (1918–2010), who laid the foundation stones of Singapore’s economy and defence forces, has left the nation without one of its most well-respected citizens.
The National Archives of Singapore (NAS) wishes to remember and honour Dr Goh for his instrumental role in establishing the Oral History Centre within NAS in 1979. In the words of Mr Kwa Chong Guan, Chairman of the NAS Board:
""We salute and remember Dr Goh for his foresight in establishing an Oral History Centre within the National Archives of Singapore. With his support and guidance the establishment has grown to become the premier Oral History Centre in the region. We are delighted to have had the honour of interviewing Dr Goh in 1980 and look forward to releasing the interview for public consultation, in honour of Dr Goh, and to help a new generation of Singaporeans understand Dr Goh better. (May 2010)""
Apart from his oral history interview, Dr Goh’s memory has been preserved in a rich collection of oral history interviews, speeches, photographs and video recordings possessed by the National Archives of Singapore (NAS). NAS holds over 4,000 photographs of Dr Goh, 700 video clips and some 350 transcripts of public speeches of Dr Goh. These materials are available to the general public for viewing.
Dr Goh was among the most important members of Singapore’s founding generation of leaders. He played a critical role as Minister of Finance in the crucial early years from 1959-65 and from 1967-70 laying the groundwork for Singapore’s subsequent economic development. Though on hindsight Singapore’s economy could appear to follow a clear progressive path, at that time, the task to build an economy was fraught with grave uncertainty, as Dr Goh said in this 1969 speech:
""When my [PAP] government first assumed office on June 3rd 1959..... businessmen and industrialists, far from hailing this event as a happy augury for the future, felt for the most part that the end of the world was around the corner. The stock market collapsed and there was a flight of capital out of Singapore. Several people fled the country. [But] In a short space of ten years, we brought about a transformation of the business climate.""1

Among Dr Goh’s many achievements in helping to bring about this transformation was his role in establishing the Economic Development Board (EDB) in 1961, the Jurong Industrial Estate in 1962 (which he promoted in spite of severe public criticism, though it turned out to be the right move) and the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) in 1968. These institutions have made, and continue to make, vital contributions to Singapore’s economic success.

The unpromising ground and distance of Jurong from Singapore's town and port led the project's detractors to term it ""Goh's Folly"". However, the Jurong Industrial Estate turned out to be a great success. By 1976, 650 factories were in operation in Jurong, which became central to independent Singapore's industrialization.

Dr Goh was also responsible for developing the economic strategy that is crucial to explaining Singapore’s economic takeoff. Between 1959 and 1965, he advocated an import-substitution strategy and positioned Singapore as a manufacturing centre supplying the common Malaysian market. Following Singapore’s independence in 1965, Dr Goh realised the futility of keeping to this plan and began promoting an export-oriented developmental strategy. By adopting this export-oriented strategy, he went against influential economic theories circulating in the 1960s and 1970s which asserted that state protectionism and heavy government expenditure was necessary to spur growth in emerging economies.
Dr Goh formulated policies which resulted in Singapore adopting an open economy that encouraged free trade, competition and foreign direct investment by multi-national corporations, while encouraging economic thrift and prudence by the Singapore government and people.2

Dr Goh was also convinced that successful economic development depended on the determination, initiative, enterprise and self-reliance of a people and that good government should encourage these qualities. He outlined these convictions in a speech to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in 1969:
""We in Singapore believe in hard work. We believe that enterprise should be rewarded and not penalised. We believe that we must adjust ourselves to changing situations. We believe in seizing economic opportunities and not let them go past us. Finally, we believe in self-reliance.....These are human qualities that have helped to transform an island-swamp into a thriving metropolis. They are the traditional virtues of Singaporeans and so long as we retain these virtues, we can face the future with confidence.""2
Dr Goh’s convictions were proved correct and his thought remains a cornerstone of Singapore’s economic policy.
Following Singapore’s separation from Malaysia in August 1965, Dr Goh handed the Ministry of Finance over to his successor Mr Lim Kim San and took up the position of Minister of Defence. As Minister of Defence, Dr Goh was tasked to secure Singapore’s national borders from both internal and external threats. A government gazette released in October 1965 stated that his field of responsibility included “Security, Law and Order, Defence, National Service...People’s Association, Vigilante Corps”.4

Dr Goh’s most immediate and important task as Defence Minister was to build a credible Singapore armed forces, literally from scratch, in double quick time. Dr Goh was convinced that a strong Singapore army was necessary to secure the country’s independence:
""British military protection today has made quite a number of our citizens complacent about the need to conduct our own defence preparations. These people assume that this protection will be permanent. I regard it as the height of folly to plan our future on this assumption and, indeed, the only rational basis on which we, as an independent country, can plan its future is on the opposite assumption....Nobody, neither we nor the British can say when this will be....[but] whatever the time may be, it would be useless then to think about building up our defence forces.""5
Dr Goh succeeded in this daunting challenge, and in the process laid the foundations of one of the most important and successful Singapore state institutions in a mere six years. Many ideas and institutions on which the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is built were put in place during Dr Goh’s tenure, for instance a conscript army and compulsory national service for young men.6 He believed that Singapore citizens should participate directly as soldiers in their country’s defence to reinforce their sense of responsibility to the national community and to strengthen their bonds with one another as countrymen. Dr Goh thought that this was especially important as Singapore as a new nation populated by migrants of diverse origins and particularistic interests did not possess a strong national consciousness:
""Throughout man’s long history, defence of the community has always been regarded as a noble duty. In the process of integrating loose collections of people into a nation with a strong sense of identity, military service has played a significant role. From the Greek City States of the fifth century B.C. to the twentieth century continental super powers, we have seen how the development of the national consciousness has been so often centred around service in the defence force... In Singapore, we are not yet a close knit community, so many of our people are of recent migrant origin. All this goes towards creating a sense of values which is personal, self-centred with anti-social tendencies where a conflict arises between personal interests and social obligations. These are the values of a rootless parvenu society. We cannot hope to remove them overnight, but in the process of creating a stronger national consciousness among our people, we will find that military service will play an important role..""7
When Dr Goh gave up his defence portfolio in 1979 he left Singapore with we a well-rounded citizen army containing commando units, armoured battalions and an air force8  – the core of a modern army – when previously Singapore had nothing.
Besides defence and economic matters, Dr Goh also made significant contributions to Singapore in the field of education. Between 1979 and 1985 he was put in charge of the Ministry of Education where he introduced important reforms. The influential Goh Report, released in 1979 under Dr Goh’s supervision, examined the challenges facing the education system and detailed recommendations that would profoundly influence its future direction. Notably, the current practice of ‘streaming’ in schools was introduced through the report, with the purpose of helping all students develop their potential more fully, in particular the weaker students.9 As Dr Goh explained:
""Our system of education, lasting twelve years, has been tailored to suit the brightest 12% of students. The inevitable result is high wastage rates in our schools, both primary and secondary. Automatic promotion was practiced in primary and secondary schools up to 1975 and 1977 respectively. This means that as the slow learners moved from lower to higher classes, they understood less and less of what was being taught. Automatic promotion for Primary and Secondary schools was abolished in 1976 and 1978 respectively and retentions enforced on a large scale. This did not produce the results hoped for. Retention inflicts a psychological trauma on the child and when this is repeated two or three times, it would be an exceptional child who does not lose interest in learning, suffer a loss of self-esteem and self-confidence and develop character defects as a consequence of these. ...We must accept the principle of teaching children of different leaning capacities at different rates. The Report recommends different streams of education to suit the slow, average, above average and outstanding learners.""10
Dr Goh was appointed Deputy Prime Minister between 1973 and 1979, and from 1980 to 1985 he was made First Deputy Prime Minister, the position from which he retired from public life in 1985.

Between 1980 and 1985, he was made Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), where he spearheaded major organisational and professional improvements. He also came up with the idea in 1981 that Singapore’s national reserves should be managed by a specialised and professional investment management body that led to the formation of Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation (GIC) in which he served as Deputy Chairman between 1981 and 1994.11

Apart from these achievements, Dr Goh was responsible for initiating or founding a diverse mix of other Singapore institutions, reflecting his remarkably broad range of interests. He championed the establishment of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (setup in 1968), the Jurong Bird Park and the Singapore Zoological Gardens (opened in 1971 and 1973 respectively), and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (setup in 1978). He conceived the idea of transforming the island of Pulau Blakang Mati, which was renamed ‘Sentosa’ in 1968, from a military base into a tourist and leisure resort – an idea which has come to full cycle with the opening of the Sentosa Integrated Resorts in 2010. He also laid the groundwork for the creation of the Singapore Totalisator Board which was established in 1988.12 Following his retirement, the government of the People’s Republic of China sought out Dr Goh’s expertise and appointed him as its economic adviser on coastal development and tourism in 1985. Dr Goh was the first foreigner to be appointed to such a role – a testament to the international recognition he had garnered for his accomplishments.
Dr Goh was not only an exceptional Minister. He was a humble and humane person, compassionate for the needs of the less fortunate and deeply interested in social issues. He had in fact started his career as a social researcher at the Social Welfare Department (SWD), which he had chosen to join at the end of the Japanese Occupation in 1945, although the SWD was then a small organisation with little prestige in the civil service. As a young officer in the SWD he played a central role in organising the People’s Kitchens during the British Military Administration (1945- 46). The People’s Kitchens provided very low-cost but nutritious meals which ensured that fewer people went hungry during those difficult years.
Though a relatively junior officer at the time, his keenly analytical mind and wry wit were already evident. This is a passage taken from the preface of a Report on Urban Incomes and Housing which Dr Goh prepared in 1956 when he was Assistant Director of Social Welfare (Social Research) at the SWD:
""I should like to make clear at the beginning the essentially limited scope of the work. Those looking for a penetrating analysis of Singapore’s social problems, covering all aspects in one broad and majestic sweep will look here in vain. This study does not go further than describing some of the things which a team of investigators discovered and reported in the course of five months of field work. Further, it is in the nature of sample surveys to be primarily concerned with the numerical estimation of quantities and relations between quantities....the task of presenting and explaining figures, even when successfully accomplished, does not result in the production of exciting literature. There is, further a class of people to be considered who, doubtless as a result of their early experience in mathematics in school, recoil with horror when confronted by a row of figures. I have great sympathy for such people and have reduced the use of figures in the text of the report to a minimum...I have tried, I hope successfully, to resist the temptation of speculating outside the range of the Survey evidence. Those with fewer inhibitions than myself are welcome to try their hand at this game.""13

To gather fresh data for this report, Dr Goh and his researchers personally interviewed the head of each of the 6,804 households sampled.14 Dr Goh’s method, which stressed detailed field work, gave him and his team a first-hand feel of the ground which led to new insight into the issues studied. As Ms Tan Siok Sun, his daughter-in-law and biographer wrote, “GKS and his researchers ate with the trishaw drivers who they discovered rented not rooms, but beds in the Chinatown area. He learnt that a single bed would be shared by two ‘tenants’, one doing the day shift and the other the night shift”.15
Despite the high office to which he rose and his exceptional talents, Dr Goh always remained a man of simple needs, lived a simple and frugal existence, and was ever ready to humble himself to relate with and aid his fellow men. His wife Dr Phua Swee Liang recalled,
""In his dealings with people, Keng Swee makes no distinction between race, religion, gender, wealth, or power provided they are genuine and decent. Regardless of how simple a view or need might be, he would lend a ear if it is expressed honestly and truthfully. His compassion and thoughtfulness for the common man have always moved and touched me...He has always led a simple and frugal life whether in his official capacity or in private life... Whenever he was warded in hospital, he would tear each tissue paper he wanted to use carefully into halves. He would then put one half back into the box for future use and use the other half. He would often chide me for being a wastrel when he saw that I used the whole sheet and added, ‘its taxpayer’s money’...[but] when the Dover Road Hospice asked for a donation of S$5,000 to purchase an electronic wheelchair for a patient, he wrote the cheque without a second thought.""16
His daughter-in-law, Ms Tan Siok Sun also recalled,
""Many who worked with him {Dr Goh} feared him, even those with high intellect and who were clearly competent in their respective fields. His reputation preceded him and followed him to the various ministries that he was put in charge of. Yet these same people respected his towering intellect and the common refrain was that he was a great mentor, and a remarkably patient teacher.""17
His outstanding human qualities won him the esteem of even his political adversaries, like the late David Marshall, the famous lawyer, first Chief Minister of Singapore, and critic of the Singapore government. Marshall paid this warm tribute to Dr Goh in an Oral History Interview he conducted with the National Archives of Singapore in 1984:
""Keng Swee was ....a man of ‘sea-green’ integrity, a man of personal charm and warmth if you got close to him, very humble. Genuinely, no showmanship about it, genuinely humble....he speaks to the high as well as to the low....with the same approach. He had an extraordinary....total freedom from arrogance, from superiority, from any inferiority; he just was....a natural human being. And to me, a perfect human being.....it’s so much part of the air he breathes....to serve his country and his fellow human beings. And never a lie from him, never any malice from him...always treating me with courtesy and consideration. Never because I was a political opponent, treated me with ....unpleasant [ness]....never at all.""18

Back then, horse carriages and rickshaws were mainstays in transporting goods and people from the docks to the commercial city centre. (c.1900. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Johnston’s Pier
Johnston’s Pier was the predecessor to what most people would recognise as Clifford Pier today. It was officially opened on 13 March 1856 to help cope with the increase in sea-traffic, and was the first pier in Singapore that extended from the shore out to the sea.
Named after Alexander Laurie Johnston, one of Singapore’s earliest European settlers, Johnston’s Pier was also affectionately known as Lampu Merah (Malay) or Ang Teng (Hokkien), which means “Red Lamp”. This was in reference to the red lantern hung at the end of the pier that served as a warning for incoming sea-faring vessels.
Besides regular trade and transport functions, Johnston’s Pier was also the site of the annual New Year Regatta. This photo is credited back to 1900 and sees Malay kolek lumb all set for a race. (1996-00053. Image from National Museum of Singapore)

Becoming Clifford Pier
In 1927, Johnston’s Pier size was deemed inadequate to handle the volume of traffic, leading to the construction of Clifford Pier that was officially opened on 3 June 1933 by then Governor of the Straits Settlements Cecil Clementi.
Designed in the Art-Deco style by Frank Dorrington Ward, Clifford Pier measured 204-foot long by 110-foot wide and was noted for the distinguishable concrete arched truss that enveloped the exterior.

Clifford Pier was also conveniently located just beside Commercial Square (today’s Raffles Place) and more importantly, Change Alley, a popular area for many sailing crews who patronised its moneychangers and inexpensive goods. Over the years, Clifford Pier would continually experience transformation, from its post-war renovation in 1949, to its own version of “pop-up stores” in the form of street hawkers appearing in the Pier’s carpark late at night that catered to musicians and revelers looking for a taste of the city.
The Art-Deco elements of Clifford Pier are visible from far, along with the carpark that would be crowded with street hawkers once nightfall came. (c. mid-20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
The most major changes to Clifford Pier that we see today started back in 1970 with an S$120,000 facelift to introduce new shopping and office spaces to the area. In 1973, the S$7-million Change Alley Aerial Plaza – an air-conditioned shopping complex that connected Clifford Pier to Change Alley was built.
1978 also saw the introduction of the iconic Red Lantern Revolving Restaurant, while the 1980s would see Clifford Pier transition into an embarkation point for people looking to reach the Southern Islands. The pier became particularly packed during the ninth lunar month when devotees headed to Kusu Island for their annual pilgrimage.
Come 1973, a slew of changes, most notably the S$7 million building of the Change Alley Aerial Plaza were built to cater to the increase in traffic and commercialisation around Clifford Pier. (c.1970s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)

Clifford Pier today
On 1 April 2006, the last bumboat left Clifford Pier for its relocation to Marina South Pier to make way for the construction of the Marina Barrage. On 14 March 2007, it was granted conservation status, with many of its architectural features preserved. Today, Clifford Pier is part of the Fullerton Heritage Project, highlighted by its transformation to The Fullerton Bay Hotel that provides dining and hospitality options to visitors along the Singapore waterfront.

(c.1988. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Whether it was scaling the treacherous Peng Kang Hill in Jurong, being part of the pioneer batches trained by the Israeli Army, or simply taking the ferry from Tanah Merah to Pulau Tekong, the memories of National Service still resonate very much in the minds of the over 900,000 male citizens who have completed their National Service (NS) duty ever since it was introduced under the National Service (Amendment) Bill in 1967.
Before Conscription
Prior to the NS Bill of ’67, the British had actually tabled their own bill back in 1952, on the grounds that a nation seeking self-government should be able to defend itself. The Ordinance was enacted on 1 March 1954, and required males between the ages of 18 and 20 to register for part-time national service. The first 1,000 national servicemen were chosen via public ballot on July 1954, and were drafted into the Singapore Military Forces and Civil Defence Corps.
Protest by Chinese Middle School students would however see a quick end to the bill, highlighted by a demonstration on 13 May where some 500 students held a protest against the bill by marching to the Government House. They eventually clashed with the police, resulting in 26 injuries and 45 arrests. The incident slowed down the enlistment process greatly, and the National Service Ordinance eventually fell through.
Introducing Conscription
The need for a capable defence force in Singapore was highlighted by two key events during its early years of independence, that of Singapore’s separation from Malaysia and the impending withdrawal of the British Military.
The monumental task was put into the hands of then Defence Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee, and began with the introduction of the Ministry of Interior and Defence (MID) in August 1965, followed by the People’s Defence Force (PDF) bill on 30 December on the same year. By March 1966, some 3,200 volunteers had already registered with the PDF, but their lack of military training and small numbers soon made Goh realise that compulsory conscription was needed to vastly expand Singapore’s defence force.

In 1965, Goh was appointed the Minister of Defence and was handed the daunting task of building up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch. (c.1966. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
On 14 March 1967, when the second reading of the National Service (Amendment) Bill and was passed, Goh declared that an initial batch of some 9,000 male youths born between 1 January 1949 and 30 July 1949 would be eligible for their National Service callup.
The enlistees would serve in one of four branches, namely the full-time army, PDF, Vigilante Corps and Special Constabulary. Those that were not selected for the army were allocated to the other divisions where they did only part-time training during their off duty hours, ensuring minimal disruption to their other career pursuits.

Early years of National Service
The first batches of eligible NS enlistees were registered at four stations located at Kallang, Katong, Serangoon and Bukit Panjang during the period between 28 March and 18 April 1967. All important documents had to be presented, and failure to register would result in an imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of S$2,000, or both.
In the early years of National Service, a lack of knowledge and amenities would see the pioneer batches trained by members from the Israeli Armed Forces, together with limited equipment as well as the iconic No.4 uniforms made from “Temasek Green cotton drill” – known to be so highly starched and pressed that they were able to stand on their own!
The iconic No.4 uniform worn my army personnel has undergone numerous changes. Seen here is the first-ever batch of uniforms made from “Temasek Green cotton drill.”(c.1969. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
In 1970, the MID would diversify its operations, leading to the establishment of the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to oversee all military related matters.

Evolution of National Service
Over the years, National Service would also experience numerous changes and improvements, including the introduction of the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) in 1980 as well as changes to the Basic Military Training (BMT) structure to accommodate enlistees who were either obese (1991) or achieved inadequate results in their IPPT (1993).
Since 1980, the fitness of enlistees is determined by their Performance in the Individual Physical Proficiency Test. (c.2000. Image from National Archives of Singapore)
Today, there are a total of over 40 army camps, 2 naval bases and nine air force bases around the island equipped with the latest technology and facilities that have made the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) a well-respected army the world over. Beyond regular training of National Serviceman, the SAF has also been readily involved in providing aid at critical junctures both in Singapore (Laju incident in 1974, Hotel New World Collapse in 1986) as well as humanitarian relief efforts overseas (Medical Mission to East Pakistan in 1970, “Operation Flying Eagle” for the Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami in 2004).

Having been sacked from their jobs after deploying adversarial tactics demanding better employment terms, 229 workers from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company took to the streets on 25 April 1955. Accompanied by students from Chinese middle schools as well as other sympathisers, the mob picketed bus stops and a depot in an attempt to urge other bus drivers to join their cause.
The strike eventually erupted into a full-blown riot comprising 2,000 people on May 12 the same year. By the end of the violent clashes, four people had lost their lives, and 31 were injured.

A brewing conflict
In a bid to improve labour and employment terms, left-wing trade unions began rallying workers to demand change from their employers in 1955. Tactics they suggested tended to be militant in nature.1
Chief Minister David Marshall speaking with Fong Swee Suan, the secretary of SBWU, who was under emergency detention for his involvement in the bus riots. (c1955. Image from the National Archives of Singapore)
Among the groups insisting on change was the Singapore Bus Workers’ Union (SBWU). Under trade unionist Fong Swee Suan, the SBWU had by February that year garnered the support of 250 drivers from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company.2 The bus company’s response was to dismiss two branch officials under its employ.
Complicating matters was the establishment of a new group called the Hock Lee Bus Employees’ Union which the SBWU suspected had been initiated by the company itself. The new union comprised spare drivers who were paid a retainer fee of $2 a day.3
When 100 Hock Lee ground staff took a day off on 24 March to attend an SBWU meeting, the company viewed it as a mass resignation. It then dispatched workers from the Hock Lee Bus Employees’ Union to take over their duties.
On 24 April 1955, dissatisfaction with the company reached a tipping point when 229 workers, all SBWU members, were dismissed at one go.4 Over the next two days, the unhappy drivers picketed the company’s Alexandra Road bus depot and stopped buses from plying the roads, urging drivers to join them in their cause.5
A failed negotiation
Then Chief Minister David Marshall attempted to mitigate between SBWU and the Hock Lee Bus Company. The workers initially agreed to go back to work, but Fong Swee Swan, the union secretary, backed out of the agreement.6
With negotiations failing, strikes continued. On 11 May 1955, the police used high-pressure water jets to break up the angry mob.7

A day marked by violence
The situation intensified and climaxed on 12 May. When police deployed water hoses on rioting workers and Chinese students8, who also had grievances with the government and sympathised with the workers, they hit back with bricks and stones.
The day of violence ended with four people dead and 31 injured.9 Among the casualties was a 16-year-old student by the name of Chong Lon Chong who had been shot in the commotion and paraded around by protestors as an example of police brutality, delaying potentially life-saving treatment, and a volunteer constable who had been attacked with a garden hoe.10
Numerous protestors were detained by the police for their involvement in the riots. (c1955. Image from the National Archives of Singapore
The riot subsided in the early hours of 13 May. Working fast, the government closed three Chinese middle schools – the Chinese High School, Chung Cheng High School and its branch school – later in the day.
On 14 May, an agreement was reached between the bus company, SBWU and the Hock Lee Bus Employees’ Union. SBWU’s terms included the appointment of an arbitrator as well as the dissolution of the Hock Lee Bus Employees’ Union. The arbitrator eventually ruled in favour of SBWU and 85 of the Hock Lee Bus Employees’ Union’s 170 workers were dismissed.11

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/tiong-bahru-hip-heritage-neighbourhood/story,"TL;DR
The Instagram-worthy neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru — where some apartments command $1 million in the resale market — was once swamp land. In the 1930s, the British-run Singapore Improvement Trust transformed it into a housing estate to address overcrowding in the colony.
Replete with charming Art Deco blocks, Tiong Bahru has gone from strength to strength. In 2003 it was conserved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and began attracting a new crowd.1 It also caught the eye of foreign media which accorded it titles such as world’s coolest neighbourhood.2
Flats built by the Singapore Improvement Trust. (c1960s–1980s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
From dank swamp to housing haven
The land around Tiong Bahru Road was hilly, swampy and filled with disused graveyards. It sprung to life when settlers, forming a village called Kampong Tiong Bahru, began moving in, precipitated by the construction of a hospital (the present-day Singapore General Hospital) in nearby Outram in 1882.3
By the 1920s, the disorderly nature of the village and its unsanitary, hazardous living conditions began alarming health officials and the press. An editorial in The Straits Times dated 26 June 1930 went so far as to describe it as an “evil-smelling swamp”.4
“…the land was practically all evil-smelling swamp, several feet below sea-level, with a dirty-looking creek running through it to the Singapore River. There were three fairly large hills on the far side from the main roads, and on these were numerous hovels, filthy and insanitary, occupied by squatters of the pig-breeding and coolie types.”
- A scathing review of the Tiong Bahru area which appeared in The Straits Times on 26 June 1930.
In 1931, the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) decided that the time was ripe to transform the site into a more liveable area. It was also part of a larger push by the authorities to construct mass housing for Singapore’s burgeoning population. The city was, after all, reeling from the side effects of slumlike living conditions — disease was rife and mortality rates were high across the colony — factors that could repel businesses and traders.
The SIT thus set out to clear the slums, reclaim the swamp, and prepare the land for a developer to build homes.5 The Trust had even carved out roads named after popular philanthropists such as Khoo Tiong Poh, Koh Eng Hoon and Seah Eu Chin.6
A report by the Singapore Improvement Trust. The British agency filled in swamps and levelled 72 acres of land in Tiong Bahru. The name Tiong Bahru is a combination of Hokkien and Malay words which mean new cemetery. (c. 1948. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Unfortunately, few developers took bait, the economy having only just recovered from a recession.7The SIT thus had little choice but to construct the housing estate on its own.8

More than 780 flats, inspired by modern European concepts of public housing, as well as British new towns like Stevenage, Harlow and Crawley, were completed between the years 1936 and 1941.10

Unfortunately, this first wave of construction, where tenants were charged $25 a month, did little to resolve Singapore’s public housing scarcity since few from the working class could afford the rent.
Block 78. (c1953. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Blocks added after World War II, during a second wave of development, proved to be more popular. These units were spacious, and their environment pleasant and delightful thanks to the addition of footpaths and grass plots. By 1954, the SIT had built 1,258 flats to the northern side of Tiong Bahru. By the late 1950s, it was home to 17,000 residents including ladies of the night who worked at cabarets nearby, as well as the mistresses of Chinese businessmen. Stunning streetscapes
The estate of Tiong Bahru is a head-turner, home to an enchanting mix of low-rise buildings with distinctive street corners and eye-catching art deco motifs.11
Stunning streetscapes
Its modified Streamline Moderne pre-war buildings were designed by architect Alfred G. Church. Their clean, curved lines reminded locals of Kallang Airport’s Art Deco control tower, which gave rise to the nickname “aeroplane towers”.
Tiong Bahru’s post-war structures were built in the International Style. Thoughtfully placed portholes and curved staircases help reduce the blocks’ severe appearance.12
In 2003, the Urban Redevelopment Authority decided to conserve 20 blocks. The estate’s people-first design — it being punctuated with generous pockets of open green space, five-foot ways as well as ground floor amenities to encourage neighbourly interactions — was key to this decision.13
Design accents such as fair-faced brickwork highlighting certain balconies; winding rear staircases; and green glazed glass in window and door frames imported from England to keep out the glare of the tropics, helped further seal the deal.14
In the 2010s, the estate underwent gentrification which led to a surge in interest from a new generation of Singaporeans with spending power. In August 2020, one of its units fetched more than $1 million in the resale market.16

The beloved National Stadium was the site of sporting triumphs and losses, celebrations and concerts. It birthed sporting legends as well as the euphoric Kallang Roar and communal Kallang Wave. Its soaring concrete frame also hosted tens of thousands of Singaporeans who, on 18 occasions, gathered in a sea of red to mark the nation’s birthday.
The site was not reserved for Singaporeans alone. When international headliners such as Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey took the stage, music fans from across the region descended upon the arena in Kallang to get in on the action. Built for the people, the venue took its final bow in 2011 — 38 years after it was completed, closing the chapter on what was once Southeast Asia's largest stadium.

A shot in the arm for Singapore’s sports scene
Apart from new flats and factories, freshly independent Singapore was soon to get its first Olympic-standard stadium. It was December 1965 and Minister for Culture and Social Affairs Othman Wok had just recommended the construction of such a venue during a budget debate in parliament.
It must have been a fairly tough crowd to convince — sports was low on the list of priorities for the fledgling new nation. But Mr Othman justified it as an investment for the people, arguing that it would spark a sporting culture and place Singapore at the ”forefront in the field of international sport”.1 The cost of the project could be partially covered by proceeds from a legalised lottery, he added.2
His proposal was given the go-ahead and work began a year later in Kallang with Mr Othman driving in the first pile for the $50 million endeavour.

The stadium, the largest in Southeast Asia upon completion, had a barebones Brutalist design. Open-air with a concrete structural frame, it also housed state-of-the art features.3
In 1973, Singapore pulled out all the stops for its grand opening. An Olympic torch was shot into the night sky, trumpets were sounded and a 1,000-strong choir sang for the crowd. In his opening address, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew shared that while the stadium was a massive financial undertaking, it could become a “great” social asset if it was “fully and properly used”.4

A packed calendar
The people responded well to the stadium. It was a timely addition to the city and a vast improvement to the 10,000-seater Jalan Besar stadium, which failed to meet international standards.
The same year, the grand dame played host to the 7th Southeast Asian Peninsular Games as well as boxing world champion Muhammad Ali for exhibitions bouts as part of his tour of the Far East.
It was also the holy ground of football. Fans of team Singapore snapped up tickets during the 1970s, 1980s and mid-1990s to watch the Lions take on their rivals in the Malaysia Cup.5 From the stands, they cheered on their favourite players to sizzling, nail-biting finishes and were treated to gravity-defying kicks and great sportsmanship. This explained the thunderous roars, also known as the Kallang Roar, emanating from its grounds. It was at this very arena that football legends such as Quah Kim Song, Dollah Kassim, Fandi Ahmad and Varadarju Sundramoorthy, were born.6
The applause was not reserved for football heroes alone. Music fans kept their ears pricked for concerts by mega pop stars at the venue. They were not disappointed by the stadium’s entertainment line-up. The venue, with its 55,000 pax capacity, attracted headliners and big stars like Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson and A-mei. It was also the venue of choice for religious rallies and community events such as when Pope John Paul II visited in 1986.
Indeed, the stadium had something for everyone.
Some add that it was “unrivalled as a venue for the unreserved expression of patriotism for generations of Singaporeans”.7 Such sentiments were best experienced at all 18 editions of National Day Parades which took the stadium by storm. Singaporeans, seated snugly in the arena, bonded as they cheered on their fellow countrymen performing in mesmerising flypasts and vibrant mass displays. Dazzling fireworks ended off such heady nights.

Bowing out
The curtains came down on the grand old dame between the years 2010 and 2011 — its closure having been in the works since 2001. Following the stadium’s demolition, the present-day $1.33 billion Singapore Sports Hub, with up-to-date, world class facilities, was built in its place.8
The original landmark was closely documented during its final days, and a number of its fixtures such as turnstiles, floodlights and seats were salvaged.
Unfortunately, a time capsule with the stadium’s building plans, sports memorabilia and newspaper clippings from 23 February 1970, was never found despite the extensive use of metal detectors and a $50,000 reward.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/golden-era-of-singapore-cinema/story,"The golden era of Singapore cinema occurred within a 25-year period from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, when hundreds of films were filmed and produced in Singapore by two major film empires, Cathay Organisation and Shaw Brothers.
Shaw Brothers, a film conglomerate set up by two Shanghainese brothers, Run Run and Runme Shaw, was already operating several cinemas in both Singapore and Malaysia. The brothers decided to make their foray into the film production arm following the success of their film exhibition and screening business.
With their sights on the Malay audience in both Singapore and Malaya, Shaw reopened the Jalan Ampas studio in 1947 and incorporated a new company known as the Malay Film Productions. This would kick-start the golden era of Singapore cinema. Shaw also invested heavily, bringing in the studio system of Hollywood to Singapore, and built up their own stable of crew including directors, producers, production support, and actors.
Between 1947 and 1952, Malay Film Productions produced around 37 feature films and set a record in 1952, rolling out 23 feature films in that year alone. Indian film director B. S. Rajhan was Shaw’s only active director until 1950 and was well known for launching the film careers of many starlets such as Salleh Ghani, Rokiah Hanafi and P Ramlee.
In the following year, Loke Wan Tho created Cathay-Keris, with the help of Ho Ah Loke, who was already involved in the film exhibition businesses in northern Malaya and southern Thailand. Ho was keen to venture into film production after the end of World War II and convinced Loke to form Cathay-Keris. Cathay-Keris would become a major film studio that would challenge the monopoly of film production in the region by Shaw’s Malay Film Productions.

Cathay-Keris managed to break away from the bangsawan (a type of traditional Malay opera or theatre) influence and were the first studio to produce films shot in colour. The first two films shot in colour in Singapore were Perwira Lautan Teduh (1952) and Bulan Perindu (1953).
Cathay-Keris was most noted for initiating the Singapore-made cult classic, the Pontianak film in 1957. The film was wildly popular, and screened in cinemas for two months. It was also dubbed into Cantonese and English for the Hong Kong and American markets. Cathay-Keris quickly followed up the success of the first Pontianak with Dendam Pontianak and Sumpah Pontianak. This became known as the Pontianak trilogy that established the horror genre in Singapore and Malaya. It also launched the film careers of Maria Menado and S. M. Satay, and featured the music composed by Zubir Said, best known as the composer of Singapore’s National Anthem. Malay Film Productions would emulate the horror genre formula and launch their own Pontianak film series.

The golden era of Singapore cinema would see a turn at the 1960s, with more audiences turning to imported films from Hollywood. The introduction of television in Singapore also contributed to a decline in movie attendances. The separation of Singapore from Malaysia also led to a talent drain, with many directors, producers and artistes choosing to base themselves permanently in either side of the causeway. Ho left Cathay-Keris and Singapore, and became one of the founding fathers of Merdeka Studio in Kuala Lumpur. He also brought with him the rights to some of the most successful Cathay-Keris films. Among the starlets who chose to move to Malaysia was entertainer extraordinaire P Ramlee.

Shaw Brothers would close the Malay Film Productions studios in Singapore in 1967. Its 20-year run saw a generation of around 160 feature films produced from its Jalan Ampas studios. Cathay-Keris ceased operations in 1972, with at least a hundred films produced from its studios.
The competition between Shaw and Cathay led to the earliest developments of film production in Singapore, where hundreds of films predominantly in Malay were produced over a 25-year span. The closure of Malay Film Productions and Cathay-Keris marked the end of the golden era of Singapore cinema in the early 1970s.

At 18, P. Govindasamy Pillai ran away from home, boarding a ship in Tamil Nadu for Singapore. The early days were tough for Pillai as he struggled to find a job. When he was given the chance to work in a provision shop, Pillai wasted no time learning the ropes. Along the way he bought over the store and opened branches bearing his initials. In 1963, his business empire was valued at $3 million.

Humble beginnings
P. Govindasamy Pillai (1887–1980) was born in the village of Koorainadu in Tamil Nadu. He ran away from home in his teens and boarded a ship for Singapore, arriving in 1905 at the age of 18.1
Pillai found life in Singapore tough. He struggled to find employment and with just 13 rupees to his name, was unable to afford food and lodging.2 His circumstances improved somewhat after a provision store owner at 50 Serangoon Road got him to work in exchange for food and board. Pillai’s hours were punishing with work starting before the break of dawn and ending only after midnight.
Fully immersed in the world of provision shop operations, Pillai picked up the skills and knowledge needed to run the business fairly quickly. In 1929, he borrowed $2,000 to buy the store following the demise of its owner. It was a far-sighted move on the part of Pillai who had just gotten married. The lessons from his late employer were not forgotten and Pillai spent long hours fine-tuning and running the enterprise.3
Self-made millionaire
For the convenience of his customers, Pillai began selling a wider variety of products ranging from canned goods to shoes. He also opened branches in Little India. People began associating the P. Govindasamy Pillai name, which his business was named after, with convenience.

Although the business day was long — work started at 7am and ended around 9pm — Pillai took care of his staff. They were given two hour lunch breaks and lodging at his home.4
Having found his stride, Pillai began setting aside money to invest in other ventures. He opened flour and spice mills, and started five saree shops.5, 6 He also invested in properties in Serangoon Road, Race Course Road and Buffalo Road, and even managed to build houses in Little India.7
During the Japanese Occupation, Pillai’s family managed to escape unscathed but it was a different story for his properties which were destroyed during the war. Undeterred, Pillai began rebuilding his business empire, doing well enough to open PGP Stores in Malacca and Johor. By 1963, the year of his retirement, Pillai’s business was valued at S$3 million.
Pillai died at the ripe old age of 93 in 1980.
In 1998, the PGP Stores, having chalked up huge debts, were shuttered.
Investing in the community
Pillai, having been impoverished for a good part of his life, made it a point to help others throughout his life. In 1952, he paid for a new home for the Ramakrishna Mission Singapore, an organisation which renders aid to the needy. He also contributed generously to institutions such as Mount Alvernia Hospital and the University of Malaya.

In the 1970s, Pillai donated $300,000 towards the construction of a new gopuram (entrance tower) for the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple at Serangoon Road.8

It’s hard to imagine Singapore without the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT). With over 148 km of rail across 106 stations, an estimated 3 million people commute to work, school and other destinations on a daily basis. First open to passengers in 1987, the MRT had actually been a long time coming, with planning done as early as the 1960s.

Fueling the future
Just 2 years after Singapore’s independence, in 1967, a study was done by the Singapore State and City Planning Department and the United Nations Development Programme. It projected a population of 3.4 million by 1992 and that called for a better road network, and an efficient public transport system to cope with the increasing population.
The Singapore Mass Transit Study
As Singapore entered a new decade, traffic congestion had worsened and it became crucial to find solutions to ease the congestion. In 1972, the government sent a team of consultants and officers to start the Singapore Mass Transit Study. In its first phase, the team recommended an investment in public transportation, in particular for a rail mass transit, as the best solution to cope with the travel demands.
The second phase of the study showed that a bus-rail system was far superior to an all-bus system – economically, financially, and technically. However, whether or not to construct an MRT system was a difficult decision to make, due to the high costs and possible impacts on land use and economic activities.
The final phase of this study, conducted between 1979 and 1980, provided the first designs for the recommended transit system. With this blueprint, a Provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority was appointed in 1980 to start the first preparations for building a possible MRT system.

Light at the end of the tunnel
In May 1982, after an extensive study, the government was convinced that Singapore would greatly benefit from an MRT system and decided to build and completely finance the S$5-billion project.

Then Minister for Communications, Ong Teng Cheong, announced the decision and revealed that the MRT system would not only improve public commuting significantly, but also draw in more investors in the long run, and increase the land value in the country.
On the right track
In 1983, MRT Corporation replaced the Provisional MRT Authority and took charge of constructing and operating the MRT system. In 1987, the operations of the system were handed over to a new company called Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) Ltd.
The initial MRT system was to be 67 km long, across three lines with 42 stations: North-South Line from Yishun to Marina Bay; East-West Line from Pasir Ris to Boon Lay; and the Western Line between Jurong Town and Bukit Panjang.
The North-South Line was the first section to be constructed because this part of the city had the most commuters and congestion.
All aboard!
On 7 November 1987, a five-station segment from Toa Payoh to Yio Chu Kang opened its doors to the first passengers. Thousands of curious Singaporeans came to try out the MRT on the first day alone. A month later, on 12 December 1987, nine more stations were added from Novena to Outram Park.
Then Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, officially launched the MRT system on 12 March 1988. By April, the MRT had already become a daily mode of transport for at least 200,000 people.

Connecting every corner of Singapore
In 1996, a 16-km extension to Woodlands began serving passengers. The North East Line from Punggol through busy downtown to Harbourfront opened in 2003. The Circle Line opened all its stations in October 2011 and the Downtown Line was completed in October 2017. The Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) is projected to be completely up and running by 2023.

The government announced in 2020 that a total of S$87.5 billion had been set aside for new rail projects in the next decade, which will include even more lines and stations to boost the transport system even further.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/festivals-in-singapore/festivals-in-singapore,"TL;DR
Did you know that eight out of the eleven public holidays in Singapore are celebrations originating from our various religions and cultures1? Singapore today is known to be a colourful mix of cultures, faiths, and communities. Naturally, our festivals are a rich celebration of our multicultural heritage, as we get to indulge in the sights, sounds, and flavours from our diverse origins.
A migration of festivities
To truly understand how Singapore became such a melting pot of cultures, we have to go back two centuries to when the country was first established as a bustling trading hub of the region.
Singapore’s special position on the world map naturally put it in the middle of many trade routes. Vessels from all over the world stopped here to resupply or trade. Immigrants from China, India, and the Malay Archipelago, among others, flocked here to seek greater fortunes.
After long, treacherous journeys by sea, many of our forefathers built places of worship along the coast at Telok Ayer Street. Temples, mosques, churches, and shrines were established for the immigrants to give thanks to their gods2 for providing them safe passage, and to ask for blessings in the new chapter of their lives. Telok Ayer Street is today the street with the most number of national monuments in Singapore. With the freedom to practise their faiths freely, our immigrants also brought with them the festivals celebrated by the Muslims, Hindus, and the Chinese – festivals that have grown to become the vibrant spectacles of modern Singapore.
Let’s begin our festival journey with the first celebration of the year.
Pongal
Usually in: January, place of origin: India
A beautiful festival of offering thanks to nature, Pongal is traditionally a harvest festival originating from South India celebrated in the beginning of Thai, the tenth Tamil month. Cooked rice is traditionally offered to the deities to thank them for a bountiful harvest3.
The Pongal bazaar at Campbell Lane4 is where local Indians can find their favourite goodies and buy offerings such as the Indian sugar cane, ginger and turmeric plants, and devotional milk pots5.
The Pongal bazaar is a feast of the senses and perfect for immersing yourself in the festival atmosphere. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
Lunar New Year
Usually in: January or February, place of origin: China6
Squeezing through the crowds at the Chinatown night market7 in the month leading up to Lunar New Year is perhaps an experience every Singaporean Chinese gladly shares. Entire streets decorated in splashes of red and gold, massive light displays8, long queues outside popular bakwa (barbecued pork) stalls9, and street vendors loudly touting traditional goodies and introducing the latest flavours.10
Lunar New Year is the most anticipated festival among the local Chinese community. Celebrated on the first day of the Chinese Lunar Calendar, the entire fiesta lasts 15 days. On New Year’s Eve, every Chinese, no matter which corner of the world they might be in, would return home to their family for a reunion dinner.11 After the meal, many families would gather around the TV to watch the countdown performance broadcasted from Chinatown.12
The following morning, everyone puts on new clothes to welcome new beginnings, and visit their relatives to exchange blessings13, never once taking a break from the mouth-watering pineapple tarts, and other festival snacks. This goes on for two weeks, punctuated by steamboat dinners, yusheng ceremony (raw fish salad tossing)14, and even more gatherings with friends and relatives.15
The Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple is packed with devotees every Chinese New Year’s Eve offering their prayers. Many believe that the first person to offer their incense will receive bountiful blessings during that year. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
The River Hong Bao is a week-long extravaganza16 held every Chinese New Year along the Singapore River since 198717. This five-storey high Monkey God18 was the main attraction for the celebration of the Year of the Monkey. (c. 1992. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Since 197319, the Chingay Parade is an annual street festival participated by members of every ethnic community. The procession is a multi-sensory spectacle of floats representing different grassroots associations and communities. (c. 1970s–80s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Thaipusam
Usually in: January or February20, place of origin: India, religious roots: Hinduism
For Hindus, one of the most powerful ways of showing devotion to their deities takes place at the annual Thaipusam Festival. On the full-moon day in the month of Thai in the Tamil calendar, Hindus in Singapore commemorate the victory of Lord Subramaniam (also known as Lord Murugan) over the evil forces with a vel (spear), an element which has become the most recognisable part of the festival21. 
The most pious believers pierce their bodies and faces with hundreds of needles from their kavadi22, a structure of at least 20 kg23 in weight that they carry, and walk barefoot for 3 to 4 km24 as an offering to the deity. This arduous walk of faith stretches from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. Devotees are usually cheered on by close friends and families, who walk together with them while carrying palkudam (devotional milk pots)25.
Thousands of bystanders offer additional encouragement along the route, starting on Serangoon Road and finishing Tank Road, eager to be part of the devotees’ journey of devotion.
Only the most pious devotees carry the kavadi for this 4-km walk. Here is a shot from the procession along Selegie Road. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
The kavadi is carried primarily with a belt and pierced to the body using hooks, needles and spikes. (c. 1970–1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Kavadis are traditionally made of wood or steel, and adorned with peacock feathers, milk pots, flowers, and pictures of deities. (c. 20th century. Image from Asian Civilisations Museum)
Vesak Day
Usually in: May, place of origin: Nepal / Sri Lanka, religious roots: Buddhism
Buddhists from around the world honour Vesak Day as a commemoration to Buddha’s birth and enlightenment. Celebrated on the full-moon day of May27, Buddhists come together to remind their communities of Buddha’s teachings and to renew their resolutions of leading a life of morality, humility, and simplicity.28
Around Singapore, Buddhists visit temples and offer flowers, joss sticks, and prayers,29 while the more devout perform a “Three Steps, One Bow” ritual to express repentance. Monks also give talks about peace and happiness at temples, and how the 25-century-old teachings apply to the islander’s fast-paced urban life.31
Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery is well known for the “Three Steps, One Bow” ritual performed by its devotees on the eve of Vesak Day every year.
Hari Raya Puasa
Place of origin: Middle East, religious roots: Islam
Hari Raya Puasa, also known as Hari Raya Aidilfitri, is the celebration of the end of Ramadan, the islamic month of fasting and prayer. On the first day of Syawal, or the tenth month of the Islamic calendar, the Muslim community gathers to bond, feast, and to celebrate. As families come together32, the younger generation would take turns to kiss the hand of their elders as a sign of respect, while asking them for forgiveness.33 A beautiful practice common in Southeast Asia, families would put on the same colours when they go out visiting to show their unity.34
The Hari Raya Light-up at Geylang Serai is one of the biggest highlights of the festival, with miles of brightly lit stalls selling a wide variety of Malay culinary delights, gifts, and clothes at the Ramadan bazaar.
During Hari Raya Puasa, we get to indulge in the famous beef rendang (spicy beef stew), ketupat (rice cakes wrapped in coconut leaves), and lontong (rice cakes with coconut gravy). And of course, the celebration isn’t complete without the delicious kueh (sweets) and biscuits, which are must-haves for every family.35

Hari Raya Haji
Place of origin: Middle East, religious roots: Islam
A sacred festival of sacrifice and sharing, Hari Raya Haji marks the end of Haj37, or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Muslims across Singapore gather in mosques for prayers while the Korban ritual is performed. Lambs and sheep are sacrificed and the meat will be distributed to the poor and needy. This symbolic ritual honours Prophet Ibrahim’s devotion in offering his own flesh and blood as a sacrifice to Allah.38
An occasion of sharing and giving, devotees help to distribute meat to the needy on Hari Raya Haji at Sultan Mosque. (c. 2013. Image from ghettosingapore.com)
Mid-Autumn Festival
Usually in: September or October39, place of origin: China
Also called the Lantern Festival among the local Chinese community40, Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated on the full moon (fifteenth day) of the eighth month of the Chinese lunar calendar.41 Giant lantern displays are put up in Chinatown throughout the month to mark this special occasion.42 On this evening, children parade the streets with their own lanterns while adults come together to eat mooncakes and appreciate what they believe to be the roundest and brightest moon of the year.43
Every year, local bakeries and restaurants use this occasion to come up with creative twists to the traditional mooncake, infusing popular flavours such as durian, strawberry, and even truffles.44
Chinatown is also home to the annual Mid-Autumn Light-Up Ceremony. This is a shot from the finale performance in 2015. (c. 2015. Image from ghettosingapore.com)

Deepavali
Usually in: October or November, place of origin: India, religious roots: Hindusim
The Festival of Lights is one of the most important festivals for Hindus.45 This day is a celebration of the victory of Lord Krishna over King Narakasura, the triumph of good over evil, and light conquering darkness.46
Little India bursts into life with hundreds of metres of decorative lighting, bazaars, and celebratory activities, as devotees flock to the temples to offer their prayers.47 Follow the scent of floral garlands and incense as you browse through the colourful stalls filled with traditional snacks, embroidered sari (traditional Indian womenswear), and thousands of bangles.48
The Sri Mariamman Temple, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore49, also hosts a fiery spectacle a week leading up to Deepavali. Here, you can join thousands of devotees as they walk on burning charcoal as a tribute to the goddess Sri Drowpathai Amman.50

Christmas
Falls on: 25 December, place of origin: Rome, religious roots: Christianity
In December every year, malls along Orchard Road showcase their themed decorations and Christmas trees, turning the entire shopping street into a parade of lights.51 Our tropical Christmas is celebrated by most as an occasion to indulge in our favourite hobbies – eating and shopping. Christmas menus pop up in every restaurant and our retail outlets lure in shoppers with Christmas sales and promotions.52
For the Christians in Singapore, the season of sharing brings the community together in churches for prayers and midnight masses. Traditional Christmas meals take on a creative local twist, infused with our favourite spices such as ginger, chilli, and even curry.
When night falls, that’s when the real show on Orchard Road begins. Over the years, the Christmas decorations have gotten increasingly creative and magnificent. (c. mid 1980s. Image from National Museum of Singapore)

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/singapore-shophouses/story,"TL;DR
Before the era of colossal skyscrapers, mega retail complexes and dense, high rise HDB flats, Singapore’s built landscape was largely dominated by quaint shophouses. Based on the Chinese courtyard house style, with modifications to suit the tropics, shophouse properties were generally constructed between the 1840s and 1960s. Over time, six distinct architectural styles, beginning with Sir Stamford Raffles’ barebones rendition, emerged.

A defining look for the port city: Raffles’ prototype
Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore, had a pretty clear idea of how he wanted the port city to look from the get-go. On November 4 1822, he issued a set of ordinances defining the building type he preferred dominating the cityscape.
His building stipulations served as a template for the construction of squat, two-storey units anchored by a business on the ground floor with the residence of the proprietor sited above — what we refer to as the shophouse today.
Raffles dictated that these houses “have a verandah of a certain depth, open at all times as a continued and covered passage on each side of the street”.1 The resulting five-foot ways were intended to provide pedestrians relief from the tropical heat and protection from the rain and street traffic.2
The iconic five-foot way was introduced by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. (c.2014. Image from lionraw.com)
This was Raffles’ take on Chinese courtyard houses.3 Settlers from the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian had brought their blueprints to Singapore.4 Raffles’ version was later replicated in city centres across the region.5 In Singapore, shophouses started appearing in the city centre in the 1840s before spreading across to other neighbourhoods over the course of a century.6
Shophouses originally served merchants and their families. This changed as large waves of immigrants moved to Singapore. In need of accommodation, shophouses soon evolved into cramped, unhygienic shared dwellings.7
“Universal” features of a shophouse
The archetypal Singapore shophouse comes with five-foot ways and strong symmetry.8 It has a long and narrow floor plan, reflecting the Southern China practice of taxing buildings based on their widths.9 Shophouses typically have internal courtyards, open stairwells and skylights.10
Overtime, six distinct typologies of shophouses emerged.
Within these categories, sub-design styles also surfaced. Take for instance the Chionoshire. This style is characterised by the extensive use of Chinese decorative elements such as flowers, vases with peonies, birds, cranes, peacocks, dragons, phoenixes and zodiac characters.11
Then there is the Rococo style where almost every inch of the shophouse facade is covered with ornamentation in a layered, “wedding cake” style.12
Western design elements, such as Georgian style fanlights and classical mouldings in the Roman Doric style, entered the shophouse scene in the mid-1880s.13
Rudimentary and squat: the Early Shophouse style (1840s-1900s)
The first rendition of the shophouse was rudimentary in nature with minimal ornamentation and decorative elements. It had shutters for windows and a roof made out of locally produced clay tiles. It was a reflection of the times, when resources such as skilled labour and building materials were limited and basic at best.
Raffles’ shophouse “prototype” rose south of the river, between South Bridge and New Bridge Roads.14 South Bridge Road was one of Singapore’s main thoroughfares which connected the town to New Harbour, present-day Keppel Harbour.15 Wholesale and retail merchant traders, as well as godowns and goldsmith shops chose to locate their businesses here to capitalise on the traffic.
Singapore’s earliest shophouses were built along South Bridge Road. Major James Low of the Madras Army who visited Singapore during this period, wrote that he enjoyed browsing the items on sale along their “piazzas” (five-foot ways). (c. Early 20th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
Elegant simplicity: the First Transitional Shophouse style (early 1900s)
No longer a fledgling settlement, skilled labourers began pouring into Singapore. Among them were craftsmen who added decorative plasterwork and colourful tiles to the facades of shophouses, bringing a cheerier look to the city’s streets.16
Structurally speaking, the shophouses of this era tended to be taller than their predecessors. Their timber windows were also fitted with small panels of glass.
By the 1900s, a second typology of shophouses emerged. This time, the units were taller and more elegant compared to the rudimentary nature of their predecessors. (c.1920s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
An exuberant riot of colours: the Late Shophouse style (1900-1940)
The third wave of shophouses in Singapore, known for having three instead of two windows on their upper floors, added explosions of colour and head-turning eclecticism to the streets of Singapore. Artisans, drawing inspiration from across the globe, generously adorned facades with detailed plaster, tile and cast iron ornamentation work.
Many of these lavishly decorated shophouses were funded by people who had come into wealth during the rubber boom (1900-1930).17
The Late Shophouse style can be found along Emerald Hill where exuberant Peranakan tiles, decorative Corinthian columns and pilasters, full-length French windows,18 bat-motif vent openings, and carved swing-doors continue to delight residents, locals and tourists alike.19

Shedding ornamentation: the Second Transitional Shophouse style (late 1930s)
The shophouses that rose during this era were more subdued. Developers dialled back on embellishments and kept colours and tiles muted, focusing instead on simple, streamlined geometric forms.
This could have been a matter of personal taste with the rising influence of the international Art Deco movement, or a reflection of the economic circumstances of the time as a result of The Great Depression (August 1929–March 1933).
Clean lines please: the Art Deco Shophouse Style (1930-1960)
Geometric patterns, streamlined capitals, as well as clean arches and keystones anchor the Art Deco Shophouse Style.21
These shophouses are also known for their date plaques which capture the year of their completion.22
Art Deco shophouses can be found along 486-588 Serangoon Road. These have fair-faced brickwork and symmetrical corner facades.23
Back to basics: the Modern Shophouse Style (1950-1960)
Pragmatic design and utilitarian features are hallmarks of the Modern Shophouse style which produced more severe looking properties.
To improve ventilation across these spaces, builders added thin concrete fins and air vents, sticking closely to the disciplined geometric proportions of the style.

Roof-raising demand for shophouses
Attesting to their timeless quality, Singapore’s shophouses can net their owners millions in the resale market.
In 2022, for instance, five adjoining shophouses on Club Street, in the Telok Ayer conservation area, were placed on sale for $28.5 million.24
Against a limited supply, the value of these properties have been buoyed by investors eager for aesthetically pleasing and historically rooted places to pilot fresh business concepts. Among them are operators of trendy co-living spaces who have been snapping up shophouses across the city.
You, however, do not need deep pockets to enjoy these charming properties. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has conserved about 6,500 shophouses — a number of which are partially or fully accessible to the public.
For instance, a stroll through Chinatown will take you to a majestic, three-storey shophouse at the intersection of Keong Saik Road, Teck Lim Road and Jiak Chuan Road. The space is occupied by a modern F&B establishment.25
You can also go on a photowalk to capture the delightful pastel hues of Koon Seng Road’s shophouses, or plan a stay at a shophouse hotel in Little India or Kampong Glam.26 The ball, as they say, is in your court.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/traditional-trades/story,"While they may not look like it, many of the traditional trades in Singapore, from traditional Coffee powder grinders to Street barbers were early entrepreneurs who helped lay the foundation for the rise of modern craftsmen such as tailors with their bespoke suits, or baristas and their artisanal coffee.
Watch: A Traditional Coffee Powder Grinder
Mr Tan Boon Hong and his son, Mr Tan Peck Ho are some of the last traditional coffee powder grinders left in Singapore. Their shop, Lam Yeo Coffee Powder, has been around since 1959.

Watch: An Encounter with a Street Barber
Street barbers such as Lee Yong Tong, who has been in the trade for more than 50 years are now very much a rarity that cater to a small but loyal following.
Many of these traditional trades arose in the early days of Singapore’s history as a means of survival. Though some were undoubtedly influenced from skills and cultures adapted from their respective homelands, a majority were developed to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing population and changing society.
Traditional trades and the craftsmen that practice it were visible in all sectors of Singapore’s socio-economic landscape ranging from food and trade, to lifestyle and entertainment. Though many of these craftsmen and their trades have since vanished, their ability to adapt their skills and businesses to the changing landscape till this day is a testament to their continued ingenuity and perseverance.
The Craftsmen
Before the days of street art and computer graphic design, hand-painted movie posters were all the rage, especially during the era of Singapore’s Golden Age of Cinema. Hand-drawn movie poster painters like Ang Hao Sai, who first became an apprentice in a poster studio in 1963, were in great demand to help churn out promotional posters for films produced by the likes of Cathay Keris and Shaw Brothers’ Studio. Although Ang closed his studio in 1987, he has reinvented his business and has continued in his craft till today.
Mr Ang Hao Sai first became an apprentice at a poster studio in 1963 at a time of Singapore’s Golden Age in Cinema. His own studio had to close down in 1987 but he has since reinvented himself to meet the demands of a modern society.
On a more personal note, Letter writers such as Mr. Thangaraju, who first came to Singapore from South India in 1951, provided an affordable means of communication between immigrants and their families back home at a time when long-distance phone calls and formal education were a rarity. For him, his own experience as an immigrant undoubtedly helped to lend a sense of empathy to the letters he wrote. Letter writing slowly died out in the 1970s due to lack of clients and improving education in Singapore.
The story of Singapore’s infrastructure would not be complete without the contributions of Samsui women such as Ms Ng Moey Chye. Along with many others who hailed from the sanshui (Samsui in Cantonese) region in China, she would carry heavy loads of bricks and construction material to-and-fro work sites between Chinatown and Collyer Quay, while donning the iconic red headscarf that ensured their visibility at work sites while storing their personal belongings all at once.
On the domestic front, Urut ladies, or Malay midwifes, such as Madam Runtia Binte Murtono played an important role in helping new mothers through their first few months after delivering by conducting traditional post-natal rituals. This included urut, a traditional massage technique handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation.
Still holding strong
While many traditional trades and craftsmen have since retired or developed into other trades, a good few such as the Bumboat operators of Pulau Ubin, Traditional confectioneries and Second-hand book sellers continue to provide daily necessities and services to a small but grateful audience. Their contribution to Singapore’s rich cultural heritage and entrepreneurial spirit is an invaluable asset that contributes not just to the socio-economic makeup of our society, but the identity of Singapore as nation.
Watch: The Boat Operators of Pulau Ubin
For boat operators like Jie Gao Cai, life on the seas started way back when he was just 14 years old as a crew members on board one of the bumboats. He received his manning license at the age of 18 and has been a boat operator ever since.
Watch: A Traditional Teochew Confectionary
For family businesses like Gin Thye Cake Maker who have been around since 1964, the attention to ingredients, recipes and techniques help ensure that customers get only the freshest and most delicious confections.
Goldsmiths were a common sight along Buffalo Road during the 1960s. Many stores would create an array of traditional Indian jewellery worn by many Indian brides during their wedding day. Watch a goldsmith craft a 'M Thali' with Perumal Motif here.

Typically situated in lush, wooded environments, and occasionally overlooking valleys, the black and white bungalows of Singapore are a legacy of the island’s colonial past. Built between 1903 and 1941, these stately residences were typically occupied by the well-heeled. 
Singapore’s pool of black-and-white homes are now managed by the state. Some have been converted into restaurants and bars in areas such as Dempsey Hill, Rochester Park and Seletar Aerospace Park.
The rest are generally occupied by well-heeled Singaporeans and expatriates, as well as foreign embassies. (c2014. Image from ghettosingapore.com) 
The Bungalows of early Singapore
An 1823 sketch of the town of Singapore, by Lieutenant Philip Jackson, depicts single-storey timber buildings with long verandahs gracing the shoreline. 1 These were mostly Anglo-Indian bungalows — a style introduced by British settlers. 2
By the mid-19th century, local features were added to the design of the aforementioned bungalow style. For instance, the structure was raised above the ground — a feature likely inspired by indigineous Malay architecture, where homes are propped up on stilts to keep interiors cool and floods at bay. 3
Architectural historian Julian Davison branded the union of both styles as the “Anglo-Malay bungalow”. The style is also known for its lofty ceilings, tiled roofs, deep overhanging eaves, classical columns on plinths as well as broad verandahs. 4
Both the Anglo-Indian bungalow and the Anglo-Malay house serve as the foundation of the black and white house.5

#trending in 1903: the genesis of Singapore’s black and whites
According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the black and white bungalow is known for its overhanging hipped roof, use of half timber construction, open ground floor as well as verandahs on the second storey with a carriage porch below. 6 Its name is a nod to the house’s dark timber beams and whitewashed walls.
Meanwhile, the Singapore Land Authority, which manages the bulk of Singapore’s remaining black and whites, describes the style as the “cross-pollination of indigenous Malayan and mock-tudor features”. 7
How did the trend of black and white living take flight? 
This has been attributed to gifted architect, Regent Alfred John Bidwell (1869–1918) of Swan & Maclaren, who produced the pioneering design of the now defunct W. Patchitt House at Cluny Road in 1903. Davison describes the home as having had a half-timbered mock-Tudor upper storey constructed over a classically detailed masonry ground floor, as well as a soaring roof with two square towers at either end of its front elevation.  
Renowned in London and well-versed in a wide array of architectural trends, Bidwell was prolific in Singapore for designing iconic structures such as the fabled Raffles Hotel. His Cluny Road home set the stage for other black and whites.
Architect Regent Alfred John Bidwell didn’t just kickstart the black-and-white house trend, he also designed the world famous Raffles Hotel (above), Victoria Concert Hall and Singapore Cricket Club. (c1902. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Its evolution
Demand for black and white houses spiked among the well-heeled of Singapore as a result of Bidwell’s revolutionary design. Top-ranking government officials, barristers and brokers were among those who bought up large plots of land and commissioned architectural practices like Bidwell’s Swan & Maclaren to design their residences. 8
Over time, other influences, such as tropical Edwardian, trickled into the architectural lexicon of Singapore’s black and white houses.
The colony’s black and white chapter concluded abruptly as a result of World War II. The last of Singapore’s black and whites were of the military black and white style which can be found in areas like Alexandra, Changi, Seletar and Sembawang. 9
During the 1920s and 30s, black-and-white houses were built to accommodate military personnel working at the nearby Seletar Airbase. 10(c.2014. Image from lionraw.com)
  Located at 143 Queen’s Avenue, near the old Sembawang Naval Base, this property is one of the many black-and-white houses still standing in Singapore today. (c2014. Image from lionraw.com)

Telok Ayer, which once hugged Singapore’s old coastline, was envisioned as a Chinese district in Sir Stamford Raffles' 1822 town plan. The diverse community of immigrants that landed on its shores, however, had its own say. Over time, a clutch of religiously and culturally diverse institutions sprouted up to serve their needs.

(Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
A bay of hopes and dreams
News of the colony’s commercial vibrancy made ripples across Asia. Risking life and limb, immigrants, eager to leave behind impoverished circumstances, embarked on perilous journeys in overcrowded junks for a fresh start in Singapore. Many of the vessels they came on would have docked along Telok Ayer’s seafront.
Upon setting foot on shore, looking for accomodation and job matching assistance would have been a priority, however the religious among them would have likely made a first stop at the makeshift shrines along the waterfront to give thanks for safe passage.

Life was pretty rough for immigrants. Telok Ayer itself, which was generally occupied by the Chinese as per the design of the Raffles Town Plan of 1822, soon became overcrowded and a hub for the slave trade.2
The British made some adjustments to the site beginning in the late 1800s via reclamation works which pushed Telok Ayer Street four streets away from the seafront. Cecil Street, Robinson Road and Shenton Way were subsequently built on the reclaimed land.
Even more has changed since then, with the area now home to skyscrapers and modern buildings. Despite these sweeping changes, the imprint of Singapore’s early immigrants still exists in the form of six historic buildings: the Thian Hock Keng temple, Singapore Yu Huang Gong, Ying Fo Fui Kun, the Al-Abrar Mosque, Nagore Dargah and the Telok Ayer Methodist Church. The National Heritage Board gazetted these as national monuments between the years 1973 and 2009, and they remain as tangible representations of our forebears' fears, hopes and dreams.
Join us as we walk you through Telok Ayer’s multicultural, national gems.
Ying Fo Fui Kun, No. 98 Telok Ayer Street
Ying Fo Fui Kun, a clan association, strove to help new Hakka immigrants find accommodation and jobs in Singapore. Most Hakkas worked as woodcutters and carpenters as well as blacksmiths and goldsmiths.
Established in 1822, just three years after Stamford Raffles landed, this cosy, two-storey clan provided Hakka settlers with job matching services and temporary respite3 after the long journey at sea.
Its name reflects its founders’ desire for peaceful coexistence among the Hakkas of Singapore4 — the fourth largest Chinese dialect group. The late founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, as well as the Aw brothers of Tiger Balm fame, are among some of Singapore’s most well-known Hakkas.
The monument’s appearance resembles clan-temple buildings common in the southeastern coastal region of Guangdong, China. As you walk by, take note of the windows along its facade for they have been positioned pretty high off the ground to discourage intruders.
Nagore Dargah Indian-Muslim Heritage Centre, No. 140 Telok Ayer Street

Walk a little further down the street and you’ll be greeted by the peach and white limestone Nagore Dargah Indian-Muslim Heritage Centre — a replica of an Indian shrine in Tamil Nadu devoted to 13th century Muslim saint Shahul Hamid who was known for his ability to protect sailors and seafarers.
Seeking a new life, Chulia immigrants who worked primarily as traders and money changers, left their homes along the windswept Coromandel Coast in southern India for Singapore. Before embarking on the long voyage, they visited the saint’s shrine in the town of Nagore to pray for safe passage.
The Chulias built a version of this shrine in Telok Ayer between the years 1828 and 1830. The building boasts eclectic architecture. Think Doric columns and arches as well as large French style windows.5 Look closely and you will be able to spot niches in its towers — oil lamps used to be placed in these little lots during festivals. In 2011, it was relaunched as the Nagore Dargah Indian Muslim Heritage Centre.
Singapore Yu Huang Gong, No. 150 Telok Ayer Street
Just a few doors down stands the former Keng Teck Whay building — the only surviving Peranakan ancestral hall and clan complex in Singapore.6 It was closed to the outside world for almost 160 years.
Citing a common ancestry in Zhangzhou, in the Fujian Province of China,7 36 Peranakan merchants with surnames such as Ang, Chan and Yeo,8 got together to establish the private mutual aid organisation in 1831.
The building which served as a place to venerate their ancestors, worship the deity Sanguan Dadi,9 and conduct meetings, was completed in the late 1840s and early 1850s.10 Membership continues to be restricted to the male descendants of its founding members.11
The Keng Teck Whay brotherhood relocated to Changi in 2010 following the structure’s gazette as a national monument the year before.12 The Taoist Mission (Singapore) acquired it in 2010 and oversaw an elaborate $3.8 million restoration project. The building now bears a new name — the Singapore Yu Huang Gong and is dedicated to the worship of the Heavenly Jade Emperor. It is open to all. While there, keep a look out for delicately crafted sculptures and carvings of dragons, fish and flowers on its roofs.
Thian Hock Keng, No. 158 Telok Ayer Street

Constructed between 1839 and 1842, the temple is dedicated to Mazu, a deity widely regarded as the goddess of the sea. The temple, one of the oldest places of worship in Singapore, was designated a national monument in 1973. (Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
After a long journey by sea, weary travellers of yesteryear were said to have made their way through Thian Hock Keng’s incense-filled halls to offer thanks to Mazu, a goddess known for her ability to protect seafarers.
Likely the oldest Hokkien temple in the country, Thian Hock Keng at 158 Telok Ayer Street started life as a small shrine for Mazu. It was rebuilt between 1839 and 1842 with the donations of owners and sailors of Chinese junks at the harbour, as well as Hokkien merchants and community leaders.
Engravings of bats, in the corners of carved stone windows along the temple’s facade, represent luck and prosperity.
Inside, a wooden plaque inscribed with Chinese characters which mean “gentle waves over the South Seas” — a blessing for safe passage from Emperor Guangxu of Qing China — takes pride of place above the temple’s main altar.13
Once a year, Thian Hock Keng organises a rambunctious procession known as the Excursion of Peace where a sedan chair ferrying the image of Mazu is paraded through the historic streets of Telok Ayer before proceeding to board a ferry at Marina South Pier to bless the sea.
The temple was refreshed in a major restoration exercise between 1988 and 2000, earning it an honourable mention at the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2001.
Al-Abrar Mosque, No. 192 Telok Ayer Street
The Al-Abrar Mosque which faces Mecca, was established in 1827 as a thatched hut which explains its nickname — kuchu palli, or hut mosque in Tamil. Between 1850 and 1855, the hut was replaced by a brick building which still stands today albeit with some modifications.14 (c1950s. Image from the National Museum of Singapore)
Continue along the same five-foot way and you’ll spot the Al-Abrar Mosque, also known as Masjid Chulia. The mosque was established as early as 1827 as a place of worship for Chulias or Tamil Muslims from the Coromandel Coast of southern India. It took the form of a thatched hut.
The mosque’s Indo-Islamic design, with features such as minarets at its entrance, stands out from the rows of shophouses lining Telok Ayer. Inside, the mosque boasts European Neoclassical design elements such as Doric columns and French louvred windows.
The mosque stands as a reminder of the role Chulia immigrants played in shaping Singapore as some of the colony’s early traders and money changers.
Telok Ayer Methodist Church, No. 235 Telok Ayer Street
The exterior walls of Telok Ayer Methodist Church are rather thick, having been reinforced during World War II to protect hundreds seeking refuge from bullets and shrapnel. Venture inside and you might be directed to a regular looking female toilet. During the war, it served as a storeroom with a trap door for women and girls to hide from the Japanese.
At the end of the street stands the charmingly eclectic Telok Ayer Methodist Church building, originally founded in 1889 in a shophouse clinic owned by American Methodist missionary Dr Benjamin West.15 Dr West had a heart for the Chinese community and his parishioners included patients recovering from opium addiction.16
The church moved to its present day location in 1925. To reflect the make-up of its early congregation, a Chinese-style pavilion roof was installed.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2016
Singapore has inherited a rich published heritage thanks to its history, socio-political development and strategic location at the confluence of civilisations. It was once the publishing hub in the region and a body of printed works, manuscripts and records of every description have survived through the ages. Part of this fascinating legacy was showcased in an exhibition by the National Library of Singapore, From the Stacks: Highlights of the National Library – which took place from January 30 to August 28, 2016 at the National Library Gallery. The exhibition presented over 100 items drawn largely from the library's Rare Materials Collection: Publications, manuscripts, maps, documents and photographs from the 1701 to 1960. Here are some of the highlights.
Chrita Dahulu-kala, Namanya Sam Kok, Atau, Tiga Negri Ber-prang: Chan Kim Boon, Han Teow, 1892 to 1896. Singapore.
THE PRIVATE RAFFLES
Over the years, the Library has acquired a small collection of holograph letters by Stamford Raffles (1781 to 1826) and individuals related to him, which form an invaluable primary resource material for research on Singapore’s early history and its modern founder. While most of the letters in the collection contain information relating to Raffles’ public life and endeavours, two letters featured in the exhibition provided glimpses into his private life and character.
A letter to his cousin (with the same name) is the longest private and only autobiographical letter by Raffles. It contains a detailed account of his career progression as well as reminiscences of his humble early life. Due to family circumstances, Raffles withdrew from school when he was barely 14 and worked as a clerk with the East India Company. Despite the hardship, he persevered in self- study and mastered French and acquired knowledge in literature and science. On his learning and family poverty he recalled:
“This was, however, in stolen moments, either before the office hours in the morning, or after them in the evening; and I shall never forget the mortification I felt when the penury of my family once induced my mother to complain of my extravagance in burning a candle in my room. And yet I look back to those days of misery, difficulty, and application with some degree of pleasure. I feel that I did all I could, and I have nothing to reproach myself with.”
Letter from Raffles to Reverend Dr Thomas Raffles, At Sea October 14, 1819. | Collection of National Library, Singapore.
The letter to the same cousin by Raffles’ second wife Sophia (1786 to 1858) portrays a blissful scene the Raffles family enjoyed in Bencoolen (present-day Bengkulu), Sumatra, where Stamford Raffles was the Governor-General from 1817 to 1823.
“Our domestic scene is so blessed and happy, I scarcely know how to describe it – my dear husband’s health and spirit are so bright and light and his mind so relieved from anxiety and cheered by the consciousness of having performed his duty, thus the present scene is more than usually happy – my sweet children are expanding daily – my little Lily is so gentle and interesting, that I am sure you would love her and I am as certain that you would love her bolder brother, because he is a miniature picture of his father in form, in face, in manners and I hope hereafter to add in mind, I have been so blessed as a mother. I ought not to regret the expectation of an additional tie next month but I could have been satisfied with the treasures I now possess and in watching them have formed sufficient occupation.”

Unfortunately, such happy scenario was very short-lived as four of their five children did not survive past early childhood and died of illnesses in the next few years before Raffles and his family returned to England in 1824.
“MALAYANISED” LITERATURE
The Malay language has been the lingua franca of maritime Southeast Asia for centuries. Traders and travellers had to learn Malay in order to communicate with the local populations. For some early diasporic communities such as the Peranakans, they adopted the language and spoke a creolised form of Malay peppered with Hokkien words and phrases known as Baba Malay. It is thus natural to find that some early books published in Singapore were in Malay or about the Malay language. To help with learning of Malay, dictionaries and grammar books were produced. Attempts were even made to teach Malay through nursery rhymes, such as a compilation of English nursery rhymes translated into Malay and adapted to local culture. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Baba Malay translations of Chinese historical novels were very popular among the Peranakan community.
Some examples of 'Malaynised literature' were showcased in the exhibition.
“HAJI’S BOOK OF MALAYAN NURSERY RHYMES”
In this collection of popular nursery rhymes both the original English version and the Malay translations are featured. In the latter, some words were replaced with local terms to give a familiar Malayan setting, for example, “Jack and Jill” became “Bi dan Akit”. The book was intended to be used for learning Malay as it includes a glossary of Malay vocabulary for the benefit of readers not proficient in the language. The book features charming illustrations depicting idyllic Malayan lifestyles in the pre-World War Two era.
Haji's book of Malayan nursery rhymes, Arthur Wedderburn Hamilton. Singapore: Printers Ltd, 1939.
Hamilton (1887 to 1967) lived in Penang where he learnt Malay and became acquainted with the local way of life. He was an officer of the Federated Malay States Police, a linguist, botanist and an author of Malay text books.
“HANTEOW”
This serialised 30-volume novel is probably the earliest Baba Malay translation of the Chinese classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms. From 1880s to 1942, translations of Chinese historical novels in Baba Malay were highly popular among the upper middle class Peranakans in Java and the Straits Settlements. They were indeed bestsellers of the day with a print run of up to 2,000 for each publication in 1930s.
Among the numerous translators of such novels in Singapore, Chan Kim Boon (1851 to 1920) was the most illustrious. A native of Penang, Chan was educated in English but received private tutoring in Chinese. He pursued further studies at the Foochow Naval School (in present-day Fuzhou) and went on to teach mathematics in that institution. He came to Singapore in 1872 to work as an administrator at law firm Aitken & Rodyk. However, he was better known for his translations of three Chinese classics: Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sam Kok), The Water Margin (Song Kang) and Journey to the West (Kou Chey Tian).

RECIPES FROM THE MELTING POT
Singapore’s melting pot of cultures has produced a rich multi-ethnic culinary heritage with countless recipes passed down through the generations. Certain Singapore published cookbooks were once regarded as “cookery bibles” and presents a myriad of sumptuous Malayan dishes.
The book contains “tried and tested” recipes which the author compiled while living in Seremban, Malaya between 1915 and 1919. The recipes emphasise on economy due to the shortage of food and price hikes during World War I. It was written for expatriate wives who wished to cook for their households instead of relying on local cooks. When first published in 1920, it sold out in a few months.
Cover and an advertisement from The mem’s own cookery book | The mem’s own cookery book: 420 tried and economical recipes for Malaya, W. E. Kinsey. | Singapore : Kelly & Walsh, 1929, 3rd edition.
MY FAVOURITE RECIPES
The recipes were meant to create typical European or British fare using local ingredients. Tips on local weight measurements, food prices and names of ingredients in Malay are given. A small proportion of the recipes are on local dishes such as satai (satay), rundang (rendang), curries and gula malacca. Several dishes probably would have been rather exotic to the locals, such as sheep’s brain on toast, sheep’s head broth, and jugged sheep’s heart.
This is the first cookbook by a Singaporean author, Ellice Handy (1902 to 1989), a Eurasian educator. First published in 1952, it contains recipes from the various communities in Malaya and catered to a cosmopolitan audience – the book includes a chapter on “Asian Recipes that can be used in U.K., U.S.A., Australia and places where Malayan Curry Ingredients etc., are not available.”
My favourite recipes, Ellice Handy. | Singapore: MPH, 1960.
On creating the Malayan flavour, Mrs Handy offered the following tips:
“If we want a Malayan-style dish of Chinese Beehoon (Rice Noodles) or Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice) we use a paste of pounded fresh red chillies and blachan (shrimp paste) and onions, instead of or in addition to the garlic and onions.”
“To European stews we add cloves and cinnamon and to omelette we add plenty of sliced onions and chillies and just before serving a teaspoon of soy sauce. When we roast a chicken the addition of ground cinnamon, cloves and pepper, thick soy sauce and a little sugar makes it a Chinese style dish, while the addition of the “Satay Paste” gives it the very popular Malay Satay flavour.”
As a culinary classic and the longest selling local cookbook, 11 editions have been printed since 1952 with the most recent one released in 2012.
There were too many publications of note in the exhibition to be highlighted in this article. The exhibits covered a wide array of topics, from politics, history, sociology, language and religion to current affairs, nature, travel, food and more. Some of the more novel items on display included an address to Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh by the Singapore Chinese merchants on the occasion of his visit in 1869; a 1901 photo album by G.R. Lambert with images of old Singapore and what is probably the first travel guidebook of Singapore, published in 1892. Visitors also saw for the first time English-Malay dictionary (1701); early nineteenth century Christian literature published by the Mission Press, the first printing press in Singapore; one of the earliest Qur’ans printed in Singapore (1869); and photographs of the war crime trials held at the Supreme Court in 1946.

MuseSG Volume 9 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2016
Technology advancement has brought about an increased popularity of emails and e-cards in place of traditional greeting cards. In today’s society, Chinese New Year greeting cards are on the verge of extinction, with only seniors and some organisations keeping the practice alive. Sending Chinese New Year greeting cards is now often perceived as an old-fashioned afterthought.
Yet, an interesting trivia is that sending Chinese New Year greeting cards was the “in” thing in Singapore in the sixties. Posting Chinese New Year greeting cards was once a popular practice, regardless of one’s economic and educational background, gender or social status. The popularity of Chinese New Year greeting cards then, along with its wide audience and variety, reflects a great deal about the rich cultural history of Singapore in the sixties.
In an era without mobile phones, postal delivery was the most common channel of communication. Sending Chinese New Year greeting cards through the mail was one of the ways of showing 礼 (courtesy) to one’s friends. Greeting cards from that period contained beautiful poetry that conveyed well wishes for the receiver, regardless of the cards physical sizes. The usage of words such as 我们 (we) indicated a form of togetherness, mutual support and companionship in welcoming a brand new year.
Poetry featuring strong sense of companionship
There used to be spaces provided in greeting cards that allowed senders to insert their own photographs, adding a personal touch to the cards that demonstrated a deeper level of sincerity.
Photo added to give card a personal touch
More significantly, the Mandarin characters 鞠躬 (bow) were printed in all the cards, referring to the sender taking a bow to symbolise politeness and respect for the recipient.
The sending of these greeting cards was once a show of the senders’ appreciation for the relationship with their recepients. During the sixties, Chinese New Year greeting cards were cheap and affordable, at about 10 cents each. Notably, the usage of typewriters or the engagement of printing service providers was common, to insert names directly and more efficiently on card printouts – this signified the large numbers of New Year cards that were sent out by individuals then.
Card with name typed in
These practices suggested that there were numerous greeting cards sent by the more affluent, or those wishing to maintain a wide relationship network, which contributed to the growth of the popular practice. Through mutual exchanges of greeting cards, friendships and business relations were renewed annually. The sixties in Singapore may have been a period of rapid change with industrialisation, development of modern housing and the decline of villages, but cultural ties were maintained and we were socially tightly-knit.
The young adults of the sixties were often educated in the fifties, a period in which the percentage of students in English and Chinese streams were relatively similar: 47.4 percent in the English stream and 45.9 percent in the Chinese stream. Chinese New Year greeting cards were used by both the English- and Chinese-educated population in Singapore then, with the two different social groups sharing a common practice. While different cultures took root among local populace in the sixties, Chinese New Year greeting cards began to include English translations of Chinese poetry, indicating their common audience of Chinese and English readers.
Card containing English and Chinese version of a poem
Additionally, students who were educated in English streams were also trained in a second language through Language Exposure Time (LET) and the 1966 compulsory second language act. This meant that those who went into the English stream were still in touch with Chinese cultural practices that were already strong amongst the Chinese population. Notably, the romanisation of Chinese names spelt with Hanyu Pinyin reflected how the English-educated Chinese were sending Chinese New Year greeting cards and thus connected with Chinese culture. Common assumptions of a cultural division between the English and the Chinese-educated populace then are thus not entirely true.
Unlike present-day Chinese New Year cards, which only emphasise traditional Chinese culture, Chinese New Year greeting cards back then were a blend of traditional Chinese culture and modernity. Rich traditional Chinese culture were present in three aspects:
- Firstly, the Chinese characters in most greeting cards were in traditional Chinese, with either a right to left text vector or a writing style that starts from top to bottom, echoing traditional Chinese writing styles.
- Secondly, card pictorials included flowers, butterflies and animals such as peacocks, commonplace symbols of prosperity and longevity in traditional Chinese culture.
- Thirdly, the colours utilised in these greeting cards were warm colours such as yellow or pink, symbolising peace in traditional Chinese culture.
Traditional Chinese colours and symbols
Yet these rich traditional Chinese components were placed alongside modern elements. Chinese New Year greeting cards in the sixties often included pictures of famous Hong Kong pop stars and Mandarin pop song lyrics. The incorporation of these stars and their songs into greeting cards and their desirability as gifts indicated the popularity of these Hong Kong stars among the local population in Singapore. Modern ways of dressing, in terms of hairstyles and fashion, thus enter the society through the emulation of these popular stars.
Card featuring Hong Kong star in the 60s
Young Singaporeans of the sixties began adopting Western clothing and embracing a modern identity. This phenomenon is represented by the women in image 8, who wore Western dresses instead of traditional cheongsams. This embracement of modernity was largely influenced by the historical context of Singapore in the sixties. The export-oriented economy inevitably exposed Singapore to cultural influences from other emerging economies such as Hong Kong. Furthermore, the need for a strong workforce invited men and women to step into the working world. This empowered women to have higher purchasing power, affording them choices in asserting their modern identities through the consumption of popular music and Western clothing.
The blending of traditional and modern elements in Chinese New Year greeting cards of the sixties reflected how tradition and modernity were not at odds and often co-existed. When examined closely, Chinese New Year greeting cards that were popular in the sixties reflected the social and cultural aspects of the times that may not be known to many.
These cards reveal a dynamic society that was united in a common culture of social exchanges. Singaporeans did not compromise traditions in their acceptance of modernity; despite differences at many levels, we were undivided in maintaining a culture that embraced a modern identity alongside the remembrance of tradition.

""Gelang si paku Gelang,
Geylang si rama-rama.
Mari pulang, marilah pulang
Marilah pulang,
Bersama-sama.""
Verse from Gelang Sipaku Gelang
The verse above is from the beloved local folk song “Gelang Sipaku Gelang” and while its lyrics are not entirely definitive, the song is often associated with the Malay community’s strong sense of belonging to Geylang Serai. The reason for this can be traced back to the 1890s, when the British forced the Malays and Orang Laut (Malay for “Sea People”) to move further inland from their original settlement at the mouth of the Singapore River.

They settled at the area now known as Geylang Serai, forming one of the oldest Malay settlements in Singapore. The area’s name hints of its past as a lemongrass plantation with geylang possibly deriving from the Malay word kilang, which means a factory or press-mill, and serai referring to lemongrass. Much of the area was reclaimed from swamplands to build the foundations for the Geylang Serai we recognize today.

While Geylang Serai was largely known as a Malay enclave earlier, the increasing population of the small island nation and the departure of the British blurred physical boundaries and created more porous communities. People of different religions and cultures learnt to live in harmony with each other.

Lee Hong Ping was born and bred within this united climate. His fondest memories are of the Lorong 40 Geylang playground next to the Geylang River, where he and family members would play at for over a decade, sharing walks around it and attending the many community events nearby, such as cultural performances and carnivals.

Lee gained a deeper understanding of the rich history and culture of the over 120 clans, associations and organisations in Geylang Serai when he became a member of the Geylang Serai Inter-Racial Religious Confidence Circle (IRCC). Hoping to share the heritage of the area with a wider audience, Lee championed a multi-year project to develop the Geylang Serai Foot and Food Heritage Trails.
Organised by the Integration and Naturalisation Champions (INC) Committee and supported by the National Heritage Board, these heritage trails showcase what Lee described as “the variety and diversity of Geylang Serai [that truly mirror] the multi-racial, multi-cultural Singapore”. Every trail site was selected carefully, taking into account a myriad of factors. At the core of each chosen site was the strength of its story – its history, founding values, objectives and the organisation’s faithfulness to its mission. The architectural conditions at these sites were also considered for driving the trail experience.

The work on the trails culminated in the creation of a guide map, allowing one to have an insider’s perspective of Geylang Serai. Marked with over 20 sites, the trails weave through numerous lorongs (Malay for road) and give a glimpse into the lives of its residents. Important places of worship and architectural remnants from a bygone era are brought to light on the guide map. A trail-walker will see rows of iconic shophouses line lorongs on either side, their ceramic tiles and colourful façades adorning the shops. Walking towards the entrance of the former Queen’s theatre, one can almost picture mid-nineteenth century residents hurrying in the light of ornate street lamps as they flocked to the foyer of the once-bustling cinema.

Places of worship are situated throughout the trail. Soon Thian Keing, the oldest Chinese Temple in Singapore, was established during the Qing dynasty and stands just metres away from the prayer halls of the Khadijah Mosque.

This is testament to the peaceful relationship between the diverse religious groups. Another reflection of the community spirit and understanding was the reaction to a fire in February 2011: It broke out at Chong Hood Lim Association, a Buddhist temple, and had badly affected the neighbouring Coronation Baptist Church. Upon learning that the church was unable to conduct service sessions, the temple association offered to let the church conduct temporary services at one of their newly-acquired activity centres.
No less important are the beloved food haunts on the trail, where one can spot locals gathering and sharing culturally-diverse meals. From enjoying a durian feast with friends and family at the “ five-foot way” along the stalls, to savouring soft and fluffy putu piring (Malay sweet snack) at the renowned Haig Road Centre – the simple pleasures in life remain unchanged from the past.
Since its launch in April, the Geylang Serai Foot and Food Heritage Trails have revealed to many the fascinating and unique story of a former kampong. Amidst the rapid development of our urban landscape, Lee hopes that others can also experience Geylang Serai “[in] its current charm and characteristics [and] see very diverse clans, groups and religious organisations like churches, temples and mosques remaining true to their roots, retaining their rich cultures and heritage, while continuing to co-exist harmoniously as good neighbours next to one another”.

Eager to share other facets of his community, Lee already has plans for the launch of more heritage trails in the future. His and the efforts of Geylang Serai INC are inspiring, and a reminder that everyone has a unique story to tell in the weaving of our Singapore Story.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Jyoti-Ramesh-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"A permanent exhibition at the Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) is titled “Indians In Singapore — Past and Present”. Talking about it to groups of visitors to the IHC may be daunting at times. But, 49-year-old Jyoti Ramesh sees it as part of learning about, living and transmitting history. All of these have been happening for her as a docent at IHC for the past 4 years.
Learning on the job
As Jyoti went through the months of rigorous training with Friends of the Museums (FOM), she understood the docent’s ideals of being “engaging and informative”. Jyoti is quick to add that she is by no means a repository of all IHC information either.
There are times when a challenging question is thrown at her like a curveball. She remembers a visitor asking why David Marshall was not featured at the IHC. Jyoti’s response was first to ask the lady what prompted the question and secondly to do extensive research and reading in her own free time. She found that, indeed, David Marshall did have some family connections in India. They were Baghdadi Jews from Iraq. If the question crops up again, Jyoti will be better prepared to talk about it. For docents, the learning journey never ceases.
As a docent, Jyoti feels connected to Singapore — both the new and the old. She says that when you join a heritage institution like the IHC, “you will then understand the struggles of migrant communities.” This, she feels, is vital for those who arrive on Singapore’s shores as expatriates and who are initially not connected with the community. Volunteering as a docent can help turn that situation around. “I don’t stop learning. I don’t stop making the connections… I look at it (history) with different eyes,” says Jyoti.
Constantly connecting
Jyoti feels she had an advantage in adjusting to Singapore when she first came here. She speaks Tamil. So, as a docent, when Tamils share their stories of Singapore with her, she is able to encourage them to elaborate. These conversations become part of her own learning journey.
She walks the talk, sometimes literally. Jyoti has been known to go to Abdul Rahim’s shop on Upper Dickson Road to tell him that a photograph displayed at the IHC looked like that of his shop from days of old. She persuaded the two brothers to visit IHC. Such neighbourhood connections matter as they inspire storytelling about how early migrants arrived by ship in Singapore on board the S.S Rajula, the State of Madras or the MV Chidambaram.
The conversations with visitors to the IHC and on the Indian Heritage trail are what drive Jyoti to keep learning about the artefacts as she connects the past, present, and future for Singaporeans and tourists alike.
“It starts with the history back some 2,000 years ago, but it continues to how migrants brought with them their culture, and why they came and what it has done to Singapore as we see it today,” says Jyoti. And, as classes of school children visit the IHC week after week, Jyoti feels she is helping the modern-day Indian Singaporean child to connect and think about their heritage here.
A love for sharing history
Jyoti was from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, and has a basic degree in Economics and an MBA (Finance) as well. She has worked not only in New Delhi but also in London and Hong Kong before moving to Singapore in 2007. As she is winding down her own business, she is immersing herself far more in the world of a docent. For her, it has been a natural progression as her two children have become older.
Jyoti says, “I love sharing connections. I love connecting the past with the present, and across countries in the past. I love connecting kids to their past, and telling them how relevant it still is.” It should come as no surprise that this docent’s mother was also her History and Civics teacher in school. She laughs and admits that she did not love history at that time as it meant mugging, exams, and homework. But, because her father was a Railway Officer, her family lived in some of the most historical cities in various parts of India. You might start to wonder whether a love for sharing history has somehow seeped into her DNA.

Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2012
MONUMENTAL WEDDINGS presented a collection of about 150 archival and contemporary wedding photographs taken at 32 of Singapore’s national monuments from the early 20th century to the present. These fascinating and unique images capture more than just couples on their wedding day and their love stories - they also feature historic buildings which have earned a permanent position in the landscape of Singapore as preserved monuments. Taken at these monuments, the photographs have become artefacts that reveal not only changes in wedding fashions, venues and photography, but also certain sociological and cultural trends and developments.
Broadly organised into five main segments, the exhibition highlighted the characteristics of Early Wedding Photography in Singapore and the popularity of monuments as wedding venues; the origins and evolution of Mass Weddings on the island; the Ties that Bind monuments, communities and families together; and the distinct architectural features of the national monuments that serve as Monumental Backdrops for wedding photos. Monumental Love Stories, four short films shot on location at the monuments, rounded off the exhibition by giving visitors the opportunity to see heart-warming couples on-screen as they relate stories of their deep-felt commitment and love, while a fifth film provided an industry-insider’s take on the history and development of wedding photography in Singapore.
The Early Beginnings of Wedding Photography in Singapore
Wedding Photography – Studio and Wedding Day
Wedding photography in Singapore before the second half of the 20th century consisted mostly of formal, posed indoor studio shots of the bride and bridegroom.
Actual day wedding pictures taken at the venue of the solemnisation or wedding reception were less common. Posed or candid, this was an option primarily for the privileged or prominent members of society who had the means to commission a photographer for the event itself.
A wide variety of locations could serve as the venue for a couple’s solemnisation ceremony or wedding reception, even in the early days. All couples featured in this exhibition, however, shared one thing in common: their weddings and/or wedding receptions were held at buildings, institutions and places that have now been recognised as historical treasures and gazetted as national monuments.
Monuments as Wedding Witnesses: Places of Worship
In early Singapore, religious places of worship took on an important role as sites of social interaction and fellowship for newcomers to the island.
Religious buildings also served another important function. They were venues of choice to mark one of the most significant moments of their members’ lives: their weddings. Families, together with the immediate community, would gather in these buildings to witness wedding customs and rituals being carried out and to give their blessings to the newly wedded couples.
Fashionable Affairs: Hotels and Commercial Venues
From notices and announcements published in local newspapers, it could be gathered that the custom of holding one’s wedding reception at hotels such as Raffles Hotel and Goodwood Park Hotel started in Singapore in the early 1900s, and was especially popular amongst the expatriate community.

Notable personalities such as former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and his wife, Madam Kwa Geok Choo, held their wedding reception at the Raffles Hotel.
Another popular venue was the Former Victoria Theatre and Memorial Hall (today’s Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall), which played host to wedding receptions of various ethnicities from the late 1930s to the late 1940s.
Institutions of Learning (and Weddings!)
In the early 20th century, the Peranakan Chinese community in Singapore publicly engaged in a discussion on the need to reform expensive and heavily ritualised Chinese wedding ceremonies. The view that traditional Chinese weddings were old-fashioned, and ‘modern’ forward-thinking Chinese should cast them off in favour of simplified ‘reformed’ weddings, was taken up by certain prominent members of the Chinese society.
Towards the 1920s and 1930s, such ‘reformed’ weddings were increasingly held at institutions of education and learning such as schools and libraries.
The concept of ‘modern’ education had taken root in Singapore and Mandarin began to replace Chinese dialects as the main medium of instruction in the 1900s. By 1939, there were 30,000 students enrolled in Chinese-language schools on the island. A popular motto during the 1920s and 1930s was: “Without Chinese education there can be no overseas Chinese”. It was thus no coincidence that the same period saw numerous Chinese couples choosing to take photos in front of institutions of Chinese learning. It was their way of expressing their Chinese identity and aligning themselves with the values that modern schools such as Tao Nan exemplified. Tao Nan stood out as one of the first ‘new style’ Chinese primary schools. Opened in the early 1900s, it promoted Chinese culture and values, which differed from 19th-century privately funded schools that had no fixed curriculum.

Mass Weddings at Monuments
The Move towards Mass Marriages
“Mass marriages are very wise in cases where the parties are not very wealthy... They are economical and convenient and it means young couples being able to begin their married life without making heavy expenditure. Mass marriages are customary in China but these are the first to be held in Singapore.”
– Kao Ling Pai (Singapore Chinese Consul-General), “Ten Couples Wed at Great World”, The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884 - 1942), 1 February 1937.
The first mass wedding ever held in Singapore took place at the Great World Amusement Park in 1937. The phenomenon of mass weddings in Singapore had its intellectual and ideological roots in Chiang Kai-Shek’s New Life Movement, which was launched to halt the perceived material and spiritual ‘degeneration’ of the Chinese people. The reform movement emphasised (among other things) simplicity and frugality; traditional Chinese weddings, regarded as costly and extravagant, became a target of this reform.
Marrying En Masse: “Affordable Pomp and Ceremony” (1940s - 1960s)
The outbreak of World War Two and the ensuing Japanese Occupation put a temporary halt to mass weddings in Singapore. The practice restarted with much fanfare in the late 1940s as organisations such as the Mayfair Musical and Dramatic Association, the Chinese YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association) and Chinese clan associations including the Khek Community Guild and the Hokkien Huay Kuan took the lead in initiating and promoting mass weddings. Although such ceremonies were no longer associated with the New Life Movement, mass weddings nevertheless prevailed because the essence remained unchanged: it saved money.

Dramatically Different Demographics
Besides reasons of economy, mass weddings took off in the two decades after the war also because of the dramatic demographic changes on the island during that period. A distinctive feature of 19th-century Singapore was the huge disparity in its number of men and women, especially among the immigrant Chinese and Indian populations. By 1947, however, the imbalance in the Chinese community was much reduced with a ratio of 1,132 men to 1,000 women. With the numbers of Chinese men and women almost at par, opportunities to find a marital partner were much increased.
Between 1956 and 1960, the Hokkien Huay Kuan alone held a total of 17 mass weddings. The first involvement of the clan association in its members’ weddings began with Tan Kim Ching, who took the lead to officiate weddings of Chinese couples during his tenure as president of the Hokkien Huay Kuan in the mid-19th century.
In 1969, Radio and Television Singapura organised a mass wedding ceremony at the Singapore Conference Hall as a publicity event for distribution and broadcasting overseas. It was the first of its kind and a precursor to the way mass weddings were marketed in the following two decades.
The first televised mass wedding in Singapore held at the Former Singapore Conference Hall and Trade Union House (Singapore Conference Hall today), 1969.

Marketing the Mass Wedding (1970s - 1980s)
“Imagine a wedding with more than a thousand guests, followed by a dream holiday abroad – for which you pay a mere $3,000.” – “I do... and so do we”, The Straits Times, 3 April 1988.
The trend of mass weddings in Singapore continued in the 1970s and 1980s, although the driving force behind such events were by then tour operators and travel agencies such as Singapore Cultural and Entertainment Tours, Oxley Tours and Sino-America Tours. These operators often co-opted other relevant parties including the Social Development Section (SDS) and Singapore Airlines.
Mass weddings were packaged with honeymoon trips to attract a new set of consumers. Held at the Neptune Theatre Restaurant, Shangri-La Hotel and even the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, these mass weddings were marketed as romantic and convenient alternatives, with the added advantage of a honeymoon abroad at affordable prices.

Mass Weddings
Revived (2000s)
By the 1990s, mass weddings had largely disappeared from Singapore as a result of a vastly different socio-economic environment. Personalised, customised and individualistic weddings became the norm. Nevertheless, in recent years, mass weddings have seen a surprising revival in Singapore. Mostly held on unusual or ‘auspicious’ dates, these mass weddings are now unique rarities organised for a variety of reasons. For example, the 2008 mass wedding organised by the Hokkien Huay Kuan was an effort to highlight the history and involvement of the clan association in the practice of mass weddings in Singapore. In the same year, the Sultan Mosque Malay mass wedding was held to foster closer links between families and the com- munity. In addition, the Botanic Gardens held a mass wedding for 150 couples on the ‘special’ date of 20 September 2009 (or 20.09.2009) to celebrate its 150th anniversary, while the People’s Association Family Life Section, in collaboration with Lianhe Zaobao and Sentosa Leisure Group, organised a mass wedding on 10 October 2010 (or 10.10.2010) to encourage more Singaporean couples to wed.
The Ties that Bind
Religious monuments in Singapore have been featured as backdrops in wedding photographs ever since wedding photography emerged from indoor studios to the outdoors. Many of these religious monuments were established in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the diverse ethnic backgrounds of migrants resulted in the construction of churches, temples, mosques, synagogues and other religious buildings. Besides serving as places of worship, these buildings also supported networks and welfare organisations that sheltered migrants, provided financial aid and helped to improve the lives of their communities. Naturally, these prayer halls and sanctuaries have over the years witnessed countless wedding solemnisations and played host to numerous wedding receptions, thus securing the religious monuments’ place in their worshippers’ treasured wedding albums.

A Part of the Family – Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple
For Chandra, the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple has a towering presence in his family history and childhood. His grandfather, P. Govindasamy Pillay, who established the PGP stores which sold sundries, spices and textiles, was the founder-member of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Pillay contributed generously to the temple, especially to the building of the five-tiered gopuram or entrance tower completed in 1979. Realising that the Hindu community needed a communal space for wedding ceremonies and celebrations, Pillay also funded the building of the wedding hall, where Chandra’s family and members of the Indian community have since held their weddings.
As a child, the temple served as a playground to Chandra and his siblings. He fondly remembers his mother taking them around the temple, sharing its stories and its various sculptures, paintings and decorative features.
Chandra now resides in the United Kingdom with his wife, Gail. When the couple decided to get married, they chose to return to Singapore to hold a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple. The temple remains a focal point for Chandra’s family as they continue to actively worship and participate in the various festivals and activities held at the temple.
“Now that I’m living in the UK, it’s really important to reconnect with the community in general when I come for my very short visits and the temple facilitates that. We come here in the evening and we’re pretty sure that some of my relatives, friends are going to be here after work for prayers as well.”

Since it was first built in 1855 as a simple brick building with a main hall, the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple has been an important religious centre for the Indian community in Serangoon – an area with a large concentration of Indian-run brick kilns and cattle farms in the 19th century that attracted numerous Indian migrant workers.
Gazetted as a national monument in 1978, the temple remains a focal point for the celebration of key Hindu festivals such as Brahmotsavan, Deepavali and Thaipusam.
Four Weddings and a Monument - Maghain Aboth Synagogue
Justin and Joelle were married on 20 March 2011 at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue. The synagogue has been an important witness to the weddings of four generations in Joelle’s family. Her great-grandmother, grandmother and mother all exchanged their vows under the cloth canopy in the synagogue. This canopy or covering, known as the chuppah, is a symbol of the home the couple will build together. Many couples from the tight-knit Jewish community were also married under it. Joelle’s family continues to worship at this synagogue and Joelle’s father, Victor Sassoon, is President of the Jewish Welfare Board. Their family actively contributes to this monument and the Jewish community.
“The Maghain Aboth Synagogue is a place for communal activities and prayer for our Jewish community. It is the longest standing structure in our community, and the first place that brings the community together on a regular basis. The synagogue gives our community a sense of belonging and permanence and we hope that this will continue to be clearly communicated for future generations.”
– Joelle
The Maghain Aboth Synagogue, the oldest synagogue in Southeast Asia, was established in 1878 to serve a growing Jewish population in Singapore.

Today, the synagogue continues to play an important role in the communal life of the local Jewish community, who gather at the synagogue to celebrate weddings and participate in religious festivals such as Yom Kippur and Simchat Torah.
A Call to Prayer and Love - Sultan Mosque
Shah and Syahidah’s paths were destined to cross. They were both regular worshippers at the Sultan Mosque when they met at the Raffles Hotel where they worked.
Shah attended Friday prayers at the mosque where his mother was also a regular worshipper.
Syahidah went for prayers at the mosque, which has been an integral part of her life since she was a child. Her grand-mother, who came to Singapore from Indonesia, settled in Kampong Glam where she first began attending the mosque. It was to the mosque that her grandmother fled when the Maria Hertogh riots erupted. Two generations on, Syahidah’s family continues to worship at the mosque.

Today, the couple continues to frequent the mosque which remains the centre of their spiritual life, and they hope to bring their newborn daughter there as well.
Sultan Mosque took its name from Sultan Hussein (appointed by Sir Stamford Raffles as the Sultan of Singapore), who requested that a mosque be built near his Istana in Kampong Glam. The original mosque was a single-storey brick building with a double-tiered roof completed in 1826. The current mosque, designed by Swan and MacLaren, was completed in 1928 with its distinctive golden domes. Sultan Mosque continues to be an important centre of religious, cultural and social activities for Muslims.

Monumental Backdrops
Rising sentiments have surged in recent years towards Singapore’s past. A wave of nostalgia has swept the nation, perhaps triggered by the pace of urban renewal. Singapore’s zest for modernisation and development led to a period of intense urban renewal, starting from the 1960s. As more and more buildings fell to the wrecking ball, familiar landscapes began to vanish, igniting public discussions on the emotional ties and social memories that places and buildings evoke as markers of identity and history; and consequently, the need for preservation and conservation.
With heritage at the forefront of public consciousness, ‘vintage’ has become fashionable and trendy. As buildings of great historical, architectural, social and cultural significance, Singapore’s national monuments have seen a surge in popularity among couples caught up in this wave of nostalgia and in search of something unique and special for their wedding albums. Mostly designed and constructed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, these monuments often feature beautiful architectural elements such as sweeping staircases, intricate carvings and sculptures, towering classic columns, steeples and minarets, and majestic domes. Their distinctive façades and use of geometric shapes and sharp clean lines serve as beautiful and unique backdrops against which wedding couples are framed, injecting a sense of elegance and grandeur into their photos. Furthermore, as historic buildings that have withstood the test of time, these monuments convey a feeling of timelessness, lending gravitas to the wedding pictures and highlighting what couples aspire for their marriages.
These wedding photographs showcase archetypal wedding pictures taken at popular national monuments with interesting stories of the monuments as well as the couples’ journey into marriage. They were contributed by couples who shared their stories and by photographers who shared their work.
Raffles Hotel
Did you know?
The main building of the Raffles Hotel was designed by Regent Alfred John Bidwell, a graduate of London’s Architectural Association and a member of architectural firm, Swan and MacLaren. It was opened with great fanfare on 18 November 1899 and introduced innovations such as electrical lights and fans. Its magnificent façade of louvre, fanlight-arched windows facing the seafront greeted visitors en route to other destinations as well as globetrotters on around-the-world cruises made popular by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.
St Joseph’s Church
Before they were an item, Jordan invited Candice to attend mass with him in St Joseph’s Church. Candice immediately felt a special connection to the church and was eventually baptised into the Catholic faith. They are one of the few rare couples who married at the church as it ceased to be a parish with an active congregation in 1999. St Joseph’s Church continues to be a focal point in the couple’s lives as they and their families still faithfully serve and worship there.

In a land where the mystical and natural meet, nothing seems extraordinary. Masks take on supernatural powers and lizards grow big enough to swallow a goat without much effort. This is Indonesia or “Islands of the Indies”, a vast archipelago located at the crossroads of the traditional spice route between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
Land of Dance and Dragon was a discovery of Indonesia through its dances. This exhibition at the Singapore Philatelic Museum explored one of the greatest demonstrations of skill, art devotion and culture – the living tradition of dance. To portray characters and animals, performers don masks and elaborate costumes to narrate anecdotes of history, epic tales as well as current affairs. What started as a ritual performed for the gods to ask for protection against calamity still survives today. The dances, masks and costumes are diverse and varied but the quest for a peaceful life is common throughout the length of the archipelago.

“Islands of the Indies”
With a total land area of 1,919,317 square kilometres, Indonesia spans the equator between continental Asia and Australia and consists of over 13,000 islands, of which only 6,000 are inhabited. There are five main islands – Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya – and two smaller archipelagos: Nusa Tenggara and the Maluku Islands.

The country has over 240 million people speaking many regional languages and dialects and practising many of the world’s major religions. Trade thrived in this region as early as the seventh century. During the rule of the Srivijayan (CE 700 – 1300) and later Majapahit (CE 1293 – 1500) empires, Indonesia traded with China and India. Through the same channels, Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced. Around 13th century, Islam arrived with Arab traders. European countries fought among themselves for control of the spice islands of Maluku. Dutch colonial powers (CE 1602 – 1942) then ruled Indonesia for three and a half centuries till after World War II.
Indonesia displays an amazing array of cultural forms. It has been said that in Indonesia – art and life are intertwined. To observe the formal study of dance is to understand the history and culture of the country: its music, religion, literature, sculpture and architecture. Indonesian culture is a rich blend of heritage, living tradition and modern art. Monuments provide the built heritage. Traditional theatres of shadow puppets or human actors form the living tradition, and contemporary painting, sculpture, drama and dance inject modernism.
Dance – A Living Tradition
Dance in Indonesia serves as more than entertainment and recreation. Many dances have a religious significance. They are performed to honour ancestors, in traditional ceremonies like weddings, births and deaths as well as yearly activities like harvesting. There are as many dances as there are provinces in the country. Within each province, there are many types and variations of dances. Although the dances mentioned here are but a small selection, their importance to the fabric of society cannot be denied.
Traditional ceremonial dances are still practised in Bali especially during the Galungan and Kuningan festivals. Galungan is a Balinese holiday that occurs every 210 days and lasts for 10 days, whereas Kuningan is the last day of the holiday. During this time, the Balinese gods are believed to visit the Earth. In Kalimantan, the Dayak people perform the tari mandau (sabre dance) which mimics the trailblazing action of clearing the forest. This dance which symbolises the fighting spirit of the people are performed during special ceremonial days. The Sanghyang trance dance is presented in Bali to ward off evil spirits. Java has a similar trance dance called Kuda Kepang.
Hudoq, Kalimantan, c1990.
Origin of Dance in Indonesia
It has been said that before the introduction of formal religion, the gods had powerful influence over the land and people of Indonesia. To induce the gods to answer their prayers, sovereigns proffered fresh flowers and fragrant incense. But the most refined offering is the gift of dance. Indonesian dances can be divided into three broad types: traditional religious dances, dramatised dances, folk and modern dances. Traditional religious dances are based on the belief that the dance would help people make contact with the gods, provide meaning to life or instill a force into things such as crops, fertility or war.
Gambuh is considered the oldest form of dance drama and the source for other dramatic dances. It was performed in the Javanese courts of the Majapahit kingdom and belongs to the semi-sacred or ceremonial group. The stories are usually drawn from the lives of the kings of East Java, very often from the Panji stories. Panji was a prince famed for his search for his beloved Princess Candra Kirana.
For about 100 years during Dutch colonial rule, dance lost its importance. After the country gained independence, a desire to express a sense of freedom and democracy prompted the revival of folk and regional dances. Society dances such as the ronggeng of West Java, the handkerchief dance and umbrella dance of the Bugis are primarily for entertainment and have no religious significance. On the other hand, the mask dance is one of the oldest traditions in Indonesian art and exists in almost every region. Many evolved from religious customs and rituals while others are purely for artistic pursuit.
Dances of Java
Yogyakarta and Surakarta, where the kraton (palaces) are located, are famous for the refined and graceful Javanese dances. There are several groups of dances from this region: the Wayang dances originally intended for ritual ceremonies; the sacred Bedojo and Srimpi court dances; the Beksan or War dance; and the dances of the villages.
The word ‘wayang’ means shadow. Originally wayang was performed by the head of the family to ask the spirits for guidance for important events like marriage and birth. With family members as witnesses, spirits were said to appear as shadows. Nowadays, current events, rules of behaviour and education form the basis of wayang stories. The different types of wayang include Wayang Kulit (leather puppet) Wayang Klitik (flat wooden puppet), Wayang Golek (wooden puppets) and the non-puppet ones of Wayang Beber (which use paper parchment as a backdrop) and Wayang Wong (human masked dances). The wayang stories are usually based on the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics.

Stamps: Wayang Golek and Wayang Kulit on stamps
Wayang kulit is a shadow puppet performance and is an integral part of temple festivals. The puppets are made of flat dried buffalo hide. The performance area has a screen and a light (an oil lamp in older days) and in front of the screen sits the Dalang or puppeteer, who conducts and plays the entire wayang. In front of him lie banana tree stems where the puppets are stuck when not in use; bad characters on the left and good ones on the right. At the start and end of the performance, the dalang will place the gunungan in front of the screen. The stage represents life on earth. The dalang symbolises God, the screen is the universe and the banana trunk where the puppets rest is earth. Hinduism first arrived in Indonesia followed closely by Buddhism in the early centuries. The Hindu influence is evident in the shadow puppet stories with themes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana.
The Gunungan or Kayon is used to start and end the play, as well as change one scene to another. It represents the Tree of Life and the unity of the cosmic order. Two gatekeepers stand on both sides of the door to the spiritual temple. There are many versions of the gunungan depending on the local culture and social situation. Javanese gunungan have more symbols compared to those from Bali.
Bedojo, began within the walls of the courts of Jogjakarta to mark ceremonies like the sultan’s birthday and special anniversaries. It is performed by girls from the aristocracy. The Bedojo is a slow and deliberate dance performed by nine girls with faces made up like a traditional Javanese bride. On their heads they wear a diadem with a white bird feather. The Srimpi is similar to the Bedojo but less grand and performed by four women. Beksan or War dances are performed by pairs of men and women who retell the stories from some segments of Javanese literature. Away from the courts in the villages, people perform dances such as Ronggeng, Djoged, Handkerchief Dance, Reog and Kuda Lumping, some as courtship dances and others as celebratory dances.

Dances of Bali
Music and dance are integral to religious ceremonies and social activity of Balinese life. This island has one of the most intriguing selections of dances. In areas where people practise Buddhism and the Bali-Hindu faith, spirits are often summoned to enter living humans and puppets. This is especially evident in the Sanghyang and Barong dances. The Sanghyang is a trance dance ritual where pre-adolescent girls perform under a hypnotic influence. This dance is performed to ward off disasters or epidemics.
Kecak is probably the most recognisable Balinese dance. With an all-male chorus chanting “cak, cak, cak” in overlapping sequence, the effect is both hypnotic and mystifying. The Kecak is a vocal chant originating from the Sanghyang dance. The Rejang is a sacred dance performed in the inner court of the temple during offerings and celebrations. It is a group dance by pre-adolescent girls, unmarried or older women. They are said to be heavenly maidens who have come to earth.1 The male equivalent is the Baris Gede or warrior dance.

Balinese mask dances have existed for over a century. Like the older types of dances, mask dances were used to drive out evil spirits that could cause havoc to crops. Prayers are said at every step of the mask preparation, from the selection of the tree to the performance. Bali’s Topeng dance-drama often portrays stories based on the lives of the Balinese kings. Early masks have mouthpieces which the actor bites to hold the mask in place. Today, the masks are tied to the face.
Topeng Pajegan is a monodrama as all the roles are portrayed by one dancer. The stories are usually derived from the chronicles of the kings. Depending on the occasion: wedding, tooth-filing ceremony2 or birth, the performer will choose the story most appropriate for the occasion. The characters appear in a fairly typical sequence. The Patih, a minister of strong character with a red face indicating bravery is first to appear. He is usually followed by a coarse brown face Patih and then a wise old man (Topeng Tua).
The last character to appear is Sidhakarya3. After he gives offerings and prayers to the gods he immediately gives chase to the children in the audience. When he catches a child, he carries him to the shrine and holds him up to the gods. The child is then released and rewarded with a small gift of Chinese coins, as a symbol of prosperity. In current times, the Sidhakarya segment does not happen very often.
The Topeng Panca is performed by five dancers during temple festivals. The full mask characters such as the king and ministers do not speak but deliver their ideas through elegant and graceful movements. Half-masked characters like the clown servants tell the stories.
The Barong is a mythological creature that performs stories that are entwined with black magic and some form of trance. With its big eyes, clacking mouth and furry body, it patrols the village streets clearing away dark forces that bring harm to the land and people. Rangda with her fearful mask is the witch-widow and Queen of Black Magic. She is portrayed with a long hanging tongue, fangs and long hair. In the magical Calonarang dance, the Barong and Rangda characters are pitched against each other in a classic battle between the good and evil.
The creation of wayang wong was initiated by Dalem Gede Kusamba, ruler of Klungkung from 1772-1825. He commissioned a new dance based on the Ramayana epic using a collection of royal masks. Following the wayang kulit style, wayang wong was created with human performers instead of puppets. Wayang wong is performed during the holy days of Galungan and Kuningan. As the masks are sacred, they are kept in the temple and are blessed before and after use.
Dances of Sumatra and other Islands
In Sumatra, the influence and presence of ancient dances are less evident because the faster paced and social dances are favoured. There are fewer Ramayana and Mahabharata themed dances except around the areas of Batak and South Sumatra. Dances which originated from the worship of the various gods are still performed although the region’s prevailing customary law (adat) and religion now cast an overriding influence.
Various dances of Sumatra on stamps.
Dance and the Dragon
The huge Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) lives in a hostile environment with little food and water. It overcame all these challenges and remained fairly untouched by evolution and the Ice Age. The existence of the Komodo dragon is proof of its tenacity.
The prehistoric-looking reptile serves as a perfect foil to the refined dance. The reptile’s appearance is beastly, it walks with an awkward gait and displays an amazing instinctive power when it attacks. The dance on the other hand has graceful and refined movements and the technique is acquired through many years of strict training. The Komodo dragon commands respect in its environment and the dance pays reverence to the gods. Although the elegant dance and the awkward Komodo dragon seem worlds apart, there is an interesting link between them. Note the posture of the dancers – the limbs, body, neck and head – with many movements involving raised elbows, and angled torso. Observe the Komodo dragon’s swagger, every step taken with limbs at an angle. Is it pure coincidence or a case of art imitating nature?
A ‘fire-breathing’ Dragon
The fire-breathing dragons as told by ancient mariners who visited the Spice Islands are in reality Komodo Dragons. They are the largest living species of lizard. These venomous lizards can grow to a length of two to three metres weighing about 150 kilograms. Komodo National Park is located at the Lesser Sunda Islands which covers the larger islands of Komodo, Rinca and Pada. Founded in 1980, the national park is also a popular location for scuba diving as the marine biodiversity includes whale sharks, manta rays, pygmy seahorses, sponges and corals.

  ""... [W]e cannot depend on other people -- white man, black man, yellow man, whoever it might be -- to look after us; we must look after ourselves. You see, this is our country and we've got to rule ourselves.""
- Gerald De Cruz, Organising Secretary of the Malayan Democratic Union (MDU),
Singapore's First Political Party Formed in 1945, in an Oral History Interview, September 1981
In sharing the political vision he once held for post-war Singapore, Gerald De Cruz captured the prevailing mood among an emerging class of young leaders who were determined to rid Singapore of colonial rule after the British returned at the end of the Japanese Occupation. This marked the awakening of a political consciousness among the masses in Singapore that led to the determined struggle for decolonization and self-rule -- the part of the national narrative most Singaporeans today are familiar with. Lesser known perhaps, but equally important to Singapore's post-war history, were the men-on-the-street whose lives and stories during this period played a part in shaping Singapore's quest to build a national identity as it journeyed towards nationhood.
A collaboration between the National Archives of Singapore and the National Museum of Singapore, 45-65: Liberation, Unrest... a New Nation traced Singapore's post-war history from 1945 to 1965 through six different themes. Using selected artefacts and a range of archival materials such as photographs, oral history interviews, as well as historical documents and footage, 45-65 provided an objective perspective of everyday life in Singapore in the two decades leading up to independence. Just as it illustrated the hardships and challenges faced by the people of Singapore during this tumultuous period, the exhibition offered a glimpse of the cultural dynamism that was prevalent then, thus giving Singaporeans and other visitors today an opportunity to look at how the nation was formed.

Although there was widespread jubilation following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the sense of triumph was soon replaced by a sobering atmosphere as Singapore's immediate post-war years were marked by pressing social and welfare needs. Living conditions were abysmal as the problems of overcrowding continued after the war, forcing families to live in crammed and filthy slums and squatters that had poor ventilation and lacked proper sanitation. Severe shortages of food and healthcare plagued the population, which was also threatened by outbreaks of fire and diseases due to the poor living conditions and overcrowded situation.
There was a sharp increase in Singapore's population in the years immediately following the Japanese Occupation, and overcrowding was a major problem. (1950s).

Yet, in spite of these challenges, this period saw the brewing of an early national consciousness, shaped by the voluntary spirit of locals who rallied to provide welfare support on the ground for a common social cause. The Social Welfare Department (SWD), for example, started a chain of popular ""People's Kitchen"" in 1946 that offered affordable but nutritious meals to the needy.

A similar programme, the Children's Feeding Scheme, was established in 1947, where the SWD supplied free meals to malnourished children. In the face of urgent healthcare needs, and as the colonial administration attempted to curb the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera and small pox, volunteers also offered their help in providing free healthcare services including mass immunisations and x-ray screenings for the people.

Theme II: Stirrings of Discomfort
With the image of the all-powerful Western imperialists shattered in World War Two, the widespread social and welfare problems in post-war Singapore soon became sources of discontent that fuelled the spread of political agitation against the colonial government. Different groups within the local population tapped on the ongoing issues of food shortages, unemployment and poor living conditions, many workers participated in strikes instigated by the communist-influenced trade unions, as illustrated by the Hock Lee Bus riots in 1955.
Trade union activism at the that time also saw active participation by students from Chinese-medium schools, whose grievances against the colonial government centred on the relative lack of job opportunities and government aid compared to students from other language-medium schools. Prior to the Hock Lee Bus riots - during which they, too, joined the pickets - the Chinese middle school1 students had organized their own demonstrations to protest against the National Service Ordinance which took effect in 1954, seeing military conscription as a form of colonial oppression that would disrupt their studies.

They were protesting against the detention of four student leaders and expulsion of 142 students from Chinese High School and Chung Cheng High School for pro-communist activities. (1956).

Apart from labour and student riots, communal tensions and inter-ethnic conflict were other causes of violent unrests in the 1950s and 1960s. The Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 and the communal clashes that broke out during Prophet Muhammad's birthday celebrations in 1964 are stark reminders of a turbulent period in Singapore's history.
Theme III: Political Awakening
As the process of decolonization spread across Asia after World War Two, calls for self-government in Singapore gained momentum amid post-war uncertainties and instability. Young, educated members of a disaffected class began to organise themselves, coming together to discuss the shortcomings of the government and plan their course of action, with the ultimate goal for Singapore to break away from colonial rule. It was under such a climate of political awakening that Singapore's constitutional development got underway, as the British took cautious steps to introduce greater local participation in government elections from 1948 to 1959.

The breakthrough came after the Rendel Commission of 1953 increased electoral powers, which led to David Marshall becoming Singapore's first Chief Minister of 1955. This was followed by three rounds of constitutional talks with the British to negotiate self-government for Singapore, culminating in the country's first election for a fully-elected Legislative Assembly in 1959. The 1959 General Election was won by the People's Action Party (PAP), and Lee Kuan Yew was sworn in as the first Prime Minister of Singapore.
Theme IV: Towards Nation-building
One of the tasks the PAP embarked on after winning the 1959 General Election was to carry out the social transformation it had promised the people, as the government looked to laying the grounds for building the nation. This included kick-starting Singapore's industrial development, and improving workers' welfare, the healthcare system, housing, education and transport. Dr Goh Keng Swee, then Minister for Finance, called for the formation of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) in 1961 to super the country's economic growth through industrialisation and investment promotion, driven by the priority to provide enough jobs for the people given the massive unemployment at that time.

Equal impetus was given to resolving Singapore's housing problems, with the Housing and Development Board (HDB) set up in 1960 to build mass public housing to ease the overcrowding situation.

Primary healthcare was also made more accessible to the people of Singapore as hospitals were modernised and mobile clinics were started, while health education and mass campaigns against diseases were launched. Reforms were implemented in the classrooms, too, as the education system was streamlined and improved to cater to the differing needs of the people.
At the same time, the PAP leaders recognised the importance of developing a sense of identity among the people, which they believed was tied to creating a Malayan culture in Singapore. Led by then Minister for Culture S Rajaratnam, the government sought to foster a multicultural and multiracial Malaya identity through the Aneka Ragam Rakyat (People's Cultural Concerts), a series of outdoor traditional shows organized to foster better understanding among the different ethnic groups. The National Loyalty Week was also held in 1959 to introduce national symbols including the state flag and national anthem to the people, which the government hoped would encourage a sense of loyalty among the people to the new nation.
Theme V: Cultural Life
Diverse cultural activities were already taking place on the ground at the time the government started to introduce initiatives and programmes aimed at promotion a sense of common Malayan identity among the people. While the PAP had created the People's Association (PA) to cultivate racial harmony and social cohesion among the population via recreational activities in community centres, such communal interactions were also playing out in public spaces including the three ""World"" amusement parks2, cinemas, and the Singapore Badminton Hall. Scenes of people from different ethnic backgrounds mingling with one another were common at these venues, as they came together to enjoy boxing matches, cultural dances, movies and sports.

Theme VI: Merger and Separation
When Singapore attained self-government in 1959, it symbolised the culmination of a momentous period of political awakening that had begun in the aftermath of the Japanese Occupation in 1945. As the desire of the people to manage their own affairs grew, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was convinced that complete independence could only be achieved through merger with the Federation of Malaya. This would quell the mounting threat of communism in Singapore, and at the same time secure the country's economic future as Malaya would provide a hinterland and common market for Singapore's manufactured goods.
However, Federation Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman did not share the same vision. He viewed the merger with Singapore's predominantly Chinese population as a threat to the privileged position of the Malays in Malaya, not to mention the threat of communism spreading to Malaya. In Singapore, the political party Barisan Sosialis - founded by left-wing members of the PAP who were expelled from the party in 1961 - also resisted the idea of a merger, fearing that their democratic rights and personal freedom would be curtailed.
Singapore, however, did become a part of the Federation in September 1963, after the Tunku finally proposed the creation of Malaysia following the fears that a pro-communist government might take over in Singapore after the PAP's defeat in the 1961 by-election in Hong Lim.
It was a union fraught with tension. The Sukarno government of Indonesia was against the merger, viewing it as a neo-colonial conspiracy by the British, which led Indonesia on an armed campaigned against Malay during a period known as Konfrontasi (Confrontation) from 1963 to 1965. Relations between the governments of Singapore and Malaysia did not improve after the merger, with one of the thorns being the PAP's decision to contest the 1964 General Election in Malaysia, which the Malaysian government interpreted as a challenge to their political power. Social tensions were also heightened during the racial riots in 1964 between the Chinese and Malays in Singapore, during which 22 people were killed and 461 injured. Furthermore, merger with Malaysia did not produce the expected economic deliverance for Singapore, as the Malaysian common market proved to be a pipe dream. It soon became clear that these irreparable differences made disengagement inevitable. On 9 August 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became an independent and sovereign state.

A New Chapter
""The misfortunes that befell Singapore in the first decade of her existence, from a self-governing state to a full independent republic, are forgotten by observers who believe ours has been a smooth and easy transition to self-sustaining growth. The truth is quite the reverse...""
- Dr Goh Keng Swee, A Socialist Economy That Works (1976).
The status Singapore enjoys today as an independent nation state, together with its social and economic stability, were built on the foundations laid during the difficult post-war years. From political strife to economic uncertainty and social unrest, the challenges Singapore faced from 1945 to 1965 had shaped its formative years as a fledging nation in its quest to build a national identity and secure independence.
Through this exhibition, visitors were able to gain an insight into the daily lives of the people during these two decades, a time when bread and butter issues - food shortages, housing and healthcare woes - were the main concerns of families in Singapore. At the same time, Singaporeans today had the opportunity to understand how these 20 years had set in motion the nation-building process and played a part in moulding the Singapore we know now.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2014
""Really?
The Singapore Botanic Gardens, a UNESCO World Heritage Site?""
This incredulity is one of the common sentiments I heard expressed when I spread the good news about the Singapore Botanic Gardens being nominated in 2014 as the nation's first UNESCO World Heritage Site. Also: ""Why the Botanic Gardens?""
Why, indeed? That's exactly what the exhibition ""More than a Garden"" sought to address. To understand the nomination, we first need to consider what the World Heritage List is really all about. To many, it is a prestigious compilation of the world’s greatest historical and cultural treasures marked for preservation for all the world to share forever. That it is. But there is also a greater story of humanity that unfolds through this collection of Sites, and each Site on the list is meant to reflect one or more aspects of this grand narrative.
In 2014, there were 981 World Heritage Sites dotted across the globe, in 160 member states. Of all the states that have ratified the 1972 UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, only 30 did not yet have a World Heritage Site to their name. Singapore was one of these, due in some part to its newness as a nation and its petite size.
But for a nation so new, Singapore's Botanic Gardens has a relatively long history (it turned 155 in April 2014). And for a nation so small (and highly urbanised, and densely populated), it occupies a fairly large plot of prime land. Viewed solely in terms of time and space, the Botanic Gardens is unique in Singapore’s context.
However, to rise to the status of a World Heritage Site, the site needed to possess more than local significance. So, of what value is our Gardens to the rest of the world?
First, the Gardens is the cradle of the rubber industry of Southeast Asia, which in turn has been the major source of natural rubber for the world since the 1920s - Southeast Asia accounts for 75% of all natural rubber produced in the world today. Versatile and useful, natural rubber moves people, literally. It is used in tyres – of planes, automobiles, motorcycles – and in shoe soles. Because it remains impermeable even though it is elastic, it is also used in latex gloves and contraceptives. There are also a myriad of other ways in which rubber is a part of our daily lives – even when we don’t notice it – by providing a coating to many of our everyday items!
So you could say, perhaps, that the abundance of these items today around the world was due to the pioneering work done at the Singapore Botanic Gardens on the cusp of the 20th century. There, the First Director of the Gardens, Henry Nicholas Ridley, perfected the art of tapping latex from rubber trees.
Up until this time, rubber trees (in particular the Hevea brasiliensis, the most productive of all rubber tree species) were grown in Brazil, their native land. Ridley not only did scientific work on rubber, he also promoted it widely in Singapore and Malaya, which led to the rise of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia.
Using a series of panels, More than a Garden followed this exceptional story of rubber, and celebrated all things rubber.
Installation of rubber tires
Due to the work done at the Gardens, rubber became a vital part of our economy, and this is exemplified in the lives of four of Singapore’s rubber pioneers – Tan Chay Yan, Tan Kah Kee, Lim Nee Soon and Lee Kong Chian – whose stories are featured in the exhibition.
It was not just the rubber plant that was experimented on in the Botanic Gardens.
The orchid, too, bloomed into fame, for it was from here that the commercial orchid breeding industry in Singapore and Southeast Asia began. And today, the Gardens is one of the top orchid research centres in the world.
It is such a core part of our Singapore identity that we have also given to various heads of states and celebrities from all over the word, as special gifts, orchids that have been named after them! At More than a Garden, visitors could celebrate this national flower - a scent-suous orchid photographic installation, for example, that surely appealed to their senses with its accompanying delicate orchid fragrances.
Besides its role in cultivating rubber and orchids, the Gardens is also part of a network of gardens that was important to the British Empire for the pursuit of botanical knowledge and commercial gain. The headquarters of these other tropical gardens was at Kew Gardens. It was also here that plants were tested for cultivation.
Of all the botanic gardens that were laboratories for the British Empire, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is the most well-preserved as it retains, to a large extent, its original layout.
Map of the Botanic Gardens
The Gardens was laid out in a typical English style, which means it was intentionally designed to look like it had naturally sprung from the ground (as opposed to other more formal and symmetrically ordered gardens elsewhere). Much of this is still visible today – the winding paths, the undulating topography and water features (The Gardens’ Swan Lake, by the way, is the oldest ornamental water body in Singapore – landscaped in 1866). While the Gardens is laid out to look natural, it actually does have some features that are genuinely natural. For example, the Gardens is home to several trees that pre-date its establishment, and it is the only city botanic garden in the Eastern hemisphere that contains a piece of rainforest (six hectares of the original flora of Singapore, in our case)!
The Gardens also contains 13 conserved buildings and structures at the time of writing, some of which have been used for various special occasions. Burkill Hall, the oldest building in the Gardens, was where Ridley resided; and Holttum Hall, the newly converted Heritage Museum, was where orchid research was first carried out in the Gardens.
Despite its nomination as a World Heritage Site to be shared with the world, the Botanic Gardens is still very much Singapore’s garden. The roots of the greening movement in Singapore can be traced back there. As early as the 1880s, it housed a nursery that grew trees that were later transplanted to roads around Singapore!
It also played a significant role in the fostering of racial harmony. It was the first site chosen for the Aneka Ragam Ra’ayat (Malay for ‘People’s Variety Show’) in 1959, where Chinese, Malays, and Indians took the stage together for the first time and performed a variety of cultural items. Audience members of different races enjoyed the Chinese songs, the Indian dance, and some even learnt how to play the angklung!
During the launch of the show, our prime minister at the time, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, explained why the Gardens was chosen as the series’ first venue:
“It is fitting that the first of these concerts should be held in the Botanic Gardens, for, in a way, this beautiful place symbolises what we all want. Not only are beautiful things grown here, but some of the shrubs, flowers and trees are foreign importations which have taken root in [our] soil... Here, under open skies, Malays, Chinese, Indians, will, I hope, discover the materials for a national art and national culture.”
For all the big-picture history the Gardens possesses, it’s also a place close to the heart of many Singaporeans.
Over the past few months, as I ploughed through old news about the Gardens, and collected various memories, I’ve found that there are so many stories (some quite amusing) that make the Gardens truly more than a garden to many.
Countless pre-wedding photographs have been shot there (perhaps taken in the hope that their marriages will last as long as the Gardens have?), and the swans have been fed by many a passer-by – one of them was actually my friend who almost fed the swan her finger too. For years, the Gardens has also been a place of refuge from urban life (or for teenagers who wanted to run away from home, or just escape school for a bit), and so much more.
All these reasons make the Gardens so unique – it is international in significance, but very much local in flavour. It is a place of the awesome and the ordinary, the unique and the ubiquitous... It is indeed a garden for Singapore, and for the world.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Yoshie-Osawa-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"“You will enjoy learning about Singapore’s history and change your own history!” This is what Yoshie Osawa was told when she moved to Singapore in 1992. And, she found it to be true, especially when she became a docent here.
Yoshie moved to Singapore when she married a Singaporean. Through one of the oldest docent groups in Singapore, Yoshie began to learn a great deal about Singapore’s history. The Japanese Docents (JD) group was formed in 1981. When you enter the National Museum of Singapore (NMS), you may notice that many of the captions with Japanese translations are done by the JD. Japanese tours are also conducted at the Museum. Yoshie guides mainly at the National Museum and also at the Singapore Arts Museum, Peranakan Museum, and the Singapore Musical Box Museum.
How it started
What started Yoshie on this journey of studying Singapore’s history was a visit she made with her friend who was guiding at the Asian Civilisations Museum. The exhibition was “Journey of Faith: Art and History from the Vatican Collection”. Her friend was able to talk about the artefacts and exhibits even though she was not a Catholic. Yoshie was so impressed that she decided to become a docent. After two to three months of training, Yoshie started guiding in 2006. The Japanese docents organise their own training by having the senior docents undertake the mentoring and training of newly enrolled ones. Yoshie also did the Japanese-related tours in Singapore as a part of the National Heritage Festival.
Yoshie has met a relative of Singapore’s earliest Japanese resident who lived in the Upper Wilkie Road house that was known as Osborne House at Emily Hill. The house was bought by a Singapore-based Japanese, Jukichi Ikeda. His nephew’s daughter, who is 83-year-old Miyoko Sato (Yoshida), visited the home she lived in last as a 5-year-old. The photographers and media gathered to meet her when she came to Singapore after having left it at such an early age. It was a pivotal moment for many, including Yoshie. Miyoko’s photos are exhibited at “Witness To War: Remembering 1942” at NMS in 2017. Some of the photos were donated to the National Archive.
Yoshie feels that Singapore and the National Heritage Board (NHB) have been extremely kind to allow for these memories to be kept alive. Mamoru Shinozaki, whose photo hangs at the National Museum, is considered the “Oskar Schindler of Singapore” during the war. He is more famous in Singapore than in Japan. Early this year, Shinozaki’s relative visited NMS. His relatives did not know about Mamoru Shinozaki’s fame in Singapore. For the Japanese docents, it is an exciting and important story to tell.
Japanese docents
According to Yoshie, the JD group is grateful to the National Heritage Board for allowing them to do Japanese tours. As a people, they love to learn about the history and culture of the places they move to. Yoshie highlights this point and says “Many Japanese join the museum as volunteers and totally immerse themselves so deep in the learning. They study everything about Singapore and learn so much. And, among ourselves we all have a common interest. Everybody enjoys guiding.”
The Singapore Musical Box Museum and Japan
Yoshie started to guide at another museum two years ago — the Singapore Musical Box Museum. Naoto Orui is its founder. Half of them are from the U.K. The museum aims to share the historical background of the musical boxes and how they made their way to Singapore. While there is usually someone to operate the musical boxes, Yoshie enjoys guiding at this very special museum. Yoshie points out that the museum staff who operate the instruments speak English, Japanese, and Chinese. Yoshie herself speaks both English and Japanese. She has learnt Mandarin but does not speak it as well as she would like to.
Yoshie, unlike many of the other Japanese docents, will remain in Singapore well into the future. Most of the other docents are wives of expatriate husbands and may move on after two or three years. Yoshie, on the other hand, will continue to be here. Singapore is her home.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Muhammad-Hafiz-bin-Rashid-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"A songkok (a cap widely worn by Muslim males), a checked sarong (a tube of cloth worn around the waist by Malay Muslims), and a silky blue shirt .
A blangkon (a batik headdress worn by Javanese men), a batik sarong and a surjan (a long sleeved Javanese jacket which is often made from a striped fabric known as lurik) — this is what 26-year-old Muhammad Hafiz bin Rashid refers to as his “default attire”.
Sometimes his friends do not recognise him when he is not in this traditional attire. This young man takes pride in being an ethnic Malay, and it is a new-found phase in his life. The trigger for this came when he was a Polytechnic student. He went to the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC) for an exhibition on “Ilham Alham” which is about the medicinal qualities of plants. The outcome was a hunger to explore his roots. It led to him becoming a docent at MHC.
Becoming a docent
Hafiz became a frequent visitor to the MHC. His visits to the MHC were noticed by a staff member who, in turn, suggested that he volunteer as a guide. He jumped at the idea because with that would come training and a chance to learn more about his own roots. “It helped me to learn more about my own heritage which I was not really aware of previously,” said Hafiz. He became one of its youngest guides.
Hafiz is quick to point out that many people assume that, as a Malay, he would be better informed than most about his own heritage. He says that going to the museum makes you appreciate your own culture and heritage a lot more.
The rigorous two- to three-month training that he underwent to become a guide was also a huge plus. He used to have a huge gap in knowledge about his ethnic heritage. During docent training, he had the best of knowledge-providers. They were from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and National University of Singapore (NUS). Hafiz recalls, “They told us about the history of Kampong Glam as well as certain cultural practices — the significance of the history, its origins, its influences — it’s really something that wasn’t taught in schools.”
A deeper appreciation of the Malay culture and heritage has grown for Hafiz as a result of becoming a guide.
Building on history
The visitors Hafiz meets while guiding is also another way for this full-time library officer to top-up on his knowledge. Take, for instance, Nenek Hasnah (“nenek” is Malay for granny). It was an instagramable-moment when the two met. In fact, it is now part of Hafiz’s instagram stories.
Nenek Hasnah was visiting MHC with her daughter. While taking her through the first gallery on the map of the Malay world, Nenek Hasnah started to speak of her personal experiences. Born of a Javanese mother and a Malay father, she made the treacherous journey with her family to Singapore. Their ship caught fire at the coast of Pulau Buaya and eventually they had no choice but to jump into the sea. Clearly, she survived and settled in Arab Street (then known as Kampong Java). She remembers the Arab Street of old very well, including her neighbours.
Hafiz keeps in touch with his new-found friend and uses her stories in his guided tours.
Tracing their Malay roots
Hafiz has had interesting encounters with overseas Malays. He has a great deal of respect for them because they have come a great distance to trace their ancestry. Those are times Hafiz is also grateful for the opportunity of being a guide. “At least they leave the place enriched by that extra piece of knowledge that I was able to impart,” he says.
For the local visitor, he likes giving them extra knowledge and he also likes the fact that he might be “peeling away the misconceptions” as well.
Visitors come from all over the world. Once he had the unexpected privilege of guiding Cape Malays from Capetown, South Africa. Hafiz had nothing but admiration for them — travelling all this way to discover their roots. He felt humbled and had a strong sense of responsibility to share all that he knows about this region and the Malays. In the same vein, Hafiz had a healthy exchange with the Cape Malays about their lives in South Africa and what it was like living through the apartheid era.
These visitors have made a deep impression on him. Thanks to the MHC visitors from far away, it has now become his dream to, in turn, visit his own family’s hometown — in Bawean island, Indonesia.
Growing as a docent
One great takeaway for Hafiz is that there is a great deal of mixing in Singapore with the other cultures and he gets to see the bigger picture.
To illustrate his point, he referred to his checked sarong. In this part of the world, it is a common design. But, he then highlights the fact that it was Indian traders who brought such designs to South East Asia in the first place.
To illustrate his point, he referred to his batik sarong. The motif on the sarong is known as tambal. He then explained that the tambal motif itself is a patchwork of different batik motifs - some of which are derived from Indian mythology such as the mythical Garuda, the bird mount of the Hindu god Vishnu.
He does not stop at appreciating such interlinks between cultures. Hafiz is now learning a new regional language — Kristang spoken by the local Portuguese-Eurasians. “It’s a melange of Malay and Portuguese and also some of the other languages such as Chinese dialects and even Indian languages.”
For this young Malay Singaporean, being a docent is far more than guiding at MHC — he is on his own journey to discover his roots and pass on his cultural heritage.

What is communication? The word originates from the Latin term communicare, meaning to “share” or “make common”. By exploring the development of communication, we can chart mankind’s progress across the fields of science, history and technology.
Text by Chua Mei Lin
BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2011
What is communication? The word originates from the Latin term communicare, meaning to “share” or “make common”. By exploring the development of communication, we can chart mankind’s progress across the fields of science, history and technology.
Before the advent of writing, men gathered to narrate stories and exchange ideas. Some daily routines and annual occurrences were recorded on walls, stones and bones. Later, the written and printed word encouraged learning and more people participated in this form of communication. With a little help from electricity, words were then transmitted over greater distances.
The tools of communication have gone through amazing transformations. Without missing a step, we call, email or text each other. Communication engages people and it draws the world closer. In Message Me, a 2011 exhibition at the Singapore Philatelic Museum, we reflected on men’s ingenuity in overcoming obstacles in the effort to share and in keep in touch.
Cuneiform and Hieroglyphs
In the prehistoric era, men communicated by speaking. Individuals talked to other people around them but not to those who were far away. A man could use his memory to store some information for the future but he had no way of saving it in other forms. To preserve the stories they knew, early man drew simple pictures on cave walls. Over time, these images became more detailed and complex and started to represent animals and objects encountered by early men. This was the beginning of writing.
Clay remnants found in the Mesopotamia region show shapes of animals, food and clothes. Some of the earliest forms of writing can be traced to the Sumerians of Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE. Clay was an early writing surface but it was not easy to use. Depending on the writing tool used, the lines could be of different thicknesses.
Instead of curves, wedge-shaped lines were used. This wedge-shaped writing is known as cuneiform script.
When cities were first built, their inhabitants began to specialise in different fields of work. Some became farmers or herders of animals, while others worked as craftsmen making pottery and baskets. Traders helped to exchange goods. Very often, the products of one city were traded in other towns. To keep track of these items and their movements, early traders used clay tablets to record their goods.
Hieroglyphic script appeared in Egypt around 3,100 BCE. The ancient Egyptians started with pictograms (picture signs) and phonograms (sound signs).
Ideograms – signs that represent ideas or things – were introduced later.
For a long time, nobody could translate the hieroglyphs until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 by a French soldier with Napoleon’s army in Egypt. It took Frenchman Jean-François Champollion 15 years before he made the connections and deciphered the hieroglyphs in 1822.
Alphabet and Writing
Not everybody can draw, and given the sheer number of things to be represented, the alphabet was invented. The alphabet is a selection of consonant and vowel sounds which form words when strung together. The English language, for instance, comprises words made up of 26 letters. The Chinese written language uses nine basic strokes, but when combined, these create a vocabulary of more than 100,000 characters. In its simplest form, the Tamil language has 12 vowels, 18 consonants and one special character.
What did man use to write in the early days? During the Stone Age, men wrote on pre-existing materials such as rocks, bones and cave walls. Clay tablets later provided a handy surface but were heavy and required laborious preparation before they could be used. The ancient Egyptians used papyrus, a paper-like material made from the pith of an aquatic sedge native to the Nile River. In the Middle Ages, leather and parchment made from animal skin were used for manuscripts. Around the 2nd century CE, Cai Lun, an official at the Chinese court of Emperor He of the eastern Han dynasty, invented paper. Europeans learnt about paper much later in the 12th century when the Venetian Marco Polo visited China.
To write, the ancient Egyptians used the trimmed ends of reeds. Metal styluses were used in the Roman Empire, but due to an alarmingly high number of stabbings, they were banned and replaced by bone and ivory tools. In the Middle Ages, writing was done using quill pens obtained from duck and goose feathers. A scribe would dip the sharpened end of the quill into a jar of ink, tap off the excess ink and put quill to paper. As quills wore out very quickly, some people turned to more lasting materials such as horn and tortoiseshell.
Much later, the Briton Samuel Harrison crafted pen points of metal in 1780 and this marked the birth of modern steel pens. The fountain pen was patented by Lewis Edson Waterman, an American, in 1884. With an internal reservoir of ink, this tool advanced the art of writing to a new level. In 1945, the Hungarian László József Bíró invented the portable and disposable ballpoint pen.
Letters of Note
Ever since writing was invented, letters served to bridge distances between people. Letters nurtured relationships, maintained friendships, conveyed condolences and best wishes, and even provided missing pieces of information for historians and biographers of notable personalities.
Some letters are serious and historic. For example, the physicist Albert Einstein wrote to US President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 to warn him of the German government’s interest in developing atomic weapons. This letter prompted the formation of an Advisory Committee on Uranium and the start of America’s nuclear research programme.
How much is a love letter worth? A lot if you are John Keats, the great English poet of the Romantic Period. In March 2011, one of Keats’ love letters to his fiancée Frances (Fanny) Brawne fetched £96,000 at an auction in London.
Letters also provided a means of communication for early migrants. In the 1800s, many Chinese men landed in Singapore to seek jobs. These manual workers and coolies were mostly illiterate. Letter writers were in great demand by migrants who wanted to send money and messages back to their families in China. These letters provided an essential lifeline and a source of comfort for the workers.
Printing and Typing
Before the invention of the printing press, books were written by hand. This made books very special and expensive. The Chinese invented block printing some time in the 8th century. To make copies, pictures and text were carved on wooden blocks. The blocks were first coated with ink and a piece of paper was laid the surface and pressed to transfer the contents of the print. In the 11th century, Pi Sheng, a Chinese, made individual clay types, the world’s first movable type. A movable type consists of individual letters or characters that can be assembled and rearranged to form different words and texts. Pi Sheng’s clay types, however, broke easily and the sheer number of characters in the Chinese language made it impossible to carve enough types.
In 1450, the German Johannes Gutenberg developed movable metal types for printing. Using this method, he invented a press that was used to create the first printed book, the two-volume Gutenberg Bible. Printing revolutionised communication. As books became affordable and common, more people learnt to read and write and the dissemination of new ideas, discoveries and information became faster and more widespread.
The typewriter was invented by Christopher Latham Sholes, an American newspaper editor, in 1868. The original keyboard, with a layout commonly known as QWERTY, is still in use today. This arrangement of the letters on the keyboard prevented typists from working too fast, which caused the keys on the machine to jam. Confusingly, the first people who used Sholes’ invention were also called typewriters. Only later were they known as typists.
From Poniesto the Penny Post
In the old days, only royalty, religious leaders and the very rich could afford to send letters. Runners were employed to carry the letters. Later, horseback riders covered greater distances and achieved higher speeds using a relay system with fresh horses at regular stations. The most famous of these was the Pony Express of the American West. Another courier of correspondence and probably the earliest form of airmail was the carrier pigeon, which ferried messages attached to its legs or tail.
Ordinary people relied on the goodwill of travellers to carry their letters. Sometimes, the letters failed to reach their destination. As more people became literate and communicated with each other, the penny post was introduced in 1683. For a penny, the London penny post would convey messages anywhere within the city of London. This was the beginning of a postal service for the masses.
Very few people in ancient times knew how to read and write, including kings and queens. Scribes, people who specialised in writing, therefore played a very important role in ancient civilisations. They took note of offerings made at temples, recorded tributes paid to the rulers, wrote contracts and accounts for traders, penned wills and generated official correspondence.
In the Middle Ages, under the patronage of kings, wealthy nobles and powerful religious orders, scribes documented historical events, judicial and legal records, and copied books and sacred texts. But with the invention of printing in the 15th century, these professional writers soon lost their importance.
Smoke and Mirrors
Signals are messages communicated without words. Like doorbells and sirens, they usually convey only one simple message. Primitive tribes sent messages by beating drums which could be heard at a distance by other tribes. Signals that use visual means include smoke, fire and light. Native Americans used blankets to control the smoke over a fire as a method of sending messages to distant tribes. On a good day, these signals could be seen from afar. But this technique was not possible on windy days or at night.
Another way of sending messages was to reflect sunlight on mirrors. As early as the 5th century BC, the Greeks were already using sunlight reflected on metal mirrors to convey signals. In 1867, British Royal Navy Captain Philip Colomb introduced the use of a lantern to send messages from ship to ship. A few years later, the British inventor Arthur Aldis built an electrically powered signal lamp which was faster and brighter. Light continues to be a warning system in functions such as lighthouses and traffic lights.
Flying the Flag
Semaphore signalling uses an alphabet-based flag system. A signal man holds up two bi-coloured flags to indicate alphabets, numbers or a universal standard code. Naval communication flags have been used since the days of Christopher Columbus when he explored the New World.
Ensigns are national flags displayed by ships to show their origin and status: friend or foe. Naval signal flags are governed by the International Code of Signals. Ship crews of all nationalities understand and use this universal messaging system. During Singapore’s early years, flags were flown at Fort Canning. They signalled the arrival of a ship with mail. A red ensign indicated the arrival of European ships while a yellow flag stood for ships from China. In the night, residents were informed of arriving mail by the firing of a gun.
The Birth of Modern Telecommunication
In the 1830s, the American inventor Samuel Morse devised the telegraph system and this marked the beginning of modern long-distance communication. Using electric currents to represent letters or numbers, an operator taps on a transmitter to produce short or long buzzes. A short buzz is called a dot and a long one is called a dash. Combined, these dots and dashes spell out a message. The most famous is the universal code dot-dot-dot, dash-dash-dash, dot-dot-dot for “SOS” in emergencies.
In Britain, the first successful telegraph line was built in 1837 by William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone. This system was originally used by railway operators to send messages to stations about train services. Later, underwater sea cables connected continents. The first telegraph link using this method was between Britain and France in 1850. A submarine telegraph link was eventually laid out between Europe and America after many unsuccessful attempts.
Several inventors in America and Europe were developing the telephone at around the same time but it was Alexander Graham Bell who made the breakthrough in 1876. Bell allegedly cried, “Mr Watson, come here. I want you” when he spilled battery acid on his clothes. His colleague Thomas Watson, who was in the next room, heard Bell’s voice over a wire. Thus the telephone was invented.
Today, instead of wires, our voices are converted into beams of light and transferred through thin strands of glass called optical fibres. It was said that in 1891, an American funeral parlour owner named Almon Strowger was so upset with the bad service of the switchboard telephone operators that he invented the automatic telephone exchange.
New Waves of Communication
Radio waves travel through the air and do not need wires – making them very useful for establishing contact with airplanes and ships. Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, discovered radio waves in the 1880s. Based on Hertz’s discovery, the Italian Guglielmo Marconi experimented with transmitting radio waves and successfully sent a “wireless telegraph” across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901.
In 1906, using radio waves, Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden made the first radio broadcast of voice and music. As early as 1927, engineers were experimenting with sending pictures using radio waves. After solving some major technical difficulties, television broadcasting arrived in the houses of the general public in the late 1940s and quickly became the most popular form of home entertainment and communication in the 20th century.
Making Communication Mobile
Primitive mobile phones made their first appearance in the 1940s but it took another forty years before these devices became affordable and practical. Early mobile phones weighed about 34 kg and were mainly fitted in cars. Besides making calls, mobile phones today, or more correctly smart phones, are multiple usage devices. They enable us to send text and video messages, exchange email, browse the Internet, play games, capture images, make voice recordings, play music, listen to the radio and navigate using the global positioning system or GPS.
The first text message was apparently sent by Neil Papworth, a young test engineer, from his personal computer to a friend’s phone on Christmas 1992. Text messaging is probably the most highly used mobile data service. The activity is so popular that “texting” and other similar phrases have entered the mainstream lexicon. Interestingly, text messages and ancient Egyptian writing share a similarity – the use of rebus, meaning pictures or symbols that represent words. Text, numbers and pictures are often combined in a single message. For example, “i <3 u” uses the pictogram of a heart to represent love and convey a message that is simple and direct.
One-to-one communication is still prevalent, but staying in touch with large groups of people and the world en masse through mobile channels like Facebook and Twitter is becoming a major trend in smartphone usage.
The Internet, The World Wide Web and Email
The Internet has its origins in a 1950s military research project in the United States to counter Soviet missile threats. The early model was called SAGE; it had several keyboards and screens attached to one big computer. In 1969, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network or ARPANET was built. It allowed scientists in the US Department of Defense to share information.
This was a new type of computer network that would not break down even if one or more of the computers did not work. Large universities and other research institutions joined the network and made it a worldwide system of interconnected networks and computers. The Internet was introduced to the public in 1983. With about 14 billion users today, the Internet can be described as a global system of interconnected networks and computers.
The World Wide Web or Web is a way for information to be retrieved and distributed over the Internet. In the early years of the ARPANET, to find information, one needed to know where to look and use complex computer codes. Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, changed this when he created the World Wide Web. Initially the Web was meant only for scientists but in 1991 it was made available to the public. The Web uses computer languages like http (short for hypertext transfer protocol) to send information. To call up pages with graphics, sound, text and video, users access the web through software called browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox.
Electronic mail or email actually predates the Internet but it was the computer network at ARPANET that contributed to its development. Email started as a digital message board for scientists working on ARPANET where the @ address format was born.
Communication and You
Technology is advancing at an amazing pace and bringing people closer through faster and easier communication. With the advent of the Internet, all traditional forms of communications have become condensed and accelerated. Communication has become more rapid but not necessarily error-free.
What is communication to you?

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 1 - Apr to Jun 2015
An exhibition borne from a landmark book project on Singapore's early Modern architecture was held at the National Museum of Singapore from 17 April to 18 May as part of the Singapore HeritageFest 2015. Organised by National Museum of Singapore in partnership with Singapore Heritage Society, the exhibition was a showcase of the late Jeremy San Tzer Ning’s remarkable photography.
In documenting Singapore’s modern architectural heritage, the award-winning architectural photographer’s pictures pay tribute to the often overlooked, everyday structures that form the backdrop of our daily lives: public flats, places of worship, schools, markets and workplaces. Taken over 10 years, these selected photos capture the struggles and achievements of the milieu and Singapore’s endangered early Modernist architecture as it stood in the first decade of the 21st Century.
National Library
Inauguration: 1960 Architect: Public Works Department, Singapore.
The modest red-bricked structure, designed by Public Works Department architect Lionel Bintley, was inaugurated in 1960 by Singapore’s first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (or Head or State) Yusof bin Ishak. While the institution originated in 1823 as a private collection, philanthropist Lee Kong Chian gave a seed donation in the 1950s and rallied for a public library with publications in “vernacular languages”. Generations have since passed through its brick porches, as the understated Stamford Road library evolved into one of the few post-war civic spaces that Singaporeans, across class and ethnicity divides, identified with. Captured before the building’s demise, the photograph shows the library courtyard, an urban oasis graced by shady trees and a fountain, well-loved for poetry recitals and nursing a cup of coffee.
Trinity Theological College Chapel
Inauguration: 1970 Architect: Chan Kui Chuan.
The Trinity Theological College Chapel is an excellent example of later modern tropical church design that evolved from the 1950s. The building is replete with layers of religious symbolism. Occupying a wooded, undulating site on Mount Sophia, the chapel is a simple rectangular pavilion capped by a sculptural roof form, derived from the Chinese character 人 (“human”) — chosen as an appropriate representation of the chapel’s role as an interdenominational gathering space.
Tanjong Pagar Railway Station
Inauguration: 1932 Architect: Swan & Maclaren.
The former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station is gazetted as a National Monument, following the landmark June 2010 agreement that saw the transfer of the former Malayan railway land from Malaysia to Singapore. Underneath the graceful arches, inset panels with arabesque motifs are subtle local inflections in an otherwise internationalist design devoid of overt ethnic symbols, unlike the contemporaneous Federated Malay States Railway Headquarters in Kuala Lumpur.
National Stadium
Inauguration: 1973 Architect: Public Works Department, Singapore.
Designed by the Public Works Department of Singapore, the National Stadium was conceived as the centrepiece of the Kallang Park Sports Complex, a comprehensive mass spectator sports, leisure, and exhibition centre that would occupy the former landing grounds of Kallang Airport. For the subsequent three decades, the edifice was the unrivalled venue of numerous memorable matches and spectacular National Day Parades.
Clifford Pier
Inauguration: 1933 Architect: Public Works Department, Singapore.
Clifford Pier was inaugurated by Straits Settlements Governor Cecil Clementi in 1933. It was one of the three major transportation ‘gateways’ of interwar Singapore — the other two being Tanjong Pagar Railway Station (1932), and Kallang Airport (1937). Replacing the mid-nineteenth-century Johnston’s Pier, Clifford Pier was an engineering feat of its times, with its 10 reinforced concrete arched trusses 36 feet high and spanning 60 feet across, resulting in a column-free space that facilitated passenger traffic flow.
Pearlbank Apartments
Completion: 1976 Architect: Archurban Architects.
Sited atop Pearl’s Hill and towering over the densely populated shophouses of Kreta Ayer, the visionary project achieved several breakthroughs when it was built in 1976. As Singapore’s first urban renewal residential development, Pearl Bank was among the world’s most densely populated apartment blocks and the tallest apartment in Asia.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 1 – Jan to Mar 2014
In the course of preparing for the 2014 exhibition ‘A Changed World: Singapore Art 1950s-1970s’ one of the challenges that confronted my co-curator, Daniel Tham, and myself was the use of terms in discussions about modern art in Singapore. These terms in themselves demarcate boundaries which limit and exclude – and, in many instances, these boundaries are extremely ill-defined. The result is a problematic set of terms which one may, at best, use loosely, and with the utmost care due to their inadequacies. In particular, the contention over the use of the terms ‘pioneer’ and ‘second generation’ is one which we would like to explore further1. This article makes no attempt to resolve the issues of categorisation; rather, it aims to encourage readers to reflect on these terms, and to appreciate the richness and complexities of our art history.
Of The Term ‘Pioneer’: Inclusions and Exclusions
The term ‘pioneer artists’ is commonly used in writings on local art history. So who are these recognised ‘pioneers’ of our visual art history? Who are those who are consistently regarded as ‘pioneers’? Are there geographical and age limits that are attached to the term? From when do we chart the beginnings of our visual art history?
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term ‘pioneer’ refers to ‘a person or group that originates or helps open up a new line of thought or activity or a new method or technical development’, or ‘one of the first to settle in a territory’. If we were to combine both definitions, then the term ‘pioneer’ would refer only to immigrant artists, resulting in the loss of an important facet of our culturally diverse history as important non-immigrant artists would be excluded from this category. Geography and chronology further complicate matters, for the study of Singapore’s history and its art cannot be divorced from the history of Malaya, which, in turn, brings us back to the colonial period. And if we say our visual history has its roots in the colonial period, how early should we start tracking it, and on what grounds?
From the late 1980s to early 1990s, ‘pioneer’ status has been conferred on artists like Liu Kang, Cheong Soo Pieng, Chen Chong Swee, Chen Wen Hsi, Lim Hak Tai, Georgette Chen and Lim Cheng Hoe, with the latter three occasionally forgotten and omitted. All seven artists were Chinese immigrants who had settled in Singapore before and after World War II, trained and tutored a great number of art students, and later became full-time artists. The conferment of ‘pioneer’ status carries with it the understanding that these artists significantly impacted and contributed to the local art scene. While there is no doubt these seven artists deserved it, many more artists should be remembered as pioneers as well.
Artist Tsang Ju Chi, for example, is a forgotten pioneer. Trained in Shanghai and Paris, Tsang arrived in Singapore in the 1930s and actively organised art exhibitions featuring works depicting local subject matter. Although he was chiefly involved in commercial art, he was dedicated to promoting local art, especially in his capacity as the chairman of the Society of Chinese Artists. He also sought to groom young artists by organising the Youth Encouragement Society art exhibitions2. As a painter himself, he was known for his oil paintings of local Malay folk and fishermen. Unfortunately, none of Tsang’s works survived. He was killed in the Sook Ching massacre during the Japanese Occupation.
Besides Tsang, artists such as Suri Mohyani, M. Sawoot bin Haji Rahman and Mahat bin Chaadang, Lee Ta Pai, Liu Sien Teh, Chong Pai Mu, See Hiang To, Chen Jen Hao, Wu Tsai Yen, Fan Chang Tien, Chang Tan-Nung and Sunyee should be regarded as pioneer artists for their significant contributions as artists and art educators in our history. When examining our art history, it is also important to note the significance of Penang. Hence, the works of the pioneers who were active there - in particular, Abdullah Ariff and Yong Mun Sen - should be taken into account too when studying Singapore’s early art history. And if we were to rethink the constraints of time and space in our history, should we not regard the dedicated art inspector and artist Richard Walker - who made great contributions to the development of watercolour painting in Singapore and Malaya - as a ‘pioneer’ too?
‘Second Generation’: When Does It Begin?
The term ‘second generation’ probably began to appear in the late 1990s to early 2000s. It generally referred to artists who were most probably taught by ‘pioneer’ or ‘first generation’ artists. In many cases, it is assumed that the artists received training at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, or that they were taught by the ‘pioneers’ privately, or in classes held at Chinese medium schools. It is also believed that many of these ‘second generation’ artists received further training in art overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom, other European countries and the United States. Artists who went to these countries to study in the mid-1950s to the early 1970s, such as Thomas Yeo, Yeo Hoe Koon, Anthony Poon, Teo Eng Seng, Ng Eng Teng, Tan Teo Kwang, Wee Beng Chong and Goh Beng Kwan are generally categorised as ‘second generation’ artists. Choy Wen Yang, Lu Kuo Siang, Latiff Mohidin, and Eng Tow are also categorised as second generation artists due to their overseas training, but they were not taught by any first generation artists.
And then, there are the artists who did not have the opportunity to be trained overseas in Western countries - students of the ‘first generation pioneers’, who were successful in their own right. These include artists such as Tay Chee Toh, Tan Ping Chiang, See Cheen Tee, Foo Chee San and Koeh Sia Yong. Moreover, the term ‘second generation’ also implies that these artists stood for and embraced Western abstraction in their art3. For example, Tay Chee Toh is widely recognised as a ‘second generation’ artist. However, the boundaries start to blur again in the case of artists who were students of the first generation who did not embrace Western abstraction. These artists include Ong Kim Seng, a prominent watercolour artist; See Cheen Tee and Foo Chee San, who specialised in wood block printing; as well as Koeh Sia Yong and Chua Mia Tee, who adhered to realism throughout their careers.
Then there is the issue of time: when does the ‘second generation’ begin? Should the limits of a generation be defined, or should one only consider the peak of an artist’s career as the period of time that defines his or her generation? Can artists such as Lai Foong Moi, Foo Chee San, Choo Keng Kwang, Lim Tze Peng, Chua Mia Tee, Chen Cheng Mei and Yeh Chi Wei and Abdul Ghani Hamid – all of whom were born between 1910s and 1930s – be regarded as ‘second generation’? How should we categorise these artists, who do not fit the mould of ‘pioneers’ or ‘second generation’ artists? Or should we simply ignore these categorisations and honour these artists for their unique contributions to our art history?
Indeed, the use of the terms ‘pioneer’ and ‘second generation’ throws up more questions than answers, raising issues that will not be immediately – or ever – resolved. This is because the reality of art-making and its history is not one of neat and convenient categorisations. The spirit of a milieu can be ingrained in an artist’s works but if he/she is to be called an ‘artist’ in the first place, his or her unique voice has to come through and withstand the test of time - and transcend boundaries.
Szan Tan is Curator, National Museum of Singapore
The contentions surrounding the use of the term and category ‘first generation pioneers’ and ‘second generation’ were first raised in 2007 by Wang Zineng in his endnotes to the article ‘Curatorial Notes’, in the exhibition catalogue ‘Bodies and Relationships: Selected works of Lee Sik Khoon’, presented by NUS Museums.
2 Hsu, Marco (translated by Lai Chee Kein), A brief history of Malayan Art, Millennium Books, Singapore, 1999.
3 The abstract works of these artists should not be seen merely as imitations or derivations of Nicholson, Rothko, Motherwell, De Kooning, Pollock, Kline or Hoffman for their expressions possess a universality that transcends space and time. At times an Eastern spirit can be detected in the use of strokes, lines, and composition.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/lee-kuan-yew/story,"TL;DR
Lee Kuan Yew (16 September 1923–23 March 2015), the founder of modern Singapore, was a brilliant statesman and highly-regarded visionary who transformed the island into a formidable nation and economic powerhouse.
Over three decades from 1959 to 1990, Lee as prime minister of Singapore, developed policies to improve living standards and education levels, ensure security and stability, and attract investment.1 He remained in service to the country until he passed away in 2015 at the age of 91.
Dodging a bullet
Lee was an academically gifted student who attended Raffles Institution and won a scholarship to study at Raffles College.2 His time at the college, however, was disrupted when the Japanese Army came a-knocking in 1942.3
Like many other Chinese males in Singapore, Lee was in danger of being rounded up for ‘Operation Sook Ching’ — a massacre where members of the Kempeitai or Japanese military police mercilessly executed people they believed to be anti-Japanese.4
While out with his family’s go-to rickshaw driver, Koh Teong Koo,5 they encountered Japanese soldiers who ordered them to report to a screening exercise. Understanding the gravity of the situation, the men resorted to quick tactical thinking to stay alive – a friend of Koh’s had a residence at 75 Maude Road located within the registration centre’s boundaries. The pair thus hid in the house until Lee found an opportune time to slip away following a change of guard.6
Lee’s political awakening
While studying at the London School of Economics and Cambridge University, Lee got involved with the British Labour Party and the anti-colonial Malayan Forum.8 This experience deepened his interest in politics and reinforced his belief that the way forward for Singapore was independence – not subservience. Interacting with fellow patriots and members of the forum such as Goh Keng Swee and Toh Chin Chye further spurred Lee’s eventual foray into politics.9
A secret wedding
Lee received a first-class law degree in 1949 and was called to the bar at London’s Middle Temple in 1950. Apart from academics, he also made time for romance, pursuing Kwa, a Queen’s Scholar. The pair married in secret in December 1947 in Stratford, England.10

The reason behind their discretion? Few parents and scholarship boards of the 1940s were open to the idea of marriage before graduation.11
Both husband and wife were eventually called to the bar in Singapore on 7 August 1951.12
Fighting for the rights of locals
Lee, who began his law career with the firm Laycock and Ong, became politically engaged in a variety of causes. Among other things, he advised trade unions and clan associations on legal matters, and even fought tooth and nail for local civil servants to receive the same benefits as their European counterparts.13
His efforts caught the eye of members of the public who viewed him as the voice of the people.14
In 1959, Lee – having set up law firm Lee & Lee with his wife and brother four years before – decided to leave the field and plunge himself full-time into politics.15

Carving a nation out of a colony
In 1954, Lee gathered a team of passionate patriots and gamechangers such as Goh and Toh for a series of clandestine meetings to discuss the nation’s future.16 On 21 November that year, Singapore’s first independent government was established.
The newly-formed party went on to contest in the 1955 Legislative Assembly elections, their relatable personalities and fiery speeches winning the hearts of locals. Lee himself was elected to represent the constituency of Tanjong Pagar,17 a position he maintained for 60 years until his death in 2015.18
A powerful orator, Lee’s rousing speeches and persuasive debating style subsequently led him and the PAP to a strong victory in the 1959 elections where his party captured 43 of the 51 available assembly seats. Lee, at the rather tender age of 35, became the prime minister of the self-governing state of Singapore.19
Merger with Malaya
From the outset, Lee believed that Singapore needed a hinterland or a larger country to lean on for natural resources and economic stability. This, as well as other concerns, led him to propose and push for a controversial merger with Malaya.20

Lee, however, faced multiple challenges along the way.
For instance, some within the PAP were unable to accept his idea. This led to members breaking away to form their own political party, the Barisan Sosialis (Socialist Front) in 1961.21
Lee nonetheless plowed ahead, working out and negotiating a merger deal for Singapore. After a referendum in 1962,22 Singapore merged with Malaya on 16 September 1963, leading to the birth of Malaysia.23
The arrangement did not go down smoothly. In fact, the merger was marked by bouts of violence and riots.24 Among them, the Communal Riots of 1964 where Malays and Chinese clashed. On paper, the merger sought to bring the land masses together, on the ground however, communities were being ripped apart at their seams.25
The merger also resulted in rather intense friction between the leaders of both territories. On 9 August 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia.26 In a televised press conference the same day, Lee shed tears in what came to be known as his moment of anguish.
Merdeka! Merdeka!
Singapore’s transition from merger to independence or merdeka in Malay, was relatively smooth as a result of careful planning on the part of Lee and his handpicked team.
Lee was also generally cautious about who he picked to serve in ministerial capacities. Based on their strengths, he placed Goh in charge of defence27, S. Rajaratnam on foreign affairs28, and Ong Pang Boon on education matters.29

Some of his wins included successfully locking down Singapore’s long term supply of water from Malaysia,30 and transforming the republic into a lush, garden city through islandwide tree-planting efforts.31
Along the way, Lee set aside liberal experiments, prioritising growth, safety, security and equality instead.32

From as early as the 1970s, Lee began planning for the future government of Singapore by recruiting and grooming new talent. In 1990, Lee stepped down as prime minister, nominating Goh Chok Tong to take his place.33

The nation is his legacy
Lee’s work for the country has been commemorated through various tributes, such as the establishment of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in 2004, and the creation of the Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship by the Public Service Commission.
For his contributions, Lee has been commemorated in various ways. For instance, the Public Service Commission’s Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship was set up in 1991.35 In 2004, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy was established.36
Lee Kuan Yew passed away at 3:18 am on 23 March 2015 at the age of 91.37 A week of national mourning and a state funeral was held.38 His legacy – a sovereign nation that was safe, prosperous, and stable, and where millions continue to call home – Singapore.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
The story of museums in Singapore begins with the Raffles Museum. Initiated by Raffles himself in 1823, and established in 1874 as part of a joint Raffles Library and Museum before it moved to its present Stamford Road premises in 1887, its purpose was to acquire specimens from and undertake research into Peninsular Malaya’s wealth of natural history, ethnology, and archaeology. The British believed that knowledge was power. As such, the establishment of a museum to document and research colonial territory was part and parcel of the British colonial effort, and a physical symbol of British sovereignty over alien lands. The museum’s predecessors included the Indian Museum in Calcutta and today’s National Museum of Indonesia, established by the Dutch, but briefly under Raffles’ supervision during an interregnum from 1811 to 1815 when Java was ruled by the British.

The Raffles Museum lost both its original purpose of being the collecting institution of the colonial apparatus and its collecting hinterland of Peninsular Malaya after Singapore attained self-government in 1959. Renamed the National Museum a year later, in 1960, it continued to flounder for the next few decades; critical questions as to what its role would be in the new nation were never satisfactorily answered. Management of the museum shifted from the Ministry of Culture to the Ministry of Science and Technology, and back again in 1972. With the latter shift, its natural history collections were excised and transferred to a brand new Singapore Science Centre and to the then-university of Singapore, where they still remain today and form the basis of the new Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. In place of its natural history displays, the National Museum introduced a new gallery dedicated to art from Singapore and the region.

It was not until the mid-1980s that the Government finally decided that it was necessary to address the National Museum’s long-term role in Singapore. A high-level Task Force on the Long-term Development of the Museum (also known as the Museum Development Committee, or MDC) was appointed by the Government to look into this. Almost concurrently, a larger Advisory Council for Culture and the Arts (ACCA) was initiated by then-Second Deputy Prime Minister, the late Dr Ong Teng Cheong. The ACCA’s mission was to review Singapore’s entire cultural landscape, and to propose a comprehensive strategy that would boost the island’s cultural vibrancy and preserve its heritage. Dr Ong wanted to turn around popular notions that Singapore was a “cultural desert”.
The recommendations of the MDC were eventually packaged as part of the slate of recommendations announced by the ACCA in 1989. Chief among the recommendations was a proposal to split the museum into five major standalone galleries: a Fine Arts Gallery, a Southeast Asian Natural History/Ethnology Gallery, a Singapore History Gallery, a Community Gallery, and a Children’s Museum. These galleries would be located in a “National Museum Precinct” centred around Fort Canning Hill and Bras Basah.
The motivation behind this proposal was the recognition that it was vital for Singapore’s continued economic success to engender in Singaporeans a deep understanding of the cultures and ways of living in the Southeast Asian region and in Singapore. Singapore’s increasingly cosmopolitan nature also made critical a deeper historical, cultural, and sociological exploration of Singapore society and identity. Moreover, the committee agreed that the existing museum premises were not large enough to accommodate works for all the new galleries, and that there was a need to expand significantly.
The recommendations of the ACCA were collectively implemented in the 1990s, first with the renaming of the National Museum as the Singapore History Museum in 1993. Subsequently, the Singapore Art Museum was established in 1996, at the former Saint Joseph’s Institution campus and so was the first wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum, in 1997 at the former Tao Nan School. Two other major developments took place during the same period — the first was the merging of the National Museum, the National Archives, and the Oral History Centre into the National Heritage Board (NHB) in 1993, charged to oversee the implementation of recommendations made by the ACCA pertaining to museums and cultural heritage. The second was the formation of the Museum Roundtable three years later, in 1996 — a loose association, or “coming together” of existing museums and public art galleries in Singapore. Today, the Museum Roundtable has grown organically to more than 50 members, including the National Museums, and other popular and established museums, such as the National University of Singapore Museum, the Science Centre, the Singapore Discovery Centre, the Changi Chapel and Museum, and the recently opened Art Science Museum at Marina Bay Sands.
The millennial decade saw an adrenaline-fuelled flurry of new developments in the museum landscape because of the Renaissance City Masterplans, which led to an emergence of a “business of museums”. This change was characterised by two paradigm shifts: the first was a recognition that museums — and the arts — were critical to urban vibrancy and quality of life, and thus an asset Singapore had to invest in in order to attract new businesses and talent; the second was to recognise museums as an industry in its own right, requiring strategies for the development of specialised capabilities such as curatorship, audience development, and object conservation.
There was a level of activity in the museum landscape never before seen — within the space of 10 years between 2000 to 2009, no less than 12 major museum-related milestones were achieved. These included the establishment of the Peranakan Museum, 8Q at Singapore Art Museum, and the Heritage Conservation Centre; the re-opening of the revamped National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum at Empress Place; the announcements of the proposed new National Gallery of Singapore and Indian Heritage Centre; the inaugural Singapore Biennale and Singapore Night Festival; and finally, Singapore’s participation for the first time in the prestigious Venice Biennale.
The Heritage Conservation Centre opened in 2000
The Peranakan Museum opened in 2008
Every year during this 10-year period, Singaporeans were treated to two to three high-profile “blockbuster” exhibitions imported from major international museums including the British Museum, the Vatican Museum, the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City, and the Musée du Louvre in Paris; or exhibitions that featured major artists and prestigious private collections in Singapore and the region. These exhibitions included China Art NOW! at the Singapore Art Museum in 2001, Journey of Faith: Art & History from the Vatican Collections at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2005, Greek Masterpieces from the Louvre at the National Museum of Singapore in 2008 and The Kangxi Emperor, Treasures from the Forbidden City at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2009. These blockbusters were often accompanied by two to three smaller, “boutique” exhibitions that presented Singaporean art, history, and popular culture, and explored Singapore’s role as a crossroads of art, cultures, and ideas across Asia. One such example was the Beauty in Asia exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum in 2009, which saw the museum taking on Asia in its entirety through the medium of a single question: “What is Beauty?”. These efforts to partner regional and international counterparts as well as explore Singapore’s own culture and heritage established the museums as destinations in their own right — visitorship to the National Museums went from a few hundred thousand in the early 2000s to more than 2 million annually by the end of the decade. Total visitorship to museums in the Museum Roundtable went past the 8-million mark by the 2010s.

Looking ahead, the future looks rosy for museums in Singapore. In 2013, entry to National Museums was made free for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, resulting in museum visitorship figures crossing the 3-million mark that year. 2014 saw major gifts amounting to over $50 million in cash and in-kind sponsorship to the National Gallery of Singapore, as well as $46 million raised for the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Finally, 2015 had four new museums opening — the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, the Indian Heritage Centre, the privately-run Singapore Pinacothèque de Paris, and the long-awaited National Gallery of Singapore. Concurrently, the National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum were also undergoing major gallery revamps and re-opened their doors at the end of the year. In the meantime, the Singapore Botanic Gardens had also just been successfully inscribed as Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site. All in all, there will be very vibrant and rich cultural heritage experiences for the general public in the years to come.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Rosalind-Tan-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"When Rosalind Tan was growing up, her mother would speak to her and the rest of the family, only in Malay. Baba Malay to be exact.
This baffled her. She looked Chinese, had Chinese ancestry but did not have a Chinese name.That simple act fuelled an interest in her origins.
Rosalind is Peranakan Chinese. “I come from an ethnic culture that not many people know about. Most people take it that you're half Malay and half Chinese, period. That's the most that they know,” she says.
She would learn that her ancestors, who were from China, arrived in the Straits of Malacca in the 19th century and married local women.
Religion was not on the forefront of these women's minds. They were more concerned about basic needs such as food, shelter and clothing — so they took on the religion of their husbands. As a result, Peranakan Chinese are not Muslims, and pork is a regular feature in their cuisine.
Her roots were very much alive at home. Rosalind 's mother came from Malacca, had Hokkien roots but spoke only Baba Malay, while her father was ethnically Chinese. His first wife only bore him two daughters after twelve years of marriage. Because sons were valued in Peranakan culture, he decided to take on a second wife.
“'My father was an Anglophile - the “King’s Chinese” as they were referred to then. His children would take the names of English kings and queens. My mother bore him eight sons and six daughters.” adds Rosalind. “Going by her lineage, I am fifth-generation Peranakan. My children are sixth and my grandchildren are seventh.”
Starting early
Her passion for volunteering began in secondary school. Rosalind started a social service club, which regularly visited childrens’ and nursing homes.
She later fundraised for the National Council of Social Service and was awarded the Special Volunteer Award. She has also been an air stewardess, worked in hotel management and real estate.
Rosalind retired at age 55. At that point, volunteering seemed like a natural next step. The Peranakan Museum had opened that year, just as she was entertaining the idea of becoming a docent.
A visit to the museum sealed the deal. On display was an artefact: a Catholic altar with carvings of the phoenix and qilins.
“I nearly fainted. I saw an artefact that once belonged to my family. I recognised it because I had seen it from afar, from the main door (of the home of my father's first wife),” she recalls. “I couldn't believe it so I brought some family members there. And, they said yes, it's the one.”
Looking back, she reflects, “I believed that I could add value to the museum. Plus, I was looking to contribute to society in the space of arts and culture, and better still, in the promotion of an ethnic culture which even my own ethnic group don’t know much about.”
Rosalind started training to be a docent in 2009. A year later, she was appointed co-head, and her responsibilities included training new docents.
Reaching out
In 2010, Rosalind mooted the idea of tours for the elderly in Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese dialects and the Malay language at The Peranakan Museum.
Although there were requests for Mandarin tours at that time, she didn't speak the language, and wanted to present them with alternatives.
The tours were a hit. The museum would host a group of eight to ten seniors once every two months. As time went on, the tours were held twice a month.
Elderly visitors loved the mock-up of an old kitchen, which was on display at the museum, and often shared their own stories of earlier times. Those who lived on Pulau Ubin would share that they reared chicken and ducks for a living. To get running water, they needed to pay 50 cents for the installation of water pipes, said Rosalind.
Then, the Alzheimer's Disease Association (ADA) wanted to take persons with dementia to the museum, as part of their therapy. Collaborating with The Peranakan Museum, ADA conducted a typographical survey in 2011, to ensure that it would be a safe environment. The route needed to be wheelchair-friendly and bright.
Rosalind also visited the association's New Horizon Centres with other docents. They found out more about its programmes for persons with dementia, which included arts and craft. They then decided that their museum tours for ADA’s clients would include the porcelain and kebaya galleries, to draw connections to familiar colours and patterns. Elderly visitors were also served tea with red dates before tours, to put them at ease.
“We are not trained medical personnel, so we needed to be very sensitive to how they would react to a new place. I think being friendly, warm and approachable is very important,” Rosalind says.
New horizons
ADA tours have since expanded to the National Museum of Singapore, with the launching of “Memories Cafe” in 2018. Held on Saturdays for persons with dementia and their caregivers, they visit two galleries which touch on Singapore in the 1950s, after a meal at the “Food for Thought” cafe.
The 65-year-old especially enjoys giving private tours. She feels there is far too much to tell in a typical hour. “I'd like to think that I have added some value especially in disseminating information about this niche culture.”
“To me, it is a great honour and privilege, and because of that, it's a tremendous duty. I must ensure I do the right thing, provide the right information and teach the children right, because oral traditions are not in the history books,” sums up Rosalind.

When I was asked to write this article, I was told to focus on the natural history collection1 of the former Raffles Museum and how they showcase a different aspect of Singapore’s (and the region’s) heritage. At this point, I must confess that I am no specialist in the field of natural history or biodiversity. However, as a student of museology, I have taken the liberty of expanding my topic to include the roles of collectors – both institutional and individual – and how they have contributed in building the Raffles Library & Museum’s natural history collection.
Through archival notes and published materials, this article will share stories behind how some specimens were found, the key personalities involved in the collection and why they have collected these specimens. On a larger context, the article also looks into the history of collecting as a natural form of human activity and it will end by examining the importance of a natural history collection today.
From Cabinet of Curious to Natural History of Collection
During the Renaissance period that emerged in the early 16th century, there began to appear – initially in European courts – collections of a special type, known as kunstkammer or cabinet of curiosities. The term literally refers to a ‘cabinet’ or a room filled with various types of ‘curios’ (objects) whose categorical boundaries were yet to be defined. These collections included antiquities, works of art, scientific instruments, books, paintings, religious or historical relics, exotic items from faraway lands and particularly natural history specimens. The historian, Irmgard Musch has commented that the aim was to bring together – at least in representative form – the most complete collection possible of all things knowable and worth knowing, to record them and thus to make them easier to grasp2.
Famous owners of cabinets of curiosities included Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria, Munich (1528-1579); Flemish physician Samuel van Quiccheberg (1529-1567); Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria (1529- 1595); Grand Duke of Tuscany, Francesco I de’ Medici (1541-1587); Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II (1552-1612); Danish physician Ole Worm (1588-1655); and Dutch pharmacist Albertus Seba (1665- 1736). Most of their collections laid the foundation of European museums today. In assembling their collections, these men were actually following a trend of their time.
The Renaissance was also known as the age of discovery as several nations and peoples engaged in intensive explorations of the world. In each voyage, new geographical and scientific findings were made and the ideal cabinet of curiosities defined an attempt to produce an overall and encyclopaedic picture of this world, the cosmos. However, this cosmological view of the world began to lose importance after 1600. In the 17th and 18th centuries, cabinets of curiosities were replaced by more specialised collections often triggered by scholarly curiosity based on scientific ‘objective’ principles. The new aim was less to reflect, in representative samples, the whole cosmos than to cover comprehensively a chosen area of speciality. Through description, comparison and ordering of their pieces, collectors strove to reach an empirical and scientific understanding of nature. It was even considered as a duty of every educated person to watch and study the time in which he lives and to participate in collecting natural history specimens or objects from foreign material cultures.
From the 18th century onwards, Europeans were increasingly interested in nature and societies beyond the Western world. This led to the establishment of academic societies, such as the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (1778) and the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1784), whose activities included the study of natural history, people and their material cultures. These institutions often encouraged laymen to collect for the sake of science and to share their research and donate their collections.
By the mid 19th century, riding on the expansion of colonial empires, European and American collectors were making their way to Southeast Asia in search of exotic plants, animal specimens and ethnographic objects. Scientists, voyagers, entrepreneurs and amateur collectors played an important role in building the large natural history and ethnographic collections of museums around the world. There were motivations enough for collecting – whether to act as an intellectual stimulus, to satisfy an investigating spirit, or to display wealth and erudition. And of course, collections owned or donated to academic institutions also raised the social prestige of their owners. Natural history museums, which evolved from cabinets of curiosities, also played an important role in the emergence of biological and environmental studies.
The birth of the Raffles Library & Museum
To bring this long museological tradition into the local context, Singapore’s oldest museum owes its birth to an eminent British colonial administrator, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781-1826), who was also a passionate naturalist and collector of natural history specimens. Raffles’ interests in natural history are well known, culminating in his founding of the Zoological Society of London in 1826, from which arose the London Zoo. Before he set foot in Singapore, he pursued these interests during his career in Penang, Malacca, Java and Sumatra. His own scientific interests were largely zoological and later he collected all things Javanese.
Raffles’ History of Java (1817) is an amazing assortment of miscellaneous knowledge. Writing to his friend, Dr Thomas Horsfield, (1773 - 1859) an American physician and naturalist, he constantly mentioned his latest finds and informed Horsfield of the shipping of his collections back to London. He wrote:
""Among my baggage and collections sent home by the Borneo are a few cases of animals (not very important but some new) and two cases of insects belonging to Lady R. If you would occasionally look at the latter it may be useful & my friend Mr. Evans to whose care they are consigned will gladly transfer them to you if you will under-take the charge – there is also a case or two of snakes and 5 barrels of animals in spirit – none however important – one contains the Bornean Orang Ootan4...""
Raffles’ letters reveal that he was a man of omnivorous learning but had little time, with an 18th century faith that believed it is possible to learn everything4. It was he who, in 1823, proposed setting up a museum and library in Singapore as a repository for specimens deemed relevant to the flora, fauna and peoples of the region. In another letter to Dr. Horsfield, he mentioned that:
""I am at present engaged in founding an institution at Singapore for the cultivation of the Chinese, Siamese and Malayan languages & the moral & intellectual improvement of the natives, in which there will be separate department for scientific purposes including a professor of natural history – as patron and founder of this institution I shall have to form a committee or corporation in Europe & we shall then have the means of at all times collecting information regarding these countries – the particulars I will hereafter send you when they are printed – I am glad to see your botanical collections are so well arranged and that you so soon propose publishing5.""
Unfortunately, Raffles left Singapore the same year and it was not until 1849 that the institution – named in his honour – was established by the committee of the Singapore Institution (present-day Raffles Institution). After several relocations, the Raffles Library & Museum finally found a home at Stamford Road and was officially opened on 12 October 1887.

Collectors and Curators: Charting the Specimens of the Raffles Museum
The Raffles Library & Museum was established in a period when the rise of disciplines such as anthropology and archaeology coincided with the expansion of colonial empires. Natural history was still the dominant discipline and took centre stage in the Raffles Library & Museum (RLM). Until its renaming as the National Museum in 1969, the RLM had established itself as a well-known scientific institution with a particularly comprehensive zoological collection. Almost all its curators were specialists in natural history6. In contrast, most of the ethnological materials acquired in the early years of the museum were haphazardly acquired with sketchy records and little information on the objects.

In 1893, RLM curator Dr Karl Hanitsch (1860-1940) reported the need for more systematic collecting with clear objectives and accurate documentation, as these were evidently lacking at the time. However, due to various other complications such as limited funds, manpower and storage space, the museum continued to rely on ad hoc donations and purchases whenever the opportunity arose.
One of the earliest attempts to systematically collect objects was in September 1924. Then RLM director, Cecil Boden Kloss (1877-1949), along with his assistant, N. Smedleyand Dr. H.H. Karny, Assistant Entomologist of the Zoological Museum in Buitenzorg (present day Bogor) in Java, organised an expedition to the Mentawai islands off the west coast of Sumatra. The expedition included 12 ‘native’ assistants who did most of the work – catching insects, trapping animals and gathering samples of plants and seeds. Among them was a Malay plant collector from the Botanical Gardens in Singapore and a number of Karny’s assistants from Java. Together, they spent two months on the islands gathering over 1,500 specimens. Most of these were natural history specimens now housed now in the collections of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research at the National University of Singapore. Among the items collected were about 150 ethnological objects which eventually came to the Asian Civilisations Museum. This small but significant collection of objects remains largely intact today. The majority of the pieces collected are everyday items of local manufacture: hats, containers, tools and weapons.

The museum’s Annual Report (1926) mentions that three cases of ethnological objects gathered by the expedition were put on display in the galleries and at least 23 monographs were published on the natural history specimens gathered through the Bulletins of the Raf es Library & Museum. In his introduction to the Spolia Mentawiensia series, Kloss noted that the islands were not very pleasant collecting grounds7, describing them as mostly swamp with paths that were often impassable owing to oods. Moreover, in spite of systematic employment of quinine and other precautions, all the members of the party except himself contracted malaria. Kloss added that the expedition enjoyed the protection of a military escort although this was ‘happily largely unnecessary’.
Building a Regional Network
The Raffles Museum curators continued to build up the collection by organising expeditions around Southeast Asia – often jointly with staff from the Selangor Museum and Perak Museum.
Thus a large number of specimens were acquired and deposited at the Raffles Museum. The Raffles Museum also conducted specimen exchange programmes with other institutions in Malaya, Indonesia, England, America, the Netherlands and India. One of the most significant exchanges was arranged in 1926 by H. C. Robinson, then director of the Federated Malay States Museums. He sent the bird and mammal collections of the Selangor Museum in return for the Raffles Museum’s insect collection.
Aside from the staff’s tireless collecting activities, many individual collectors have also contributed to the museum’s collection. William Louis Abbott (1860-1936), a native of Philadelphia, was considered as one of America’s greatest naturalists. In 1899, Abbott commissioned the construction of a 65-foot schooner, The Terrapin, in Singapore. Over the next 10 years, he visited almost all of the Southeast Asia island groups on The Terrapin. After each expedition, Abbott would return to Singapore to have his collections shipped off to Washington, D.C. He donated over 6,000 objects to the Smithsonian Institution, most of which were zoological specimens. A small portion of his collection was donated to the Raffles Library & Museum. Many were collected in collaboration with Kloss. Today, most of Abbott’s zoological collection remains intact in the Smithsonian and the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR), Singapore. A group of proboscis monkeys from West Kalimantan, Indonesia and a Malaysian Giant Terrapin donated by Abbott in 1905 and 1907 respectively are still on display in the RMBR gallery. These specimens were borrowed in 2009 for display at Hunters & Collectors – the Origins of the Southeast Asian collection, a special exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum.

Another prominent individual who contributed to the Raffles Museum’s zoological collection was Tom Harrisson (1911-1976), a British polymath and then Director of Sarawak Museum from 1947-1966. His friendship with the then director of the Raffles Museum, Michael Tweedie, fostered many working opportunities between the two museums. It was recorded in the Raffles Museum’s Annual Report that he brought a large collection of over 900 bird skins from the Kelabit Plateau in the interior of Sarawak8. Both Harrisson and Tweedie made a preliminary examination of the collection and drafted a report on this. It is unknown, however, if this report was ever published.
Anonymous Assistants
There is another class of unsung heroes who helped to build the museum’s collection. They were usually local assistants hired by collectors during their expeditions. Using local assistants was extremely important for both institutional and individual collectors. They acted as guides to the unfamiliar terrains and as interpreters to language and cultural barriers. This fact is often undermined or even neglected in return for a more objective scientific report or a more romantic and adventurous account by collectors in those days. Tweedie made a gratuitous note with regards to hiring local assistants and their contribution in the museum work.
""When I arrived in Singapore in 1932 to fill the post of Assistant Curator, zoological collecting and taxonomy was the museum’s main activity, but its scope was limited. The retiring Director Cecil Boden Kloss and his successor F.N. Chasen interested themselves solely in mammals and birds. The Curator, N. Smedley, who retired at the same time as Boden Kloss, had concerned himself mainly with the museum’s collection of reptiles. Entomology was covered by H.M. Pendlebury at the museum at Kuala Lumpur. So I had care of the reptiles, the fish and all of the invertebrates.

The collectors on the staff were Ibans from Sarawak, intelligent, energetic men and born naturalists. They and I would go together sometimes on day excursions, sometimes camping for a week or more, and they were soon far more adept at finding centipedes, scorpions and the like than I was. Under their patient and sympathetic tuition my Malay vocabulary steadily progressed9.""
The encounters between the local assistants and collectors also included many interesting stories. In an expedition to the Batu Puteh and Ulu Batang Padang Mountains in Perak, Cecil Wray, a Pahang Resident of the State Council, reported of a strange creature that lurked the area. He wrote:
""Later on we again heard the Datoh exhorting the Sakeis to be vigilant during the night; we could not understand why, but on inquiry, were told that on this mountain lives a peculiar animal, which prowls about at night: the body is that of a rhinoceros, but it has the head of a tiger. We were particularly told if one should visit the camp not to look at it, for it always chased and tried to kill anyone who looked at it, whereas if no notice was taken it passed on quietly. The Penghulu assured us that lots of people had seen this curious beast and many had been chased.10""
A blend of Science and Artistic Skills
Collecting natural history specimens might appear to be fun and exciting on the surface but it has practical problems as well. Storage space and conservation matters are usually the main concerns when it comes to natural history collections even today. While fossils, seashells and bones were not subject to major decay, other natural specimens require complex conservation measures.
Curators and specialists had to have basic knowledge of other relevant disciplines such as medicine and taxidermy. Aside from publishing scientific reports, curators also published guidebooks to assist amateurs and special interests groups. Cecil Boden Kloss, himself a well-known taxidermist, wrote an instruction manual for preparing mammal skins11.
Publications formed a part of every natural history collection and also served as commentaries on them. Kloss understood the importance of publications and had hence started the Bulletins of the Raffles Museum, which provided access to specialised subject matter and enabled readers to debate and acknowledge the work produced by the museum curators. The Bulletins quickly became one of the premier scholarly journals in its time, publishing many important papers on Southeast Asian zoology. The illustrations in the Bulletins also served to supplement collection of natural specimens, closing any gaps and making up for any deficiencies with pictures. Illustrations of the specimens could act as a substitute or supplement for specimens that were difficult to preserve or only partially collected.
However, to produce an illustration of a specimen is not an easy task. Musch has commented that “when a collector or naturalist commissioned an artist to draw specimens of interests to him, and in a second stage even to transfer them onto a plate for the press, the plant or animal in question underwent considerable abstraction and distillation on its way to becoming a scientific illustration12.” Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill, Director of the Raffles Museum (1911-1963) was known to act as both naturalist and artist.
It is also interesting to note that he liked to make his own drawings in pen and ink, choosing not to rely on the Museum’s resident artist. He preferred to depict his subjects in black and white instead of colour for he noted that:
""[Colour illustrations] are pleasant to draw, but the blocks are expensive (for publishing), and they are frequently not as helpful as many beginners (bird watchers) imagine them to be. Black and white work places the emphasis on the arrangement of light and dark tones in the plumage. This is far more constant under varying climatic conditions than the colour itself13.""

We can see from Gibson-Hill’s illustrations that a specimen was regarded as a representative of its species and its appearance was systematised. In most natural history illustrations, individual traits not typical of the subject’s kind were minimised and the scientifically significant ones were accentuated. The elements important for human identification of the specimens are better rendered and considerably clearer in the picture than in the actual specimen itself. Musch commented that this pictorial abstraction technique applied by artists of natural history illustrations may also be understood as one way of taming the multifariousness of nature14.
The natural history collection enjoyed its prominence until 1969 where its fate took a sudden turn for the worse. The Raffles Museum was renamed the National Museum and new directions were set for the institution to cater for arts, history and anthropology. The natural history collection was moved out to the Singapore Science Centre and was later transferred to the University of Singapore’s Bukit Timah campus and the collection became known as the Zoological Reference Collection in 1972. However due to space constraints and bad storage conditions, some specimens were damaged and it took a tremendous effort by the curators to prevent more losses. In 1986, the collection finally got a permanent home in the Kent Ridge campus of the National University of Singapore. Two years later, the university decided that the time was ripe to establish a research centre for biodiversity and hence oversaw the birth of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research.
A Race Against Time: Preserving and Presenting Natural History Collections for the Future
Today, the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR), renamed the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (LCKNHM) on 1st April 2014, has well-representd collections of animals - some of which are among the best in the world. At the time of writing, the LCKNHM had around 566,500 specimens16. Most of these items are irreplaceable, priceless and historically significant specimens.
Among the museum’s mammal collection, the primates (a taxonomical group that includes monkeys and apes) which total 867 catalogued specimens are probably the best represented. The LCKNHM also has large collections of rats, squirrels and bats. The mammal collection had 315 species and around 15,000 specimens in 2010.
The LCKNHM is also one of the finest reference museums for Southeast Asian birds, with approximately 1,060 species and some 31,000 specimens in 2010, including a fine collection of eggs and nests. Even with legal constraints on bird collecting, a few good specimens are still donated from time to time by members of the public nowadays. These are usually casualties of the migratory season.
In 2010, there were about 70,000 specimens in the RMBR’s entomological collection. While many specimens are mounted on pins, others are preserved in vials of alcohol. Microscopic taxa like mites are mainly mounted on glass slides. All entomological specimens have been sorted according to their various taxonomic levels.
At an international level, despite of their ever-growing importance, natural history collections, like most other aspects of the museum world, are suffering from a serious decline in resources16. Along with the wider impacts of globalisation and economic inflation, most museums today are under serious budget constraints, inadequate funding, declining numbers of trained professionals and lack of young people who want to work in museums. It was reported that the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., lost 30 federal scientist positions in the last decade17.
The challenge of future museums lies on how these institutions manage to find ways of continuing to develop the research potential of their collections while learning how to live with reduced resources. In Owen’s report, Robert Gropp, a representative of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) commented that natural history collections are bleeding slowly. Many museums are losing staff positions due to cuts to their operating budget. Gropp predicts that slowly but surely they will lose resources until an administrator determine that it is best to close the facility18. These implications have resulted scientists and curators working in a museum in a race against time.
To make matters worse for natural history museums, the world is in the grip of a biodiversity crisis. Keith Thomson, an Emeritus Professor of Natural History at Oxford University, has warned that “as the whole ecosystems continue to be lost because of human activities, the need for natural history collections is more important than ever. These collections provide essential research in the biological sciences; serves as a vast library about what organisms have lived and are living on Earth; and contribute to public education in an easily accessible venue19.”
Research in biodiversity is of particular urgency. Professor Peter Ng, Director of the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, has remarked that “Southeast Asia is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, though it has received much less attention compared to the Amazon, West Africa and the Great Barrier Reef. But how can we protect the diversity of this region if we do not conduct the necessary research to understand it in the first place20?”
With natural history museums in Washington, New York and London drawing millions of visitors each year, there was demand from both the public and scientists of this region for a proper natural history museum in Singapore. Commentators and letter writers to the newspapers noted that the premises of the RMBR in 2010 did not allow it to realise its full potential in education and research21. The museum received tremendous public support since media reports highlighted its vast but little-known collection. This call for a new facility was heard from an undisclosed member of the public who pledged S$10 million for a natural history museum22. The plan to build a new natural history museum in Singapore was fulfilled with the building of the LCKNHM, a museum and research facility, which was opened to the public on April 18, 2015. It aims to be the focal point for regional biodiversity research and education and it is accessible to other universities, national agencies and nature lovers.
The modern museum is a constantly evolving entity. Julian Spalding, a former director of the Glasgow Museums, has observed that museums “will continue to have a duty to accumulate knowledge, but their authority will be based more in the future on their openness towards and commitment to learning, not on the weight of their knowledge to date23.” Given today’s technological advancement, anyone with access to the Internet can obtain or claim any required form of information. Hence, museums would have a better chance of captivating the attention of a wider audience if they used as their starting point the ignorance we have all shared, and must share. In other words, museums need to preserve the past not merely for nostalgic reasons.
Nostalgia is personal; it dies with each individual and generation. The past only merits preservation if it has something to teach the public of today. Museums are about learning through looking. Hence, it is the museum’s job to make its collections meaningful to audiences. Modern museums have to find more dynamic ways of integrating the public with the research functions of collections. Natural history collections do not just mirror the planet’s biodiversity – they help to sustain it. For many museum visitors, the countless rows of stuffed or pickled specimens on display in the galleries are a reminder of what’s at stake.
Selected timeline of the Raffles Library and Museum
1823 – Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Dr Robert Morrison (1782-1834) come up with the idea of a scientific institution devoted to the study of natural history and history of the islands of the Malay Archipelago. Raffles departs for Bencoolen (present day Bengkulu, Sumatra) on 9 June. Work plans for the scientific institution are handed over to a board of trustees to oversee the project.
1827 – The institution building, known as the Singapore Institution, is erected but stands vacant for eight years.
1837 – The school library begins to build its collection of books. The management committee contemplates the formation of a museum in connection with the library.
1849 – The museum slowly begins to take shape. The Library receives an official gift of two gold coins from the Temenggong of Johore, presented by Governor Colonel W.J. Butterworth, who supports the management committee in pressing for the establishment of a museum.
1850 – The management committee reports that the museum is a valuable addition to the library and gradually sees a series of official gifts from neighbouring government officials. The Straits Settlements government announces the museum’s participation in the Great Exhibition in London the following year.
1851 – The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations is held in London. It is the first in a series of World’s Fair exhibitions of culture and industry.
1873 – Singapore participates in the Permanent Exhibition of Colonial Products in South Kensington, UK. Formal paperwork is put through for the establishment of the Raffles Library and Museum.
1874 – The Raffles Library and Museum (RLM) opens its doors to the public. The first Annual Report of the RLM is published. Issues reported frequently over the next century are: lack of space, lack of proper accommodation and too much work for the curator-cum-librarian.
1881 – Growing interest from the public and scientific society at large towards the library and museum. Scientists passing through Singapore begin to visit the museum and zoological specimens are sent for identification by experts.
1882 – After several relocations, the RLM is shifted to the foot of Fort Canning at Stamford Road.
1887 – The museum is officially opened on 12 October 1887 by Frederick Weld, Governor of the Straits Settlements.
1895 – Entomologist Dr Karl Richard Hanitsch (directorship 1908–19) appointed Curator and Librarian of the RLM. His principal research is in entomology (the study of insects), but he also works on other natural history specimens such as sponges, birds, amphibians and mammals. A large part of his publication is on insects, in particularly, cockroaches. Hanitsch becomes director in 1908 and holds the position for eleven years. During his tenure, RLM’s zoological collection prospers from expeditions around the region. The ethnological collection is also enhanced by donations and acquisitions from Agricultural Trade Shows around the region. Before his retirement, Hanitsch starts a collection of portraits, plans and pictures of old Singapore to celebrate the centenary of the founding of Singapore by Raffles.
1902 – Valentine Knight joins as assistant curator and taxidermist for the zoological collection, a post he holds till 1921. He is responsible for many taxidermy masterpieces during his service.
1911 – Growing interest in the museum from the local communities. In 1908, the museum sees over 10,500 visitors over the two-day Chinese New Year holiday and by 1918, some 17,472 visitors pass through the galleries.
1919 – Entomologist John Coney Moultan (directorship 1919- 23) succeeds Dr Hanitsch as director. He was Curator of the Sarawak Museum (1909-15) and founding editor of the Sarawak Museum Journal. Moultan reorganises the natural history collection, giving the insect collection a proper display and reviews the chaotic and haphazardly arranged ethnological and archaeological collections. Moultan emphasises the museum’s educational role and plans a series of guides to the different sections of the zoological collections. He resigns in 1923 to become Chief Secretary to the Government of Sarawak.
1921 – Frederick Nutter Chasen appointed assistant curator to take over from the retiring Valentine Knight. Chasen has a strong interest in birds and museum work.
1923 – Zoologist Cecil Boden Kloss (directorship 1923–32) takes over directorship from Moultan. In the early 1900s, Kloss travelled with American naturalist William Louis Abbott to the Andaman and Nicobar islands. He also worked under Herbert C. Robinson, Director of the Federated Malay States Museums. Kloss and Chasen make a strong team: they established the museum’s zoological collection and boost the quality of research. Kloss retires in 1932, remembered as an ardent collector, skilful taxidermist, fine shot and a first class photographer.
1924 – Kloss and staff of RLM conduct the first systematic collecting expedition on material culture specimens from the Mentawai islands.
1928 – Kloss produces the Bulletin of the Raffles Museum. The first paper in the inaugural issue is written by Dr Hanitsch.
1930 – The museum’s popularity continues. More local residents seek information from a commercial or scientific point of view on the museum. 300,000 visitors come annually.
1932 – Frederick Nutter Chasen (directorship 1932–42) is the natural choice as Kloss’ successor. Chasen, the most reliable authority on Malaysian birds and mammals, authors more than 60 articles. He is also consulted regularly by every international expedition to the area. Sadly, he dies at sea attempting to flee Singapore on the eve of the Japanese invasion. Michael Wilmer Forbes Tweedie joins as assistant curator (1932–41) He was interned during the Japanese Occupation.
1935 – RLM receives three grants from the Carnegie Foundation, which are used to refurbish the museum galleries and cabinets, produce new research publications, fund more fieldwork and archaeological expeditions and employ additional staff. H.D. Collings joins to assist with the non-zoological collection. He has practical training in archaeology and experience in excavating prehistoric sites in Europe.
1942 – During the Japanese Occupation, RLM is headed by Professor Hidezo Tanakadate, a volcanologist, and a handful of British scientists, who work with the Japanese to protect the research integrity and collection of the library and museum. Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill joins on the eve of the Japanese attack and is present when Professor Tanakadate enters the museum. He is interned together with other museum staff.
1945 – World War II ends. The museum is handed over to Gilbert Archer, Officer-in-charge of Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives of the British Military Administration. RLM was one of the few places not looted prior to the Japanese occupation.
1946 – Michael W.F. Tweedie (directorship 1946–57) takes over directorship from Gilbert Archer. His first challenge is to rebuild the building and reorganise some of the much neglected museum collections. The zoological and anthropological galleries are rearranged to focus on materials from the Malay Peninsula. Tweedie also recognises the need for greater specialisation of curators and the increased importance of the ethnographic collections. He creates the positions of ‘Curator of Anthropology’ and ‘Curator of Zoology’. Tweedie also conducts many expeditions around Southeast Asia. H.D. Collings is appointed Curator of Anthropology and C.A. Gibson-Hill Curator of Zoology.
1957 – Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill (directorship 1957–63) is appointed director. The last expatriate director of the Raffles Museum, Gibson-Hill is a medical doctor by training and a self-taught ornithologist and photographer. A keen naturalist and dedicated scientist, Gibson-Hill’s scholarship soon embraces Malaysian history and archaeology as well. He is found dead in his home in Singapore just before he is to relinquish the post of director in 1963. Graduates of the University of Malaya – Eric Alfred and Christopher Hooi – join as Curator of Zoology and Curator of Anthropology respectively.
1960 – The museum and library split with the latter forming the National Library adjacent to the museum building. In 2005 the National Library is relocated to Victoria Street. The museum is renamed the Raffles Museum.
1965 –The Republic of Singapore is born.
1969 – Raffles Museum is formally renamed the National Museum in the interest of emphasising a sense of national identity.
1972 – The zoological collection is transferred out of the National Museum and subsequently shifted to several locations before it comes to rest at the National University of Singapore.
1993 – The national collection is devolved to start new national museums; the Asian Civilisations Museum inherits the ethnology collection; the Singapore Art Museum inherits the national art collection; and the Singapore History Museum (now known as the National Museum of Singapore) inherits the historical material collection showing evidence of Singapore’s pre-modern, colonial and post-Independence past.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2014
Singapore prides itself on its multicultural society and the resultant cultural diversity that such a multi-ethnic social landscape produces. Nonetheless, historical official categories of ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ in singapore have tended to gloss over the rich heritage and cultural practices unique to sub-ethnic groups within the larger ethnic ‘wholes’. Hence ethnic categories such as ‘Chinese’, ‘Malay’ and ‘Indian’ may only scratch the surface of cultural communities that are in fact far more complex, with myriad histories and customs, despite some shared religious practices and languages.
In that respect ‘Malay’ sometimes becomes a convenient administrative ‘shorthand’ – a catch-all term that belies the various origins and social histories of the Malayo-Polynesian communities of Southeast Asia, communities which include diverse groups such as the Baweanese, the Javanese, the Minang, the Bugis, the Banjarese and the Mandailings. For centuries, these peoples voyaged back and forth across what historian Leonard Andaya has termed the ‘Sea of Melayu’ and many of them, especially the Baweanese, came to settle in Singapore during the period of European colonialism in the 19th-20th centuries.
On 15 March 2014, the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC) launched its first-ever community co-curated exhibition, LaaobeChanging Times: Baweanese Heritage & Culture in Singapore (Laaobe: Warisan & Budaya Bawean di Singapura). The exhibition, which featured the Baweanese community in Singapore, also marked the launch of the Se-Nusantara series. This is another exhibition put up annually that features a different sub-ethnic group of the Malays in Singapore. Each partner sub-ethnic cultural group will get to work together with MHC’s curatorial experts to showcase their unique cultures and tell their diasporic histories of merantau (voyaging) across Southeast Asia, and how they ultimately came to compose the mosaic of Malay identities in Singapore.
Laaobe highlighted the Baweanese community in Singapore, whose forefathers hailed from Pulau Bawean, a small island located off the northeastern coast of Java. Laaobe, which means “changed”, showcased the heritage and transformation of the local Baweanese community over the years, as shaped through various historical and socio-economic events.
The exhibition presented the history and development of Singapore’s Baweanese people through over 40 objects and archival materials contributed by the community. Exhibits included rarely-seen personal collections of pictures of ponthuk life and daily objects found in Baweanese households, such as handwoven pandan mats and bags, and a high-footed bed frame popular with Malay families in the past.
Who are the Baweanese?
Narratives of diasporic communities usually revolve around several themes and milestones in their journey and experiences in their new homeland. They usually elaborate on the reasons the Baweans migrated to Singapore, factors that contributed to their migration patterns, and the impact of their migration on Singapore’s cultural landscape. The exhibition sought to provide an insight to these topics and introduce both local and foreign visitors to the MHC to the vibrant Baweanese community in Singapore. The Baweanese originated from a small island called Pulau Bawean, which is located off the northeastern coast of Java in modern-day Indonesia. The inhabitants call themselves ‘orang Phebiyen’ or ‘orang Bawean’, speak ‘Baweanese’ and profess Islam as their faith. Here, they are more familiarly known as Orang Boyan (‘Bawean people’, although ‘Boyan’ is a mispronunciation of ‘Bawean’).

Merantau and the Malay Diaspora in Souteast Asia
Merantau, the Baweanese cultural practice of temporarily migrating to distant lands in search of work opportunities and to better oneself, was one of the key factors that led to scores of young Baweanese men leaving their ancestral desa (villages) in search of their fate and fortunes. The majority did not have the intention to settle down permanently in the countries they visited. Their main motive was to make sufficient money to buy gold and other consumer goods, and ultimately to build a house in Bawean when they returned.
The Baweanese started migrating to Singapore in the 19th century and this movement further intensified in the early 20th century due to the vast economic opportunities available here. Colonial records show that Baweanese migrants were a formal ethnic category of Singapore’s population in 1849, but given the active maritime movements criss-crossing Southeast Asia, it is highly likely that Baweans were already part of Singapore’s social milieu as early as the turn of the 19th century. These early settlers provided much-needed services in the port areas, town centres and even recreational arenas. At the time, Bawean men were known for their horse-handling and motoring skills and many worked as horse syces, drivers and water-boat workers. Even though many of these Baweanese saw themselves as sojourners, most of them settled permanently due to the higher wages they could earn here as well as the increasingly restrictive colonial policies that prevented them from easily returning to Bawean.
Ponthuk Living
The Baweanese community of Singapore grew out of successive waves of migrants settling permanently here from the mid-19th century onwards. Many Baweanese settled at the bank of the Rochor River between Jalan Besar and Syed Alwi Road. Pre-war shophouses located around Kampong Kapor Road near Jalan Besar were turned into ponthuks, such as Pondok Diponggo, Pondok Kalompang Gubuk and Pondok Gelam.

The ponthuk (Malay: pondok), a communal residence based on village affiliations back on Bawean, became an important social institution for the Baweanese community in Singapore until the end of the 20th century. These ponthuks, in effect shophouse residences set in urban locations around Singapore, initially served as temporary homes for the Baweanese newcomers and provided them with safety and other welfare services – a practice similar to the kongsi concept of Chinese clans. A newcomer lodged in the ponthuk until he had found employment and a permanent home usually provided by his employer.
As more Baweanese came to settle in Singapore and married locals or brought over their families, the ponthuk came to grow as a social institution that ensured the communal welfare of the Baweanese until they were financially able to set up their own home. It served not only as an institution that gave them a sense of socio-economic security but was also a micro-economic reflection of village relationships back on Bawean.

One of the highlights of the Laaobe exhibition was the depiction of life in a ponthuk during the mid-19th to late 20th century and the vivid presentation of community-contributed artefacts. The ponthuk representation gave visitors an insight into the living conditions of the Baweanese settlers and the communal activities that contributed to the beginnings of a community group known for being close-knit.
A Pak Lurah or residence master would head each ponthuk and serve as the leader of that household. The Baweanese are known for making group decisions by consensus, and general assemblies and other meetings usually took place in the living room of a ponthuk. Generally, this area was restricted to male ponthuk residents and guests only. A typical living room in a ponthuk had a huge multi-purpose ambin (a low raised platform) and a communal dining table. The ambin, which usually covered one-third of the floor area, served several purposes – it could be used as a huge yet spartan bed for ponthuk bachelors, for daily solat (prayers) or even as a place where Qur’an recitations were performed.

Baweanese cultural norms and practices
Living in a close-knit ponthuk environment contributed to the formulation of cultural norms and practices within the Baweanese community in Singapore. These cultural norms, which are ill- practised today, include the concept of gotong-royong, or ‘mutual aid’. Gotong-royong is a shared cultural value across the different Malay communities and the spirit of ‘mutual aid’ was embodied in ponthuk life. Ponthuk residents were expected to assist one another in good and bad times, and contribute financially to the household. Weddings, thanks-giving customs, newborn baby celebrations and funerals were affairs that concerned the entire ponthuk community. Ponthuk living also contributed to the formation of social groups such as the kendarat (a voluntary service during wedding occasions), kompang (a handheld drum ensemble), berzanji (a religious recitation group) and kercengan, a quintessential traditional Baweanese group performance that blends Quranic verses and Baweanese chorale music.

Persatuan Bawean Singapura (PBS)
Laaobe was produced in partnership with Persatuan Bawean Singapura (PBS - Singapore Baweanese Association), a social organisation formed in 1934 to assist and supervise all the ponthuks scattered all over the island at that time. Back then, PBS worked closely with the various ponthuks to help Singapore’s newly arrived Baweanese migrants by providing shelter and sustenance as well as aid to secure employment.
After 1962, ponthuks started closing down as families began to move out into single-family residences. Although the ponthuk has disappeared from Singapore’s urban landscape, PBS continues to play an important role in the context of Singapore’s multi-ethnic cultural milieu by promoting the language and culture of the Baweanese community. The group also organises charity and community events nationally that involve the larger multi-ethnic Singapore community.

The Baweanese Community in Singapore today
The Baweanese today no longer live in ponthuks, but that has not diminished the community spirit of the people. The Baweanese word “laaobe” means “changed” and while transformation aptly describes the history of the Singapore Baweanese community over the decades, many aspects of Baweanese culture, heritage and values are still very much alive today.
The many programmes supporting the exhibition were also opportunities for both Singaporean and foreign visitors to learn more about the Baweanese culture as well as its delicious cuisine, and about how the community has enriched the extraordinary cultural landscape that we enjoy in Singapore.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 – Jul to Sep 2015
Singapore’s first stand-alone natural history museum finally opened its doors to the public on April 18, 2015 and members of the public warmly welcomed the latest member of our museum and heritage scene. Quintessentially a people’s museum, it was supported by a grounds-up fundraising initiative that generated donations from foundations, corporations, and thousands of members of the public.
While the museum is new, the inspiration for its establishment can be traced all the way back to Sir Stamford Raffles himself. Over the years, many have pushed for the idea of a stand-alone natural history museum in Singapore; in 2005, Professor Tommy Koh, Singapore’s Ambassador-at-Large and Honorary Chairman of National Heritage Board, formally proposed the idea. However, due to a lack of funding, the project never materialised. It was only in 2009, after a group of anonymous donors came forward with seed funding, that the idea took root.
Over a weekend in May hosting 2009’s International Museum day, the collection which was then housed in the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR) at the National University of Singapore, saw over 3,000 visitors — more than what RMBR would see in a year! This keen interest, along with awareness raised by articles in The Straits Times surrounding the idea of a museum, followed a string of donations from the public which amounted to almost $1 million, $25 million from the Lee Foundation, along with the original seed funding given by the group of anonymous donors, which allowed the project to progress. It was because of the interest and generosity of the public that LKCNHM stands as it does today.
A secretary gave a month of her salary; a retired technician at the NUS Biological sciences department gave another $20,000. The museum’s centrepieces — Prince, Apollonia and Twinky, a trio of among the largest creatures to roam the earth about 150 million years ago — would not be around had Della Lee, wife of Lee Foundation chairman Lee Seng Gee, not generously donated $25 million to the cause. Another signature piece, a 200-year-old narwhal tusk, was donated by the family of late businessman “Whampoa” Hoo Ak Kay, one of Singapore’s pioneers of the 1800s. The tusk was given to Whampoa by the Russian government in the 1860s as a gift, as he represented them as consul in Singapore.
Both a museum and a research facility, LKCNHM strives to be a leader in Southeast Asian biodiversity — in research, education and outreach. The public gallery consists of over 2,000 specimens categorised across 15 different zones. These include the Cabinets of Curiosity zone, which showcases many iconic specimens from our native soil and Singapore Today, a showcase of our island’s geology and important conservation work being done by national agencies. The impressive collection of natural specimens and artefacts tells the story of our island nation.
This precious gem of an institution stands as testament to the role we, as seemingly ordinary citizens, have in shaping and preserving Singapore’s heritage story.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/still-standing/story,"Singapore is all gleaming spires and sleek edifices today, but back in the day when these were rarer, she achieved a different type of architectural feat. Post-colonial Singapore had various architectural styles represented in her skyline which were telling of the nation’s turbulent past, but most of them have since given way to the towering skyscrapers that came with our economic advancement.
Of the buildings of yesteryear, some have been demolished, others, refurbished – and they continue to stand proud today amongst the steely façades of newer glass monoliths. Some of these structures include the Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall, Old Supreme Court, and CHIJMES.

Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall did not start off as a theatre when it was completed in 1862. Initially built as a Town Hall with an accompanying theatre, it soon became too small to serve its dual function of housing a venue for local dramas and operas, as well as a space for government agencies and the Singapore Library.
Following the passing of Queen Victoria in 1901, a public meeting was held in the Town Hall to pass the resolution of building a memorial hall for the late queen on the land adjacent to the Town Hall building. Designed in Palladian style to reflect the Italian Renaissance, it opened in 1905 and was later accompanied by a newly refurbished Town Hall that now served as a municipal theatre – the Victoria Theatre. In an effort to unify the appearances of both buildings, a clock tower was built between them, and a portico was duplicated on the Town Hall building to mirror that of the New Memorial Hall.
Over the years, the Victoria Memorial Hall has played an important role in Singapore’s political landscape. In the midst of World War II, it served as a hospital; at the end of the war, it saw the trials of Japanese war criminals; and in 1954, the newly formed People’s Action Party (PAP) used it for their inaugural meeting. Between the years of 1952 to 1979, the building underwent major renovations to restructure its interiors and increase seating capacity. Accompanying its new appearance was also a new name: Victoria Concert Hall. In 2010, the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall closed for major renovations costing $158-million and reopened in 2015, fully operational.

Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) was a girls' school established at Victoria Street in 1854 by French Catholic nuns. It underwent extensive restoration works and reopened again in 1996 as CHIJMES | c. 1904 – 1910 | Lim Kheng Chye Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore
The origins of CHIJMES hark back to an older era where it started out as the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ), a Catholic school for girls. Established in 1854 by an order of French Catholic nuns, the site was initially only home to the Caldwell House building which was designed by renowned colonial architect, George Coleman. When the property was bought over, the surrounding parcels of land were also acquired with the intention of building a girls’ school. The four-acre precinct soon came to include English-language primary and secondary schools, Chinese-medium school St Nicholas Girls, an orphanage, the nuns’ quarters and a chapel.
By 1983, the primary and secondary school relocated to new premises in Toa Payoh and the remaining site was redeveloped and partitioned to house the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) headquarters. Of the longstanding complex, the Caldwell House, chapel and orphanage building remain – today, a plaza of nightlife spots and retail shops. Amongst the five Neo-Classical buildings, the chapel – now known as CHIJMES Hall – remains the centrepiece. The Gothic chapel features intricate 19th century stained-glass windows made in Bruges, Belgium that depicts scenes from the Bible. Below arched cross-vaulted ceilings, wooden pews imported from Toulouse, France, sit on colourful terrazzo tiles. The building’s exterior, with its flying buttresses, elaborate Corinthian columns, and five storey Gothic-style steeple, is an impressive sight. Also adding to the different aesthetics of the self-contained city block, is the 176-year-old Caldwell House that emphasizes Ionic columns and sweeping courtyards with cobblestone floors and fountains.

Queenstown, also known to some as the queen of estates,1 was initiated by the British in 1952 as Singapore’s first satellite town.2
A satellite town is essentially a self-sufficient housing estate located outside the city centre with its own amenities, schools, shops, markets, cinemas, and places of worship.3
This public housing model, with satellite towns better known as the heartlands today, has since been replicated across the island.4

Singapore's first public housing skyscraper
The ambitious plan to build Queenstown was undertaken by the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT). Naming it after Queen Elizabeth II to mark her coronation,5 the SIT set out to construct five estates – the Princess Estate, Duchess Estate, Tanglin Halt, Commonwealth,6 as well as Queen’s Close and Queen’s Crescent.7
When the Housing Development Board took over its development in 1960, it added the neighbourhoods of Mei Ling and Buona Vista.8
The former Buller Camp,9 as well as Boh Beh Kang village’s swamps, cemeteries and farmland, were among the first areas the SIT built over.10
The SIT’s Forfar House, with its pleasant curves and modern sanitation system, was 14 storeys tall and comprised 106 flats. (c1956. Image from the National Archives of Singapore)
Among the new structures heralding a new era of public housing was the 14-storey Forfar House at Queenstown11 – the first ever public housing skyscraper to grace Singapore’s skyline.12 Featuring undulating curves across its facade, the structure had been solidly constructed to withstand wind pressure. Its various residential units were also among the first in Singapore to be equipped with modern toilets and built-in rubbish chutes,13 modern conveniences for its occupants who used to live in village huts.14 The 1956 landmark was demolished and replaced in the 2000s,15 by the even taller 40-storey Forfar Heights’ residences.16

Crown jewels
Among the other standout structures to rise in Queenstown was Alexandra Road’s red-bricked Princess House which was designed to host offices and community facilities.18 Its occupants included the SIT, the HDB which sited its headquarters there in 1960, 19 as well as the departments of Social Welfare and Licensing which were responsible for issuing hawker licenses as Singapore transitioned itinerant and street hawkers to purpose-built markets and food centres.20
Princess House was conserved in 2007 for its historical and social significance. 21

Commonwealth Avenue Wet Market, which opened on 23 October 1960, was has been well-loved by residents. It was one of the first wet markets to rise on the island22 and the last standing market in Singapore to have been designed by the SIT. 23 It was gazetted for conservation in 2013. 24

The town of many 'firsts'
Queenstown’s developments over the years reflect the country’s pioneering and innovative spirit,25 with the planning area playing host to many “firsts” on the public housing front.

For instance, it was where the first HDB flats in the form of Stirling Road’s blocks 45, 48, and 49 rose. Completed in 1961,26 they came in handy for displaced victims of the Bukit Ho Swee fire which occurred the same year.
Later, the first point blocks to have ever been built in Singapore were erected on Mei Ling Street. The units went on sale in April 1970.27
Adding finishing touches to the self-contained town, the HDB introduced amenities for learning, entertainment, health and sports.28 This resulted in the opening of Singapore’s first full-time branch library, the Queenstown Public Library;29 the first polyclinic, Queenstown Polyclinic; as well as the first ever neighbourhood sports complex, the Queenstown Sports Complex.30

Similar satellite towns were subsequently launched by the HDB across Singapore. These days, more than 80 per cent of the population live in HDB flats.31 Even so, Queenstown remains one of the most sought-after residential estates in Singapore,32 living up to its name as the queen of towns.

The Singapore flag could have been blue.1 It was one of several proposed designs that had been put forward by founding father Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye (10 December 1921 - 3 February 2012) and his committee.2 Eventually, another design – red and white with five stars and a crescent – was picked. Toh, who was the People’s Action Party’s (PAP) founding chairman, had been given the task of developing Singapore’s official symbols to reflect the values and identity of the newly-formed self-governing state.
Apart from the flag, Dr Toh also contributed to the design of the state crest3 and worked on the national anthem with composer Zubir Said4
A scholar shaped by hardship
Toh, born in Taiping, Perak on 10 December 1921, was academically inclined and managed to secure a scholarship to study at the prestigious Raffles College in Singapore.5
His studies, however, had to be put on hold during the Japanese Occupation (1942-1945). During the war, he eked out a living as a hawker assistant and grew potatoes and tapioca to survive.6 7 This experience gave him first-hand exposure to the hardships and suffering of the people of war-torn Singapore and shaped his political outlook and leanings.8
Toh eventually graduated from Raffles College in 1946 and went on to pursue a doctorate in physiology at the National Institute for Medical Research in London in 1949.9
Foray into political activism
While in London, Toh met Goh Keng Swee,10 who had co-founded an anti-colonial student group. Known as the Malayan Forum, members met regularly to discuss an independent trajectory for Singapore and Malaya.11 Toh, who shared the group’s ideals, joined them. Goh, who was due back in Singapore,12 later nominated Toh to take over his role as chairman.13
The founding of the PAP
Upon his return to Singapore, Toh participated in clandestine basement meetings at Lee Kuan Yew’s Oxley Road bungalow. Goh too was present. These meetings led to the establishment of the PAP on 21 November 1954,14 an open and legal political party seeking independence for Singapore.15 Toh has been credited for initiating the party’s formation.16

Monumental tasks ahead
With a capable and passionate team in his corner, Toh successfully ran for the position of Legislative Assemblyman for the constituency of Rochore in 1959.17 Soon after, he was tasked to head a committee to design the Singapore flag and state crest. There were many things to take into consideration at the time including the sentiments of neighbouring countries as well as Singapore’s multiracial population. After careful deliberation, Toh designed the flag and state crest to represent Singapore’s aspirations and its geographical significance.18
When Singapore needed its own national anthem, Toh was once again called upon. He was responsible for shortlisting Encik Zubir Said’s composition Majulah Singapore which had originally been written to commemorate the newly-renovated Victoria Theatre in 1958. Toh was instrumental in shaping the final cut of the song, suggesting, among other things, to shorten its length and tweak its melody for easy recall. The revised version was unveiled along with the state flag when Singapore gained independence in 1965.19 
Decades of selfless service
Toh served as Singapore’s deputy prime minister from 1959 to 1968, minister of science and technology from 1968 to 1975, and minister of health from 1975 to 1981.20 
Apart from his ministerial portfolios, Toh also took on the role of vice-chancellor from 1968 to 1975 at the National University of Singapore (NUS) where he introduced nationally-oriented reforms prioritising engineering and architecture in support of Singapore’s industrialisation efforts.21 
Toh also helped to centralise the university’s various campuses at Kent Ridge,22  and played an important part in setting up the National University Hospital (NUH).23

After stepping down from the cabinet in 1981, Toh continued serving in his role as member of parliament for Rochore for another seven years.24  An advocate for critical thinking, he became a vocal source of opposition to his own party, debating hot issues such as the Medisave Scheme, Central Provident Fund’s age withdrawal limit,25 as well as press freedom.26  
Toh received a number of distinctions and awards for his dedication to the nation. For his 29 years at Rochore’s helm, the Toh Chin Chye Benevolent Fund for the elderly was established. Toh was also awarded the Order of Nila Utama (First Class) for his contributions leading up to and after Singapore’s independence. Later, in 2001, the NUS launched the Toh Chin Chye Professorship in Molecular Biology.27

The national pledge is recited in schools across Singapore most mornings – a tradition upheld since 1966.1 The 38-word oath, largely written by wordsmith and former journalist Sinnathamby Rajaratnam (25 February 1915 – 22 February 2006),2 encapsulates the core values that form the bedrock of our nation. Apart from famously lending his expertise to the development of the pledge, Rajaratnam, who was one of the founding members of the People’s Action Party (PAP), is also known for his dedication to the nation, having held down numerous portfolios during his long political career.3
Journalist turned politician
Born in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, Rajaratnam was just six months old when he was brought to Seremban, Malaya to join his father, a supervisor at a rubber plantation.
An avid reader, he studied at Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur and Raffles Institution in Singapore. Later, he pursued law at King’s College in London. This, however, came to an abrupt halt during World War II. To make a living during these difficult times, Rajaratnam became a journalist.
Rajaratnam and his Hungarian wife, Piroska Feher, returned to Malaya in 1947 where he secured a job with the Malaya Tribune the following year. After two years with the publication, Rajaratnam joined the Singapore Standard as an associate editor before moving to The Straits Times where he worked for five years.
During the course of his journalism career, Rajaratnam wrote pieces opposing colonial rule and communist ideologies. These articles attracted the attention of Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye and Goh Keng Swee. In 1954, the four of them, together with other founding members, formed the PAP.
Rajaratnam, whose views widely resonated with locals, contested in the 1959 Legislative Assembly general election and won a spot as assemblyman for the constituency of . He was also appointed Minister for Culture.

Putting Singapore on the map
When Singapore gained independence in 1965, Rajaratnam became the nation’s first ever minister for foreign affairs. He was effective in this role, forging positive relationships with other nations and successfully articulating Singapore’s brand and credo. In 1968, he took on another portfolio – that of Minister of Labour.

Closer to home Rajaratnam was recognised as one of the founding fathers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, having represented Singapore in 1967 at an event designed to establish the regional economic union.
In Singapore, Rajaratnam is celebrated for developing the national pledge shortly after the island’s emotionally wrought separation from Malaysia. The oath he drafted espouses timeless values such as racial harmony, unity, equality and progress. On National Day, Singaporeans young and old, standing with their right fists over their hearts, pledge to uphold these principles and standards.
Rajaratnam continued to serve faithfully on homeground. In 1980, he became the second deputy prime minister, a position he held for five years before taking on the responsibility of senior minister in the Prime Minister’s Office for three years. He eventually retired in 1988.
Rajaratnam remembered
Rajaratnam never stopped working. He served as a senior distinguished fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asia Studies from 1988 to 1997.4
The numerous world leaders and throngs of Singaporeans who convened at the Esplanade for his state funeral in February 2006, was a reflection of the deep respect he had earned from people far and wide over the course of his career. The same year, Raffles Institution named a new building in his honour. The Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University followed suit, renaming itself the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in 2007.5

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2015
Tan Tock Seng, Goh Keng Swee and the late Lee Kuan Yew — all integral Singaporean icons, and all of them “Peranakan”. The Malay word “Peranakan” commonly refers to the creolized Chinese who lived in Southeast Asia. The community gained a reputation with its close ties to the British under colonial rule, but were also crucial players in Sun Yat Sen’s revolutionary activities and of course, our country’s rise since independence. In celebration of our country’s 50th anniversary, an exhibition showcasing the lives of 50 great Peranakans who contributed significantly to the development of our nation ran at the Peranakan Museum in 2015.
The featured 50 Peranakans in the exhibition
‘Great Men’
In our reading of Singapore’s history, we must not forget the pivotal role Peranakans have played in shaping it — from the obscure kapitans, the baba captains of industry, to members of our first Legislative Council. We must also dispel the myths and misconceptions surrounding the community. The Peranakans were not merely rich, English-educated dilettantes who collaborated with the British and Dutch colonial masters, nor were they part of the large migration of Chinese who came to Singapore to find a better life. Women are outnumbered in the selected group for the exhibition, which to a certain extent reflects the cloistered lives of nyonyas before the twentieth century. But while the lives of Peranakan women are not as well documented, their contributions are apparent in the community’s culture, including in the aspects of dress, food, residences, and social behaviour.
Crossing Boundaries
The Peranakans’ influence spread beyond the shores of Singapore. While the 50 featured in the exhibition were selected based on their contributions to Singapore, many were born and had made large impacts elsewhere. The community’s strong connections to Malacca, Penang, and Java highlight Singapore’s comparative newness as an independent entity. From 1819 to 1959, Singapore functioned as a British colony and the centrepiece of the Straits Settlements. Many of the individuals who found their way to the young nation also had connections and family networks throughout the region.
The Peranakans were quick to adapt to changing political circumstances. During the colonial period, they became powerful compradors and collaborators with the British and Dutch regimes. With the rise of Chinese nationalism in the late nineteenth century, some became crucial players in Sun Yat Sen’s revolutionary activities both within and outside China. Most leaders saw no contradiction in supporting both the British and the Chinese. World War II marked a turning point, after which some Peranakans began to champion for an independent Singapore and Malaya. The common caricature of Peranakans as “King’s Chinese” and their closeness to the British should not obscure their active engagement with Chinese culture and the Chinese community. Although many Peranakans lost their fluency and literacy in Chinese, they nonetheless supported Chinese or bilingual education, and founded Chinese newspapers. Some Peranakans converted to Christianity from around 1900, while others rediscovered Confucianism. Peranakans carefully balanced the two empires of British and Chinese. As they knelt loyally to receive visiting British royals, they also paid homage to Qing dignitaries. As some proudly received British decorations, they also purchased overseas Chinese honours.
Beyond their national contributions, a study of institutional histories and memories related to the selected Peranakans has also revealed individual legacies. These are documented in temples, associations, churches, schools, hospitals, and private families, as well as in libraries, archives, and museums. Many of the objects shown in the exhibition are hybrid in form and design. The exhibition did not attempt to represent or define a Peranakan aesthetic, but, rather, celebrated the variety and inconsistencies within the community. Memoirs, interviews, and private collections paint intimate images of these exemplary figures. The objects featured in this exhibition ranged from spectacular furnishings, personal belongings, and rare portraits, to humble images, handwritten papers, and objects of everyday use.
One notable aspect of Peranakan families today is the extent of their knowledge of their past and their relations, whether by blood, marriage, or friendship. The Peranakan Museum is grateful for their generosity in supporting this exhibition and has been impressed by the strong sense of community and connectivity among Peranakans — ties which seem to have strengthened in recent years with the revival of interest in Peranakan culture. The Peranakans remind us that Singapore has long been closely connected with family and trade networks with the region — not only Penang and Malacca but also Jakarta and the rest of Java, and elsewhere. Taken as a whole, the biographies and objects on display in the exhibition illuminate not just the history of the Peranakans in Singapore, but that of the wider nation as well.
Tan Tock Seng
The First Community Leader 1798–1850
Portrait of Tan Tock Seng, 1950s. Oil on canvas. Collection of Tan Jiew Hoe.
Born in Malacca, Tan Tock Seng moved to Singapore in the year it was founded by the British. He sold produce before building a fortune as a landowner in partnership with J. H. Whitehead of Shaw, Whitehead and Co. Tan was the first Asian to be appointed a Justice of the Peace in Singapore and is remembered principally for founding Singapore’s first hospital for poor Chinese.
At the request of the governor of Singapore, William Butterworth, Tan contributed $7,000 to start a public hospital. In 1844, the foundation was laid for the Chinese Paupers’ Hospital, which received its first patients in 1849. The hospital was named after Tan Tock Seng after his death in 1850.
Lim Nee Soon
Pineapple King And Chinese Nationalist Supporter 1879–1936

In 1911, Lim Nee Soon started a rubber and pineapple company. His large plantations in the booming pineapple industry soon earned him the nickname of “pineapple king”. A close friend of Sun Yat Sen, Lim became deeply involved in Chinese Nationalist politics. In 1904, together with Teo Eng Hock and Tan Chor Nam, he founded the revolutionary newspaper Thoe Lam Jit Poh (图南日报). Lim also participated in the founding of the Singapore branch of the Tong Meng Hui (同盟会), the Nationalist underground organisation. The organizers met at Teo Eng Hock’s house, Wan Qing Yuan (晚晴园), which is today the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall. In 1925, Lim became an honorary advisor to the president of China. He was given a state funeral in Nanjing and buried near Sun Yat Sen’s mausoleum.
Goh Soon Tioe
Maestro and Impresario 1911–1982
Goh Soon Tioe, 1940s. Photograph. Collection of Vivien Goh.
Goh Soon Tioe was a pioneer in the development of classical music in Singapore. Born in Padang, Sumatra, he came to Singapore at the age of 13 to study at the Anglo-Chinese School. Goh only started violin lessons at the age of 15 but showed great promise, and in 1932 he left for Switzerland to join the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève, where he studied for three years. During his time there, he was awarded the “Premier Prix” — first prize — in each annual exam.
In 1954, Goh founded the Goh Soon Tioe String Orchestra. In the 1950s and 1960s, he ventured into concert promotion by bringing internationally renowned musicians to perform in Singapore. However, he was not able to continue organising these concerts because, as he observed, “costs are heavy and work is hard”. In his studio above a garage in Oldham Lane and later in his home in Balmoral Crescent, he taught many of Singapore’s musical prodigies, including violinists Lynnette Seah and Lee Pan Hon, pianists Seow Yit Kin and Melvyn Tan, and conductor Choo Hoey. Goh was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1963 in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the music scene in Singapore.
Lee Choo Neo
Singapore’s First Female Doctor 1895–1947
Wedding photograph of Teo Koon Lim and Lee Choo Neo, 1922. Photograph. Collection of Vera Teo.
Lee Choo Neo was Singapore’s first female physician. Breaking away from the tradition of the cloistered nyonya, she used her privileged position to help enact social reforms. Lee was the daughter of Lee Hoon Leong, a Peranakan from Semarang who was manager of Oei Tiong Ham’s shipping business in Singapore. Educated at the Singapore Chinese Girls’ School, she was the first Straits Chinese woman to obtain a Senior Cambridge certificate in 1911. She studied at the King Edward VII School of Medicine in Singapore, and became the city’s first Chinese female doctor in 1920. These were remarkable achievements considering the general Chinese cultural expectations of women’s roles.

Be Muse Volume 8 Issue 1 – Apr to June 2015
In recent years, the display of human remains has become a topic of discussion in Western countries, particularly those with a history of colonialism. The Codes of Ethics provided by the International Council of Museums (ICOM) and the Museum Association UK offer guidelines on how to handle such collections and address questions of aims, but they are primarily intended for Western societies that deal with opposition from “people of origin” – the descendants of the people whose remains are displayed. The guidelines do not specifically address human remains at museums in regions from which they originated.
As a former British colony in Southeast Asia, Singapore assimilates its familiarity with Asian cultures with concepts of museum governance based on western principles. Hence, it is in a good position to reconsider how such artefacts may be treated with sensitivity.
A Modern Framework For Handling Ancient Human Remains
Human remains in museums have historically been “implicated in situations of inequality”. In the United States, laws for the repatriation of human remains, such as the Native American Graves Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990, accorded indigenous communities “equal rights regarding their dead”. This paved the way for overseas communities to request for their ancestors’ remains from museums worldwide.
In the United Kingdom, laws allowing museum collections to be held for perpetuity were relaxed after unrelenting campaigning from such groups. Since 1995, the British Museum has received six requests from organisations - including the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and the Museum of New Zealand - making claims on its collections of human remains.
The British Department for Culture, Media and Sports eventually produced guidelines for the care and return of human remains in 2005. Similar provisions were also drafted for the Museum Association UK and the American Alliance of Museums, iterating the need for a formal framework to manage human remains on display in a sensitive and culturally appropriate manner.
The late ICOM Code of Professional Ethics, revised and adopted in 2004, stated that the display of human remains must “take into account the interests and beliefs of members of the community, ethnic or religious groups from whom the objects originated.” The code also highlighted the possibility of “originating communities” requesting for the removal and return of such remains from public display, and how museums could address these requests “expeditiously with respect and sensitivity”. As the secretariat of ICOM Singapore, the National Heritage Board (NHB) and its member museums in Singapore must adhere to the ICOM Code of Professional Ethics.
In particular, the way human remains are handled in three of the NHB’s member museums in Singapore is note-worthy. The collections in the Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM), the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, and the Department of Anatomy Museum in the National University of Singapore (NUS) are ethnographical, religious and medical in nature respectively. This allows us to see how different curatorial directions affect the treatment of human remains, and if such approaches may signal a way for other museums worldwide to follow.
A Level-headed Approach to a Headhunting Tradition
The ACM is an ethnographic museum that focuses on pan-Asian cultures and civilisations, including those originating from China, Southeast Asia, South Asia and West Asia. The Dayak Carved Human Skull is the centrepiece of a permanent display showcasing the lifestyle of the indigenous Dayak tribe of Borneo. It is physical proof that the Dayaks engaged in headhunting activities, even though the practice has long been outlawed by Malaysian and Indonesian governments in Borneo.
ACM went to great lengths to assure visitors that headhunting was not a form of brutal tribal behaviour. The catalogue gave a balanced view by explaining how the Dayak tradition of headhunting was an honourable means to “improve the community’s well-being” as human heads were “believed to contain a powerful beneficial spiritual essence”. In fact human heads were treated respectfully by the Dayaks. Major rituals followed each successful headhunting expedition. Captured heads were honoured and proudly displayed in the ancestral longhouse. Elaborate swirl patterns on the skulls show that these were not merely war trophies, but revered artefacts.
ACM thus framed its curation of the Dayak human skull within an anthropological understanding of the Dayak tribe. The Dayaks are portrayed as an important component of Nusantara (Malay world). The museum also noted similarities in social structures found in some communities in Riau-Lingga sultanates, where Singapore’s Malay community draws its ancestry.
Other museums such as Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and the Pennsylvanian Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum), which also included Dayak carved skulls in its collections, treated these artefacts with similar sensitivity. In a special volume of Penn Museum’s Expedition magazine, the tribe’s practice of headhunting was described in the social context of “contributing to the prosperity of community through performance of certain important rituals, such as the Iban Dayak kenyalang, which required fresh human heads for their performance”.
Curating The Religious Remains Of Buddha
The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum serves two functions. Firstly, it honours the tooth relic and other Buddhist relics, or sarira, purportedly from Gautama Buddha. Secondly, the temple exhibits these relics and other religious artefacts in a museum setting to impart Dharma and promote awareness of the faith.
The relics from Buddha’s remains are venerated and enshrined in elaborate reliquaries housed in the museum’s Relics Chamber. In Buddhism, the crystal-like sarira is the embodiment of spiritual energy culminated by Buddha and eminent monks during their lifetimes, and represent a person’s “sangha” or Buddhism learning. Buddhists believe that before Buddha’s departure, he had said: “...if thou all see my relics, it would be as good as meeting in person, as good as learning the Dharma and as good as knowing nirvana.” Hence, relics associated with Buddha’s remains are highly regarded by the religion’s devotees.
The centrepiece of the museum, the Buddha Tooth relic, is housed in a 3.6m-high stupa made with 270kg of gold that was donated by devotees. Buddhists believe that “relics can grow and multiply”, which may be seen as not only a testament of faith, but also a departure from conventional Asian attitudes in that devotees do not view exhibiting these remains as culturally taboo. Similar beliefs are seen elsewhere: Sri Lankan Buddhists view relics enshrined in the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy as a means of receiving Buddha’s blessings and to “procure wishes for economic wealth and health.” The translocation of the Buddha Tooth from Sri Lanka to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Singapore is also an example of how Buddhism may be spread via the veneration of these relics.
The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and its curation of Buddha’s remains are driven by the veneration for the Buddha Tooth and sarira. Its curatorial approach also focuses on how the display of such relics represent the religion’s beliefs and their spread across Asia.
Respecting a School’s “Silent Mentors”
At the Anatomy Museum (AM) in NUS, embalmed cadavers hold specific parts of the human body, which are arranged anatomically. The curatorial approach of AM may be described as that of a teaching museum founded on the educational needs of medical students and instructors.
The cadavers on display came from donors who had pledged their bodies for medical use after their deaths. That said, the bodies are only dissected and embalmed after a “claims” period of three years. As some facial features are still discernible, AM does not allow its handlers or viewers to take any pictures as a mark of respect. Students are also prohibited from making “Humourous and derogatory remarks” towards the cadavers. Visits to the museum must be booked ahead, and access is usually granted only to medical students and practitioners. Similar guidelines are practised in other pathology museums, including the Wellcome Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons, and The Gordon Museum in King’s College in the UK.
Unlike the controversial Body Worlds exhibition that showed plastinated cadavers in positions mimicking horse riding, fencing and swimming, the cadavers on display in AM are treated respectfully. Cadavers come with detailed write-ups of the donors’ medical histories which highlight the museum’s emphasis on education. The museum also runs a “Silent Mentor” programme that provides information for body donation, and holds an annual ceremony to show its appreciation towards “once living individuals whose bodies are used to impart invaluable anatomical knowledge”. These practices demonstrate a unique way for treating human remains with dignity.
Paving The Way Forward
Academics argue that exhibiting human remains perpetuates a “construction of otherness within an anthropological discourse that tends to privilege the visual and the spatial”. In other words, the once-living person is now viewed with a sense of detachment in the museum – not unlike an exotic artefact. Curation practices in these three Singapore museums thus demonstrate the importance of placing human remains within a larger context. From portraying headhunting as a unique ritual practised by Dayaks, to the veneration of Buddha’s relics as religious devotion, and the role of silent mentors, donated cadavers, play to students of the human body, all three museums have own a way to fulfill their respective curatorial objectives, while still according the remains with the deepest respect possible.

MuseSG Volume 8 Issue 1 – Apr to Jun 2015
Maps are fascinating objects. Visual and textual, they tell us about the world they depict and provide a glimpse into the worldview of their makers. In Singapore, maps are especially significant as they are the earliest material evidence of our past.
As part of Geo|Graphic: Celebrating Maps and their Stories, exhibitions and programmes were organized by the National Library that explored maps and mapping in both historical and contemporary contexts. They ran until 19 July 2015.
The two historical exhibitions — Land of Gold and Spices: Early Maps of Southeast Asia and Singapore, and Island of Stories: Singapore Maps — showcase the collections of the National Library and the National Archives of Singapore respectively. They provide amazing insight into the history and transformation of Singapore’s landscape, and how Southeast Asia was imagined and mapped by the Europeans.
Geo|Graphic’s contemporary art components, Mind the Gap: Mapping the Other, and SEA STATE 8 seabook: An Art Project by Charles Lim (co-organised with the NUS Museum), invited visitors to reflect on the concepts of mapping and what maps might look like in the hands of an artist.
Here are some highlights from the exhibitions Land of Gold and Spices and Island of Stories.
Map featuring a naval battle by Theodore de Bry, Frankfurt, 1607. | Collection of National Library, Singapore
Printed in 1607, this is a schematic map of a brutal Luso-Dutch naval confrontation that took place between 6 and 11 October 1603, in the Johor River (Rio Batusabar) and close to Pedra Branca (Pedro Blanca). The Johor Fleet (allies of the Dutch) is shown waiting at a shoal off the eastern coast of Singapore. The map, produced by Flemish goldsmith, engraver and publisher Theodore de Bry (1528–98), has been drawn with the east orientated to the top.
One of the earliest representations of Singapore’s coastline, the map is also significant for depicting the battle that illustrates the strategic importance of the Singapore Strait as a waterway connecting the Indian ocean to the South China Sea.
Strait of Singapore, circa 1675-1700 | Collection of Leiden University Library
This hand-drawn chart that shows the Straat Sincapura (Strait of Singapore) is a V.O.C. (Dutch East India Company)-based chart and might have been derived from an earlier version. The outline of the Long Island (‘t Lang Eylant) referring to Singapore is not completed at the northern part, perhaps reflecting the cartographer’s lack of knowledge of the area. To the south of the strait, a large landmass can be seen. It has a phrase stating that to the southern side of the Singapore Strait are broken islands, or gebrooken eilanden. The cartographer has not drawn the outline of the numerous islands, as little is known about them. This chart with soundings and compass-rose lines, however, identifies two navigational landmarks in the Singapore Strait: Johor Hill and the twin peaks of Bintan, both of which are highlighted in black ink.
Detail of a map of Singapore and the Melaka Strait by Jacques Nicolas Bellin, Paris, 1755 | Collection of National Library, Singapore
Jacques Nicolas Bellin (1703–72) was a French hydrographer who created maps for several key publications in the 18th century. On this map, Bellin depicts the island of Singapore and calls it Pulo or Isle Panjang (Pulau Panjang, meaning Long Island in Malay, or Panjang Island). If the main island of Singapore is named at all on early European maps, it is most often called Pulau Panjang. On this map, the old Strait of Singapore (Vieux Detroit de Sincapour) is shown as the waterway between Singapore and Johor, which is known today as the Johor or Tebrau Strait (Selat Tebrau in Malay).
Interestingly, Bellin shows two islands on the Johor Strait: Salat Buro and Joor. It seems that Salat Buro, or Selat Tebrau, has been mistakenly depicted as an island; similarly, Joor is presumed to be Johor Lama. The two islands depicted are likely to be present-day Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. The lack of knowledge on most European maps about the Johor Strait suggests that European navigators did not use this maritime route much.
Singapore Harbour: Proposed improvements, 1904 | Singapore Harbour Board collection | Courtesy of National Archives of Singapore
By the early 20th century, Singapore, dubbed the “Gateway to the East”, had become a major international port serving the thriving trade between Asia and Europe. The sheer volume of ships and cargo that Singapore handled strained its port’s infrastructure, which had become inadequate to meet its growing requirements by the late 19th century. This necessitated major harbour improvements, and this map of the Singapore harbour shows the proposed harbour improvement works drawn up in 1904 by the British government’s consulting engineer Coode, Son & Matthews. It contains hydrographic details, including the soundings of the harbour, and the direction and velocity of the harbour’s tides.
Some of the proposed improvements included plans to reclaim land to extend and straighten the wharf at Telok Ayer to make it easier and safer for ships to dock; to deepen the harbour; and to construct a series of moles, or breakwaters. But due to budget and technical difficulties, and public outcry against the move, only the southern inner mole was built. The one-mile-long (about 1.6 km) detached breakwater would remain a major landmark in Singapore until the late 1970s, when the waters around and behind the breakwater were reclaimed to create Marina Bay.
Map of Syonan City, 1943 | Port of Singapore Authority | Collection of National Archives of Singapore
The Imperial Japanese Army reprinted copies of the British Survey Department maps, and this particular reprint of the Singapore Gazetteer Map shows the main roads in the town area of Singapore renamed in Japanese script.
While most of the road names remained unchanged and were simply spelt out phonetically in the Japanese katakana script, public buildings, such as government buildings, hospitals and even cinemas, were given new Japanese names. For instance, Capitol Cinema, Cathay Cinema and Raffles Hotel were renamed Kyo-Ei Gekijo (共榮), Dai To’a Gekijo (大東亜劇場) and Shonan Ryokan (昭南旅館), respectively. The selective renaming of such public landmarks allowed the Japanese administration to assert sovereignty over Syonan-to — Singapore’s name during the Occupation — without causing widespread confusion.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/belly-of-the-carp/belly-of-the-carp,"Back in the days when a journey to far off lands usually meant a long sea voyage, ports were the hubs of exchange – a merchant’s gateway to international trade, a captain’s safe harbour to refuel and a land of opportunity for anyone willing to work hard.
When it was called Temasek, Singapore was one of many port cities situated along the Straits of Malacca; the gateway in and out of Southeast Asia. It had a deep sea harbour and was strategically located between India and China, making it a promising entrepot.

Singapore’s growth as a port
Leveraging the island’s reputation as an ancient port of importance with traders in the region, the groundwork laid by Major-General William Farquhar and aspirations of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 caused Singapore to become one of the premier places for international trade, business and success.
In contrast to the Dutch – another maritime power that controlled trade in the Malay Archipelago – the decision by Raffles to make Singapore a free port attracted merchants from the region and beyond. In just two years, almost 3,000 vessels with 200,000 tonnes of cargo visited the port, and in four years, the population had grown to more than 10,000.

Along the winding river, Boat Quay would be the first stretch to experience the transformation. This particular part of the river became known as the “Belly of the Carp” because of its curved shape which resembled the fish, deemed an auspicious symbol by the Chinese. It was at this location that many godowns and warehouses were built. It quickly became crowded with cargo-packed bumboats. The sight of junks and cargo boats with flapping sails became a common sight on the river.
Singapore soon became one of the most popular ports to trade at. Besides serving as the centre of trade in Southeast Asia, the island overtook Batavia as the main hub for Chinese junk trade. This was only the beginning, and Singapore eventually supplanted the Riau Islands as the export gateway for the gambier and pepper industry of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago, as well as South Johor. Even the Teochew trade in marine produce and rice came to our shores.
Constructing roads and architecture
A significant milestone in the evolution of the port was the construction of roads and railways to support the bustling sea trade. Primary materials such as crude oil, rubber and tin from the Malay Peninsula were transported to Singapore for further processing into staple products, before being shipped off to Britain and other international markets.
Besides the merchants and businessmen, the types of visitors started to grow to include a mix of travellers and seamen. “La Favourite”, a French corvette on a voyage to sail around the world, also found respite in Singapore’s safe harbour for five days en route to far-off New Zealand.
This print (aquatint) shows the French corvette ‘La Favorite’, under the command of Captain Cyrille Laplace, which sailed eastwards around the world between 1830 and 1833. (c. 1856. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
Raffles directed land on the north bank to be reserved for government buildings; the east of this plot was allocated to the Europeans, and further east for the Arabs and Bugis. However, the needs of commerce thwarted this plan to some extent, as both European and Asian merchants preferred to locate their businesses by the riverside. Flat and spacious river banks were soon lined with trade houses. These diversified the landscape and were soon followed by the brick warehouses, also known as godowns, ready to receive and store goods arriving on Singapore’s shores.
Ocean-faring vessels were too large to navigate the shallow waters of Singapore River. Instead, smaller flat-bottomed craft called lighters or bumboats would ferry cargo between these ships and the docks at the river.
The first stretch of the Singapore River to be developed, Boat Quay originated with Singapore’s first land reclamation project to build an embankment. This part of the river, popularly known as the “Belly of the carp”, brimmed with traditional cargo boats until the Singapore River clean-up was completed in the 1980s.
Commercial hubs such as Raffles Place, Market Street and Fullerton Square also emerged in the river’s vicinity as merchants and bankers gathered to exchange news and seize business opportunities, forming one of the key economic pillars of independent Singapore.
The Singapore River Settlement was captured by artist Percy Carpenter in the “View of Singapore from Mount Wallich” (which has now since been levelled for the land reclamation of Telok Ayer) in the 1850s. One can identify other landmarks in the painting such as the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Cathedral of the Good Shepherd and St Andrew’s Church.
But architecture and buildings were not the only things brightening up river life. The river was also filled with people of diverse communities who came from various parts of the world; some for work, and some for rest and recreation.
People along the River
Armies of coolies, lightermen and stevedores (dockworkers) toiled to unload bales of merchandise into riverside shops and warehouses, while new arrivals came ashore to seek their kinsmen and business associates, or look for work. After a long, hard day work, many who worked by the river would unwind on bridges such as Read Bridge and Coleman Bridge to enjoy a drink and listen to traditional storytellers.
These storytellers would entertain the river communities with tall tales and live music. At a time when literacy was low, newspaper readers would also draw crowds, serving an important function by keeping everyone abreast of the latest happenings.
This mingling of people from all corners of the globe led to cultures and traditions intersecting and interacting on a daily basis on our shores. The port built upon the banks of the Singapore River facilitated not just an exchange of goods, but also of cultures and dreams of building a future.
The Singapore River no longer functions as a harbour for trade, but it continues to flow past important landmarks, buildings and neighbourhoods that serve as a reminder of how modern Singapore began; with the establishment of a trading settlement and through the diverse communities who built and shaped it into the international hub it is today.

Be Muse Volume 7 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2014
For many Peranakan Chinese of Southeast Asia, religion and ritual play a central role in their daily lives. Many ceremonies, from Chinese New Year to the annual tomb cleaning (cheng beng) festival, involve setting up altars and invoking deities and ancestors. Altars usually hold religious paraphernalia and offerings. On special occasions, textiles are draped in front.
Altar cloths, called tok wi in Hokkien (zhuowei in Mandarin), are usually made of silk with embroidered designs and were originally imported from Southern China. Common motifs included dragons, phoenix, qilin, ruyi sceptre, swastika, and other auspicious symbols. The cloths are almost uniformly rectangular – to cover the shape of the front of a typical altar. An extra piece of fabric, also decorated, hangs as a flap over the upper section. Fragments of such hangings and altar frontals have been discovered in excavations of Tang-dynasty (618–907) monasteries near the Dunhuang Caves, in present day Gansu province, demonstrating that the tradition has been long-held.

By the early twentieth century, Peranakans on Java began using altar cloths made of local batik. These batik altar cloths maintained the form of the embroidered versions, though they adapted established Chinese symbols in imaginative renderings and introduced motifs and designs from Southeast Asian and European cultures. Most batik altar cloths are designed on a single piece of cotton cloth, with depicted, rather than actual, upper panels. It is unclear why Peranakans of Java began using batik altar cloths, but perhaps it was due in part to the already thriving batik industry on the island. Another theory could be that the tropical climate of the East Indies was more suited to textiles made of cotton than of silk. Batik altar cloths show the distinct cross-cultural identity of the Peranakan communities of the region. They are fascinating examples of a community’s adaptation to its new surroundings.

THE EXHIBITION
The Peranakan Museum received a donation of seventy-two batik altar cloths from Matthew and Alice Yapp in 2012. The cloths were collected by their son Alvin over a period of ten years. On 11 April 2014, the museum opened the exhibition Auspicious Designs: Batik for Peranakan Altars, which featured several highlights from the collection. The exhibition was divided into five sections over two floors of the museum's special exhibition gallery.
The first section was a contextual display featuring a deity altar and a set of furnishings that might be found in a typical Peranakan home. An altar cloth was draped over the front of the altar table, embroidered hangings adorn the doorways, and chairs flanking the altar were also covered in embroideries. This display emphasised the importance of textiles in demarcating sacred space during special occasions.
Traditional altar setup
The second section focused on the embroidered silk altar cloths made in China. These cloths were imported into Southeast Asia and used by Peranakans. An example on display was a full gold thread altar cloth depicting the Three Star Gods that once belonged to the Chee family, one of the oldest families from Malacca. This section showed examples of cloths that were forerunners to the batik versions produced later in Java.

The third and fourth sections of the exhibition examined the stylistic diversity found in the designs on batik altar cloths. Batik cloths in these two sections are decorated with designs that mix Chinese, Southeast Asian, and European influences.
One of the cloths prominently displayed the coat of arms of the Dutch East Indies at the centre, with Chinese cloud collar motifs at the sides. A selection of Chinese objects, from what are known as the Hundred Antiques, decorated the upper panel. This cloth is possibly one of the oldest batik altar cloths in the museum's collection: it was made using natural dyes.

Another cloth showed the influence of designs popular on batik sarongs. The blue and white cloth with the oral bouquet motif (called buketan in batik terminology) – a sarong design that was made popular by Dutch-Eurasian batik maker Eliza Van Zuylen – is an example of this. Another altar cloth in this section worth highlighting was the only cloth in the collection that is decorated with Roman letters – Chinese characters are much more common. The letters appear to spell the surnames “Hoe” (or “Koe”) and “Sioe”, if read from the centre along the border. The middle line reads “hong” and “leng”. In Hokkien, hong is phoenix and leng means dragon; both are depicted on this cloth. The creatures are often used as symbols of a bridal couple, which suggests this cloth may have been used in a wedding.

Altar cloths could also be a means of declaring political affiliation: a cloth from Yogyakarta shows human figures waving the flag of Nationalist China.

Another aspect of batik altar cloths highlighted in the exhibition was the varied interpretations of common Chinese symbols. Batik cloths featuring dragons and qilins, for example, are used to show the physical differences between the two creatures. Other objects featuring these two creatures from the collections of the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Peranakan Museum were displayed alongside these cloths, so that viewers could discuss similarities, and their possible sources.
One interesting comparison worth mentioning was a Balinese palanquin with nagas – a group of serpent deities – depicted on its sides, juxtaposed with a batik altar cloth that shows elongated dragons that more closely resemble the naga than the typical coiled or front-facing Chinese dragons found on embroidered altar cloths.
The fifth and last section provided visitors with the opportunity to learn more about the rituals per- formed by Peranakans, and how different altar cloths were used for different occasions. Cloths used during Chinese New Year and other celebratory events, for example, were coloured in strong auspicious reds and generally bright hues. For funerals, altar cloths with more sombre tones were selected.
These were colours often associated with mourning in the Peranakan world – blues, purples, and greens. An example of this on display was a dark blue cloth from Singapore, which features crane and deer motifs – symbolic of longevity – as well as the cicada, a symbol of immortality.
As with the diverse designs found on them, batik altar cloths are distinctive examples of the cross- cultural interaction inherent in the hybrid identities of the Peranakans. Although these cloths – whether embroidered or batik – have long been a feature of Chinese altars, research into their past remains limited. This exhibition therefore aimed to be a preliminary investigation of these culturally and historically rich textiles, and their multiple influences.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 4 - Oct to Dec 2010
Cheong Soo Pieng (1917-1983) is generally regarded today as one of the most innovative and influential Singapore artists of the 20th century. Essays on him usually focus on his experimental spirit and formalistic innovations, often highlighting his synthesis of Western and Chinese art traditions. For an artist whose practice was so rich and diverse, there remain many fertile areas for future research, of which art patronage is one.
Artists do not live in a vacuum. In early 20th century Singapore, many China-born and trained artists such as Cheong had to initially make a living by teaching art full-time, either in an academy like the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) or local schools. This meant that they had little time for their own practice. Amongst the early NAFA lecturers in the 1940s and 1950s, only a few such as Cheong and Chen Wen Hsi (1906-1991) eventually had the good fortune of early retirement to become full-time artists. Nevertheless, they had to continue to give private art tuition, work on commissions or even start businesses (as in the case of Chen who owned two art galleries) to ensure an alternative income source. What gave them the confidence to give up their full-time jobs to pursue art must, in part, have been the support they received in Singapore and abroad from patrons whom they could count on to either buy their works or recommend them to other collectors.
In Cheong’s case, he started teaching at NAFA in 1947, one year after settling down in Singapore. He eventually left his job in 1961. Between 1946 and 1961, he held three successful solo shows in Singapore (1956), Kuala Lumpur and Penang (1957). He later travelled to Europe for two years and held exhibitions in London (Frost and Reed Gallery, 1962; Redfern Gallery, 1963), Munich (Galerie Schöninger, 1962) and Oxford (Bear Lane Gallery, 1963). In 1962, he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by the Government of the State of Singapore. He was later honoured in 1967 with a retrospective exhibition at the National Art Gallery in Kuala Lumpur (his 12th solo show) in celebration of his 50th birthday and 25 years as an art teacher.
The support he received from patrons between the late 1940s and the early 1960s likely gave him the confidence and means to become a full-time artist who could travel around the world. This essay is a preliminary examination of Cheong’s practice in relation to the burgeoning art market during this period and especially his ties with a key patron from that era – Dato Loke Wan Tho. In particular, it will analyse some of Cheong’s works that were collected and later donated by Loke and his estate to the then National Museum of Singapore (now part of the National Heritage Board collection). Hopefully, future research will throw greater light on the critical roles played by various patrons in the development of Cheong’s practice and the reception of his works in Singapore and abroad.

Art Scene in Singapore
After the devastation caused by World War II in Singapore, the local art scene slowly regained its footing. In 1946, teaching resumed at NAFA where Cheong became a teacher a year later. During that period, art groups like the Society of Chinese Artists re-established themselves, whilst new ones like the Singapore Art Society (SAS) and Society of Malay Artists (Persekutuan Pelukis Melayu) were set up in 1949. Such societies provided much-needed platforms for artistic exchange and joint exhibitions.
With the erosion of ties with China especially after the start of communist rule in 1949, the idea of a regional Malayan or Nanyang1 identity began to take root amongst the Chinese in Singapore. They started to identify themselves with the region, rather than the place of their birth. This was especially evident in literature and later, the visual arts. Interestingly, the need for a Malayan identity was also echoed by the British colonial government then. The Malayan Emergency took place from 1948 to 1960, during which the British government imposed severe measures to counter the communist insurgency in Malaya. The British also embarked on a cultural strategy to win the hearts and minds of the Malayan public against acts of terror by the Malayan Communist Party. In order to achieve this, the British hoped to create a shared Malayan culture to unite the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo to stand against the Communist threat. Hence, the authorities worked closely with organisations like the SAS. For instance, in the 1950s, the British Council Hall was made available to many cultural and welfare groups, and the SAS even had its administrative office in the council premises.
In the 1950s, the concept of regionalism also dovetailed with growing nationalist sentiments and calls for decolonisation in the region as Singapore moved towards independence in 1965. This need for a Malayan identity continued even after Singapore gained self-government in 1959. One of the first ministries the new local government set up was the Ministry of Culture which was “vested with responsibility of formulating policies needed to create a common Malayan culture”.2
Art Market In Singapore
The abovementioned circumstances brought forth a flurry of exhibitions in Singapore, especially those organised by groups such as SAS. An editorial entitled “Singapore Wakes Up” in the 1955 SAS magazine reported, “It is probable that visual arts have received more attention and publicity in Singapore in the first eight weeks of 1955 than in any corresponding period in local history. There have been seven exhibitions, seven broadcasts, six public lectures, an unprecedented number of meetings of the various committees of Singapore Art Society, and The Singapore Artist has been widely bought and read.”3
In the 1940s and 1950s, there were no private art galleries in Singapore. Although venues like the Straits Commercial Art Company shop provided some space for artists like Cheong to display paintings, their primary business was not the sale of artworks. So, in those early years, exhibitions such as those organised by SAS provided critical opportunities for artists to show and sell their works to the public. For instance, the first exhibition held by SAS in 1950 featuring 278 works by 76 local artists, attracted over 6500 visitors and garnered sales of $3363.4
The buyers of such works then were mostly European expatriates and affluent locals. Amongst the more prominent in the former group were art promoter Frank Sullivan5 and art historian Michael Sullivan.6 In the latter group, the most famous was Dato Loke Wan Tho. Although there were other well-known collectors in Malaya then, like Tan Tsze Chor and Wong Man Sze, they tended to collect only Chinese art and antiquities, and had few or no works by contemporary Malayan artists like Cheong. The one exception was Loh Cheng Chuan from Penang who was not only a well-known collector of Chinese art but also a keen patron of local artists.
A Key Patron of The Era: Loke Wan Tho (1915 - 1964)
To many, the late Dato Loke Wan Tho is best known for leading the Cathay Organisation to become an important producer and distributor of Malay and Chinese films in the 1940s and 1950s. His regional business empire included cinemas, film studios and hotels. He was a much sought-after public figure and chairman of major institutions such as the Malayan Airways Ltd and Singapore Telephone Board. Often seen in the company of high government officials and glamorous film stars, he was very much one of the leading members of the Malayan establishment then.

Loke was a man of diverse interests and talents. A keen sportsman, he had a great love for nature. He was an accomplished ornithologist and photographer, and combined both interests to become an award-winning photographer of birds. Loke was also known as a great philanthropist. In particular, he was a tireless supporter of the arts and gave generously of his time and collections to various museums. Through his gifts, Loke supported the founding of the University Art Museum at the University of Malaya in the 1950s.7 As a collector, his interests were eclectic, ranging from Chinese ceramics8 to local modern art. In the latter, he was ably assisted by his personal secretary of 24 years, Ms Ann Talbot-Smith (1905-1983), who was herself also greatly interested in local artists.9
A sampling of Loke’s activities as an art patron in the 1950s and 1960s reveals that he was supportive of a wide range of local artists. He was the guest of honour for the opening of exhibitions by established artists such as Chen Wen Hsi10 as well as younger ones like Lu Chon Min.11 For the latter group, these shows mattered a great deal as the artists often relied on the sales proceeds of such exhibitions to fund their overseas studies.12
By the early 1950s, Loke was already active with the SAS, having organised its first photographic exhibition with his good friend and SAS president Dr Carl Gibson-Hill in 1950. And Loke continued to maintain close ties with the SAS through the 1950s and early 1960s. For instance, besides serving as patron of the society in 1960,13 he also opened many of its shows as guest of honour and bought many works at such events. Loke’s secretary Talbot-Smith was also closely associated with the SAS, having served as its secretary for a time.14
By the late 1950s, Loke was regarded as having Singapore’s largest collection of works by local artists, numbering some 80 works. This was later augmented in 1957 by his purchase of another 64 works from Frank Sullivan who was then SAS vice-president.15 Loke had planned to display them with his own collection in Singapore’s first community art gallery.16 This eventually culminated in Loke’s decision to donate 99 paintings to the Ministry of Culture in 1960. The list of donated works by 50 artists included well-known names like Cheong as well as younger ones like Thomas Yeo.17 In 1962, Loke added 15 more paintings to the earlier 99 he gave.18 And after Loke’s untimely demise in 1964, his estate made another gift of his collection to the state.
Artist And Patron
When Cheong arrived from China in 1946, Loke was already based in Singapore, reviving his family’s cinema business after the war. At that time, Cheong was busy teaching at NAFA and had not yet had his first solo show in 1956. Although it is not clear when Loke first met Cheong, the latter was already taking part in group exhibitions then.19 Hence, it is likely that, given his interest in art, Loke would have encountered Cheong’s works at annual group exhibitions such as the one organised by the prominent Society of Chinese Artists in 1948 which featured an oil painting by Cheong of a female bather rendered in a cubist-like manner.20 In 1951, Cheong teamed up with Chen Wen Hsi, Chen Chong Swee and Liu Kang, to present a group show called Four Artists from China organised by SAS.21 The same four artists held another group exhibition in 1953 under the auspices of SAS, after their 1952 trip to Bali. Again, it is highly probable that Loke, given his ties with SAS, would have heard of, if not seen Cheong’s works at both shows.
Amongst the works by Cheong donated by Loke, the earliest painting is Indian Men with Two Cows (1949). This was listed as ‘Kampong Scene’ and already in Loke’s collection when it was exhibited by the SAS in an exhibition titled Ten Years of Art in Singapore in 1956. However, it still does not provide the date of Loke’s first purchase of Cheong’s works as the painting could have been bought at any time between 1949 and 1956.

However, there is an ink portrait by Cheong of Loke’s second wife – the beautiful and glamorous Christina Lee – completed in 1953. This indicates that at least, by the early 1950s, Cheong was familiar enough with Loke to have completed a portrait of the latter’s wife.

Apart from Cheong, Christina Lee was known to have posed for a number of famous artists including Xu Beihong, Basoeki Abdullah, Lee Man Fong and Sun Yee.22

Three years later in 1956, Loke was the guest of honour at the opening of Cheong’s first solo show in Singapore. Organised by SAS at the British Council Gallery, the show featured a wide range of media, including oils, watercolours, batik, gouache, Chinese ink and sketches. It is helpful here to highlight the close connection between Loke and Frank Sullivan, as the latter was the SAS exhibition organiser for the said show. And again in 1963, Loke opened Cheong’s exhibition at the Victoria Memorial Hall in Singapore, showing mostly works completed after the artist’s trip to Europe in the preceding two years. The fact that Cheong invited Loke to be the guest of honour at his first solo show in Singapore and that Loke, a highly-regarded personality, twice agreed to officiate at Cheong’s shows, testify to the growing relationship between the two men.

It is highly probable that Loke would have shown his encouragement by purchasing Cheong’s works at such openings. By the 1950s, Loke was widely known in the art circles for his admiration and support of Cheong. He reportedly bought two to three paintings by Cheong every month and hung them in his office. Loke also gave some of those paintings to his business partners in Europe.23 Cheong’s daughter Leng Guat recalled that Loke’s secretary Talbot-Smith used to visit her father’s studio periodically to select paintings, usually Chinese ink, for such gifts.24  Talbot-Smith also sometimes brought Cathay’s guests to meet Cheong in his studio.25 His student Thomas Yeo recalled that in the late 1950s, many of Cheong’s collectors were either British expatriates living in Singapore or friends introduced by Loke. Occasionally, Frank Sullivan and Michael Sullivan also brought visitors to his studio.26
A number of Cheong’s mural commissions in the 1950s and 1960s such as those for Cathay Organisation (1955) and Singapore Telephone Board (1959), were also likely made possible through Loke’s connections.27 Loke’s support of Cheong in the 1950s during the Emergency period was helpful as this was a period when the British colonial government was generally suspicious of artists from China.28 Loke was well-regarded by the British elite in Singapore and on good terms with the then Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom in South East Asia, Malcolm MacDonald.29 The latter, who was also an admirer of Cheong’s works, bought paintings for his own collection as well as to give to friends during his tenure in Singapore between 1946 and 1955.30
Over time, Loke and Cheong developed a warm and easy-going relationship. They met fairly regularly, usually conversing in Cantonese. The Cheong family used to visit the Lokes during Chinese New Year.31 Cheong also dropped in, sometimes unannounced, on Loke at his Cathay office to either show new works, or introduce promising young artists to him. Despite his busy schedule, Loke often made time to meet Cheong.32 By the time Cheong left for Europe in 1962, he was already quite a successful artist and sufficiently well off to embark on a two-year long trip.33 Loke continued his support in various ways. During Cheong’s European trip, Loke together with others, helped to effect introductions to London galleries such as Frost and Reed, and Redfern, where Cheong eventually held his exhibitions.34 Through his networks with the media industry, Loke was also able to arrange a TV interview for Cheong in the United Kingdom.35 In addition, Loke used his wide business contacts to introduce Cheong to collectors in France and Italy.36
The Loke Collection
There are 12 works by Cheong in the NHB collection which were donated by Loke and his estate. Two paintings – Balinese Selling Toddy (1954) and Bali Beach (1955) – were most probably from the Frank Sullivan collection which Loke purchased in 1957.

These two works were likely acquired earlier by Sullivan when he helped to organise Cheong’s first solo show in Singapore in 1956.37 The 12 works do not represent an exhaustive list of Cheong’s paintings acquired by Loke. There are probably more works in the collections of Cathay Organisation and the extended Loke family.38 However, they do provide a useful glimpse into the range of paintings Cheong produced after his arrival in Singapore in 1946 and prior to Loke’s demise in 1964. They also reflect the types of works that attracted the attention of key patrons like Loke and Sullivan, and conceivably other collectors and admirers of the period. The latter would include personalities in Singapore such as Malcolm MacDonald, Michael Sullivan, Madeleine Enright, Ann Talbot-Smith and Ho Kok Hoe, and those in Malaysia like P.G. Lim, Kington Loo and Loh Cheng Chuan.39
The paintings, evenly divided between six works done in oils and the rest on paper (either Chinese ink or watercolours), amply demonstrate Cheong’s proficiency in both Western and Chinese art traditions. Figurative works predominate, with only two landscapes and one still-life. Most of the figurative paintings feature scenes based on rural life such as Indian men tending cows or a Balinese selling toddy (a form of coconut wine). Others highlight local women (be they Malay, Balinese or Kenyah) in traditional dress. In these pictures, the women are usually shown against a backdrop of Southeast Asian motifs like palm fronds, tropical fruits, painted boats and oral patterned batik (a form of wax-resist dyed fabric).
The two landscapes depict scenes drawn from Cheong’s immediate surroundings. One shows a row of riverside shophouses – most likely along Singapore River – with boats and cars in the foreground. The other captures rustic wooden houses nestled amongst coconut trees with two Malay women in the foreground. These subjects convey an identity that is distinctly Southeast Asian. Consider the painting of a street vendor surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. The hawker’s loose singlet and wide-brimmed hat, together with the adjacent shirtless boy, hint at the hot and humid setting of the scene. Likewise for the painting of Singapore River – whilst the building facades may look European, the colourful green and red tongkangs (a form of cargo boats) bobbing in the waters are a reminder that such vessels are usually only found in this part of the world.
Such localised or Malayan themes were adopted by many local artists from the 1940s to the 1960s, both in response to their immediate physical environment as well as the growing interest in asserting a local identity. Such subjects were also consistent with the then British colonial authority’s attempts to create a shared Malayan culture amongst the local populace. Many expatriate collectors would have, understandably, also preferred works with explicitly local subjects as a reminder of the times they had spent in the region. As one of Cheong’s admirers Malcolm MacDonald had put it, “...whenever I contemplate one or another of them (Cheong’s paintings) I imagine that I had suddenly dropped in at a kampong in Malaya, a sea-shore resort on Singapore island, or a Dayak longhouse in the jungly interior of Sarawak.”40 Such was the evocative powers of Cheong’s works!
Lastly, an examination of three paintings featuring female figures (Bali Beach, Woman Lying Down and Untitled [Girl with Birdcage]) reveals Cheong’s innovative approaches between the late 1940s and early 1960s, which so captured his patrons’ attention. Whilst all three ostensibly depict similar subjects, the media and styles could not be more different. In the painting Bali Beach, Cheong demonstrated his proficiency with a Western medium, namely oil, and the stylistic features of key Western movements such as Primitivism, Cubism, Fauvism and Expressionism. He moved away from a straightforward representation of two topless women by reducing the female forms into simple graceful lines. The latter recall the sculpted features of indigenous wooden figurines as well as the rustic quality of the local way of life. The beach setting is captured by blocks of roughly applied brown, ochre and cream paint.
The blocks in turn form an interlocking design of angular planes which convey the effect of shifting light cast upon an undulating surface. Cheong also used strong bold colours, forming exaggerated contrasts, in order to accentuate the intensity of light and decorativeness of the tropics. Whilst the two ladies repose serenely on the beach, there is a sense of immediacy as certain elements such the boat, the basket of fruits and the lying woman’s feet have been cropped out by the picture’s edge, akin to the framing of a camera’s lens. The scene also pulsates with tropical fervour through Cheong’s application of paint in strong expressive strokes. Details like the patterns on the sarong (a loose garment made of a long strip of cloth wrapped around the body) worn by the seated female are sketched with quick fluid flourishes, suggestive of an individualistic spontaneity.
Cheong was also equally at home with Chinese ink painting. In Woman Lying Down, he used the long horizontal format associated with Chinese traditional hand scrolls. The latter are conventionally associated with landscape painting where a viewer is meant to experience travelling through the mountains and rivers as the landscape is slowly unrolled with the scroll. However, in this case, Cheong chose the subject of a reclining female which is usually more associated with the Western figurative paintings of Gauguin or Matisse, both known for their depictions of females in exotic locales. In this picture, Cheong had conveyed the feminine charm of his model through soft lyrical lines in ink. The Southeast Asian setting was captured through his careful attention to the woman’s elongated ears weighed down by heavy earrings and her oral patterned sarong. The figure’s affinity to nature is suggested by the large banana leaf on which she rests, whilst her rural occupation seems to be hinted at, by what appears to be a round woven tray in the background. The relatively flat colour washes used for the figure are in sharp contrast with her background which is completely filled with varying shades of ink. These, apart from bringing the female form into sharp relief, also provides an amorphous setting that alternately suggests receding depth as well as shifting light and shadow, constantly in flux.
Cheong Soo Pieng, Woman Lying Down, 1949, 37.5 x 94.5 cm, Chinese ink and colour on paper, Donated by Loke Wan Tho's Collection. Collection of National Heritage Board.
Unlike Woman Lying Down which is a fairly representational depiction of a female figure, Cheong used a very different approach in the third work Untitled (Girl with Birdcage). It is also an ink painting but this time, the vertical composition is akin to the traditional hanging scroll format. Here, a standing woman is seen in the foreground and her Southeast Asian setting is suggested by her dress and headwear. The female form is now somewhat distorted through the elongation of her neck and arms as well as her heavily lidded eyes. Another person is seen peering through a curtained window in the top left corner of the painting, beside which hangs two birdcages, a common sight in many rural Malay homes. In this work, Cheong departed from Chinese painting aesthetics which conventionally dictate that parts of the paper surface should be left unpainted to suggest the physical setting of subjects, be it the ground, sky or water. Here, Cheong had almost filled up the painting surface with a grid of heavy ink lines and blocks of greens, blues, purples, pinks, browns and greys. Most interestingly, Cheong integrated the two figures into the overall composition of rectilinear blocks, which even extended to the woman’s dress. The grid-like pattern recalls the abstract works of Mondrian but, at the same time, also conveys the patchwork quality seen in many wooden stilted houses in Malay villages. The latter often use wooden planks for construction of its walls, which are then painted in bright colours.

These three works amply exemplify how Cheong was able to bring together diverse media, techniques and approaches drawn from many art traditions, in order to capture slices of Southeast Asian life. In an era where the modern artist was celebrated for innovation, Cheong was able to assert his identity as a modern Asian artist in several ways. Firstly, his links with Asia were maintained through his foundation in Chinese ink painting tradition. At the same time, he was able to demonstrate his knowledge of international trends, particularly in Western modern art, both in his oil paintings as well as his innovative Chinese paintings. Thirdly, his Southeast Asian subjects also reflected his immediate reality, both physical and social, which in turn helped to connect him with his audiences in Singapore. As the art historian Michael Sullivan had succinctly put it in 1960, “His work is modern, yet not beyond the understanding of people of any feeling. It is influenced by modern art, but is by no means an imitation of it. It depicts the Malayan scene and yet does not merely illustrate or record it. It is, in fact, a true expression of the feelings of an artist who is at one with the world he lives in.”41

Notes"
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Billy-Wong-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"For 67-year-old Billy Wong, photography has been a passion and his one-and-only job since he completed National Service in 1975. He learnt photography from a professional photographer by serving as his assistant for five years before becoming a full-fledged photographer himself. Back then, aided by his background in Graphic Design, he took pictures for events and of commercial products.
Today, he still does freelance photography and, with more flexible working hours, contributes his talent as a volunteer as well.
“I started volunteering because of my wife’s keen interest. She said I had too much free time, and wanted me to get busy,” he recalls with a chuckle. His wife, Susan, is a freelance tour guide. She is a Heritage Volunteer who organises and helps out with the logistics of museum events.
Together, through an online portal, giving.sg, they embarked on a volunteering journey to do something meaningful. He adds simply, “We just see what organisations need and try to meet the need.”
Rich experiences
Billy started off as a volunteer guide in 2014, giving tours to children and senior citizens. Later, he started volunteering his expertise in photography, and has since been serving actively as an event photographer.
Apart from volunteering with the National Heritage Board, Billy also volunteers for the Singapore Red Cross Society during its road shows and blood donation drives. He helps the Very Special Arts (Singapore) with their art classes, music lessons, and speech-and-drama sessions for children. He finds working with children with special needs very meaningful, and is awed by the children’s expressions of their unique talents in various art forms.
Through shared experiences like these, he has made friends with other volunteers, with whom he often keeps in touch after the events. Billy finds that volunteering keeps him connected with what is happening in the world.
Challenging and fulfilling
The dim lighting conditions of a museum and not being allowed to use the flash, yet needing to capture that perfect fleeting moment, truly put his skills as a photographer to the test.
“My friends ask, ‘Why spend so much time taking a photo?’ They don’t know the most challenging part is concentrating, paying attention and trying not to miss any action. In events, things happen very fast. You really have to anticipate the next move — what’s going to happen next. You need to spend time preparing and concentrating. That’s how you capture a nice picture.”
Besides the technical challenges, what Billy really loves about volunteering is interacting with visitors both young and old.
“Sometimes, there are senior citizens on wheelchairs. They need extra care. It’s also challenging because many speak different dialects like Hokkien and Teochew. I only know Cantonese, and not too fluently. And so, usually end up speaking in Mandarin,” he explains with a rueful smile.
Despite the language barrier, Billy manages to connect with them. He is also grateful for the many foreign volunteers, for instance, from India and the Philippines who can communicate with visitors in their native languages.
Connecting with the past
One of his favourite places within the National Museum is the Singapore History Gallery. It showcases the living quarters of the working class in olden-day Singapore, life along the Singapore River, and stories of the forefathers of Singapore.
“It is the senior citizens who will relate their experiences to us, docents! They can relate with the exhibits and it brings back memories to them: carrying rice, going through hard times to feed their families... When you talk to them, they feel emotional about the past. Some of their stories are quite sad as their lives were very tough.”
“I learnt a lot in the process — we should be quite happy (with life) and not complain so much now. I also learnt more about the exhibits. The ACM (Asian Civilisation Museum) changes their exhibits often,” he explains. “We acquire new knowledge after every change!”
Joy in connecting
As a father to a grown son and a grandfather to a five-month-old baby, Billy has a soft spot for children. He finds interactions with young visitors especially endearing. He explains that the children are very curious and often make funny faces when he takes pictures. After photographing them, they clamour to look and get excited about the shots.
“Some will exclaim, ‘Wah, very nice!’ Sometimes, you will encounter very shy children. When you try to take their photo, they will hide from you. When I manage to capture a special moment and show it to them, they start to open up and interact.” He finds this heartwarming because breaking the ice and connecting with a stranger is probably not easy for them.
“I hope that when they see the photos, they will recall their time at the exhibition and remember this uncle. Maybe one day, they will also want to be a volunteer and give back to society.”
Own favourites
Of the pictures he has taken, some of his favourites include captured moments of funny gestures when children talk to one another and volunteers enthusiastically interact with children. He fondly recalls a tour of Little India with the young ones.
“Little India has very nice, colourful buildings. Volunteers were interacting with the children and showing them the five-foot way of pre-war shop houses. In the backdrop, there was a mural depicting the Indian vanishing trades: like the fortune tellers, dhoby men, flower garland makers... I took some nice shots there.”
Perhaps it was the contrast between a present moment against the backdrop of a nearly forgotten era that made the pictures especially poignant and nostalgic for him.
Billy continues to use his camera not just as an aesthetic tool or a means to chronicle history, but also as a bridge between himself and a younger generation. “As long as I am fit, I will continue volunteering. This is a good way to spend my time instead of hanging around aimlessly.”
To others considering volunteering, Billy has this to say, “When you volunteer, you need to come with an open mind. Don’t expect too much. Instead, see how you can help. After that, just enjoy the experience.”

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 4 – Oct to Dec 2010
Let us begin by asking ourselves a rather simple, if mundane, question: Why is it that when we survey the vast repertoire of batik styles and motifs we often come across certain patterns that are rather loud and crude in the manner they are rendered? And how come some of these patterns – such as the parang rusak or ‘broken sword’, which happens to be one of the ‘larangan’ (forbidden) patterns traditionally restricted to the royalty and aristocracy – were regarded as special and their use limited to the exclusive confines of the palace?

Numerous theories have been advanced to explain this discrepancy in style and taste, and this article does not in any way claim to hold the final answer to the riddle. However we propose that in order to answer the question we need to remind ourselves of what batik is and how it ought to be understood – and more crucially read – as more than just pieces of hand-waxed and painted cloth, but rather as narratives containing statements about the wearer of the batik and the world around him or her. Batik is, in short, a form of visual and textual narrative that can be read (after all, batik is written, remember1) and the answers to the questions that it poses before the eye of the modern viewer can be found in the material itself.
BATIK IN TIME, SPACE AND SOCIETY
First of all, let us situate batik in its proper historical-social context: Like language, batik was the lingua franca of the peoples of Southeast Asia and batiks produced in Java and Sumatra were eagerly bought and used by not only the Javanese and Sumatrans but also the communities of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sulawesi and other parts of the Malay archipelago.
However it is to Java that we need to turn to if we are to locate batik in its original setting where the motifs and patterns of the cloth are to be understood and deciphered properly. For it was in Java – particularly between the 18th and 20th centuries – where a highly complex and plural cosmopolitan society emerged that was internally differentiated along the lines of class, wealth, political status and loyalties, ethnicity, language and religion. And in this overdetermined social environment where symbols and markers were constantly being contested and in a state of flux that the motifs and patterns of batik were used as markers of identity and difference.
Elsewhere, we have talked about batik as a marker of ethnic, class, gender and religious identity. But in our attempt to understand and account for the variations of patterns and motifs, and why some were bolder and cruder while others were finer and softer, we need to understand the complex web of social relations and the social hierarchies that were dominant in Javanese society then.
For a start, let us go back to our first question above: Why is it that some of the restricted ‘royal’ patterns and motifs seem cruder than their socially inferior counterparts? Of course it beggars belief to suggest that the Rajas of Java could not afford the finest batiks of the land; and it goes without saying that the workshops and ateliers of the royal houses did produce some of the most sophisticated batiks of Central and Eastern Java. So, why were patterns like the parang rusak deemed preferable to kings, nobles and aristocrats?
THE FABRIC OF A COMMUNITY
Answering such a question necessitates some imagination on our part, and having to imagine how batik was worn, and where and why. The bane of batik research today is the dearth of enough photographic data to show how batik was used on a daily, routine basis by people from all walks of life. In many private and public photo collections, we see batik being worn by those who were clearly posing to be photographed, in situations and settings that were hardly natural.
Nonetheless some leap of faith and suspension of disbelief is required when we try to imagine how batik was worn in the days when it was the common denominator of kings and peasants alike. Living at a time when batik was literally the fabric that held society together and when its use was universal, we need to remind ourselves of the double-faced nature of batik as the universal cloth of Southeast Asia. On the one hand it was the textile that served as the material lingua franca of various communities, but on the other hand, the distinctions between classes, ethnicities, gender and localities had to be inscribed in that same material.
So, if kings and peasants alike wore batik, the only way through which the uneven differentials of power and status between them could be materially reproduced in the public domain was in the material itself, notably its patterns. And in the patterns of batik we may begin to understand the Southeast Asian understanding of the concept of social space, social hierarchy and social distance as well.
CLOSING IN ON AN ANSWER: THE EFFECT OF DISTANCE
Take a look at a sample of parang rusak below and you may see what I mean: When looked at closely, the motif – a simple, undulating repetitive pattern in a series of broken waves – seems rather crude compared to the sumptuous batiks of Pekalongan, Kedungwuni, Cirebon or Kudus. Some older pieces of parang rusak batik give the impression that they were crudely drawn, almost as if the waxing needle was moved by the hands of an infant playing with a crayon. But therein precisely lies our error: for one is not meant to look at a piece of parang rusak close-up, but rather from a distance, and a respectful distance at that.
Parang rusuk pattern batik waistcloth or jarit (detail). Mid-20th century, Yogyakarta, Central Java. Collection of the Asian Civilisations Museum.
Indeed, the intended visual effect of the parang rusak motif is only evident when viewed from a distance (of say, 10 meters or more) and not when it is held in our hands. The same batik which appears crude when held before our eyes has a more arresting effect when viewed from a distance, and this implies that it is meant to be seen from afar; in turn, this implies that spatial distance is part and parcel of the batik’s pattern and effect. This in turn tells us something about the person who wore it (a king or noble) and those who viewed it. From a respectable distance the effect of a parang rusak motif is striking: what appears as a crude representation of broken waves takes on the appearance of graceful undulations that exude order and regularity – precisely the intended effect of the cloth’s pattern and presumably the intended role of the ruling elite as well, who were meant to embody and perpetuate the order of Javanese traditional society.
By locating ourselves in the social milieu where batik was worn thus, we begin to understand the complex web of social relations that were crucial to the maintenance of order, social norms and values of this highly conservative and traditional society. It was not an accident that the parang rusak motif was the preferred motif of the aristocracy, in the same way that the mega mendung motif below was likewise the pattern of royal batiks at the court of Cirebon. Both motifs appear crude when viewed up close, but regal and solid from a distance.

Social distancing and the maintenance of social hierarchies were thus part of the function of batik in traditional Javanese society, and such batiks made sense to those who lived in the context of a traditional society where the repertoire of symbols would be available to those who understood how to decipher its hidden meaning.
Such sartorial restrictions – and the social norms and praxis that accompanied them – did not apply to the communities of the north coast where there were no royal houses to set and maintain the standards of society. And in such a milieu, batik motifs and patterns played an altogether different role as they were markers not of social distance but rather social proximity and familiarity.
THE PESISIR BATIKS: A REVERSAL OF SPATIAL AND SOCIAL RELATIONS
The north coast ports and cities of Java were somewhat different from the royal capitals of Central Java as they had initially been small coastal settlements that only later rose to prominence as a result of colonial rule, international commerce and the settlement of many diverse diasporic communities including Europeans, Chinese, Indians and Arabs. Here a different sort of batik emerged as a result of the melange of different cultures that came together within the ambit of colonial race relations and a different mode of social ordering that was the result of mercantilism and transnational linkages. In time the batiks of the north coast cities would become the norm for most Javanese who lived in the more modern and cosmopolitan urban centres and they would gain recognition from other colonial centres including Malacca, Singapore, Penang and as far as Manila and Bangkok.
The social order of these hybrid colonial settlements was entirely different from that of the royal capitals where social hierarchies were accompanied by their own mode of social distancing and spatiality. The absence of traditional values and norms, as well as the sartorial rules and regulations that maintained the social order in traditional Javanese society meant that the inhabitants of these hybrid cosmopolitan centres could mingle with relative ease and inter-ethnic and inter-religious marriages and relations were not uncommon.
It should also be added that the political economy of these coastal port-cities was dependent on international commerce and not the traditional agrarian based economic production model that was the norm in central and eastern Java. As such, the standards that dictated the hierarchies of class and status were somewhat different, and the notion of cultural capital – which often brings with it the weight of history and patrimony – did not apply as much in these new social settings. As many of the wealthier members of such coastal settlements were self-made millionaires whose fortunes depended on trade and manufacturing, social markers of distinction in such settings were more often determined by the markers of capital and economic largesse. The new elite in places like Kedungwuni, Pekalongan, Kudus, Surabaya, Indramayu and Jepara were the landed merchant classes; and in some places – like Kudus, the centre of the hugely profitable kretek (clove cigarette) industry – the wealthy merchants had plenty of money to spare on land, furniture, automobiles and of course batik.
MADE FOR A CLOSER LOOK
If traditional central Javanese batik established social distance and hierarchies through a repertoire of restricted patterns that were meant to be viewed at a respectable distance, no such scruples applied in the cities of north coast Java. The opposite seems to have been the case, with batik producers in places like Kedungwuni, Pekalongan and Kudus producing batiks of such intricate detail that much of the finesse and sophistication is lost to the naked eye when the cloth is viewed from any distance beyond an arm’s length. Indeed, one can only appreciate north coast batiks at their best when looking at them as closely as possible.
Let us compare two pieces of batik from the north coast of Java below. Seen from a distance of more than three metres, both tubular batik sarongs appear similar in appearance, composition and quality. The finery of the work and the detailed craftsmanship are lost when they are seen from a distance.

However, again we come to understand the meaning and value of such batik when we place ourselves in the same situational context in which they first appeared and were worn. Such batiks were made for women, and it has been established that social relations, networking and interaction among women in the colonial settlements were more relaxed than they were for Javanese women in the royal capitals. As such, one can imagine how and when such batiks were worn by the Eurasian, Chinese, Indian and Arab Peranakan women of the coastal towns; presumably during women-only gatherings like tea parties, lunches or the odd game of mah-jong.
It is precisely during such close encounters that the women of these Peranakan coastal communities would be able to stand literally next to their friends and/or rivals, and at close glance fully appreciate (or in some instances, envy) the elaborate details and ne workmanship of the batik worn by the person standing or sitting immediately next to her. One can only imagine the unstated tension and intense competition of batik aficionados who were determined to out-do their rivals at such gatherings, and the chagrin of the Madam who discovered to her horror that her sworn adversary had managed to get her hands on a priceless piece of batik from the workshop of Oey Soe Choen or Eliza van Zuylen! Such a discovery, however, could only be made up close, when both competitors were sitting eye-to-eye in front of each other...

THE DETAILS THAT MATTER
Now let us look at the two batiks again. The first happens to be a fine piece which was painstakingly hand-drawn with the aid of a canting, a wax pen used to draw ink onto the fabric (fig. 4a). The second is a run-of-the-mill batik from one of the many non-descript factories which churned out large volumes of batik for mass consumption, of standard value and presumably commanding a standard price (fig. 5a).

(fig. 5a) Detail of sarong
In an interesting inversion of the social rules of traditional Central Javanese society, the batiks of the north coast display an almost uniform character: despite the fact that they were produced in locations as far apart as Batavia (Jakarta) and Surabaya, the most common motif happens to be the somewhat static and monotonous buketan (bouquet) that was inspired by European oral motifs probably copied from children’s drawing books or fashion catalogues imported from the West. Yet the difference between these batiks lie not in their overall format and composition but rather in the rendering of the flowers, birds, bees and butterflies we see in them, rendered in varying degrees of detail ranging from the crude and elementary to the mind-bogglingly precise and microscopic.
This difference in detail in turn served as the benchmark whereby the value and price of such batiks were estimated and sold, with the most detailed pieces commanding the highest prices. Needless to say, in wealthy circles such as those found among the merchants of Batavia and Kudus – as well as Bantam, Singapore, Penang and Malacca – the most expensive batiks that were produced by the workshops of the Pesisir soon found a ready market and a happy home for themselves.
In summing up, we need to remember that batik has to be understood in the situational context in which it found itself, and that understanding the meaning and import of batik motifs and patterns requires some understanding of how batik was situated in extended spatial-social relations where it could perform the social function it had: as a means of establishing social distance and proximity, and a way of keeping everything and everyone in their place. No mean feat for a piece of cloth.
1 Batik is written in the sense that we write it with a wax pen canting, not painted with a brush. Also until today in parts of Java the word batik literally means to write, as in ‘batikin nama bapak dalam buku ini’.
Dr Farish A Noor is a Senior Research Fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, NTU; and has been collecting batik from all over Southeast Asia for more than a decade now. He is one of the co-authors of ‘The Spirit of Wood: The Art of Malay Traditional Woodcarving’, along with Eddin Khoo.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Frozen-in-Time-Time-Capsules-in-Singapore/story,"Time capsules are like buried treasure chests in which items are preserved for the future. When opened, these time capsules provide us with snapshots of the eras during which they were buried.
Time capsules come in many shapes and sizes, but they all contain items that the people and institutions of Singapore have chosen to represent themselves and their milestones. These items also represent the way that the makers of the time capsules hope to be remembered.
NHB’s Frozen in Time: Time Capsules in Singapore travelling exhibition in 2018 provided an overview of the history of time capsules in Singapore and offer interesting facts about some of these time capsules and their contents.
Watch: Frozen in Time: Time Capsules in Singapore 360 Video
In Singapore, many time capsules have been buried over the past 200 years, often to commemorate important events. These include time capsules buried during the colonial period, after Singapore’s independence and even in recent years.
Singapore’s oldest known time capsule was buried in 1843 and rediscovered by workers involved in the restoration of the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd. The capsule was found under the cathedral's foundation stone in 2016. Its contents reflected the diversity of the communities in Singapore even during the nation’s early years.
The restoration of the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd back in 2016.
The items from this time capsule are now on display at the cathedral’s heritage gallery. The gallery is open to visitors and also features other items which are of significance to the heritage of Singapore’s Catholic community.
One time capsule from the colonial era provides insights into life in Singapore just before World War II. It was buried on 1 April 1937 under the foundation stone of the former Supreme Court, which is now part of the National Gallery Singapore.
The date on which the time capsule was buried marked the 70th anniversary of the Straits Settlements (now Singapore and parts of Malaysia) as a British Colony separate from India. The former Supreme Court itself was a symbol for justice and the rule of law under the British.
The time capsule is scheduled to be opened only in the year 3000 with the smashing of the foundation stone. This seven-foot stone forms part of the floor in the former Supreme Court building and visitors can still see it at the National Gallery Singapore today.
During the early years of Singapore’s independence, a number of time capsules were launched. These time capsules contained items that symbolised the hopes of the young nation.
The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) created a time capsule focusing on Singapore’s industrialisation and buried it under the Jurong Town Hall in 1974. JTC then used the Jurong Town Hall as its headquarters until 2000.
Similarly, the Science Centre Singapore created a time capsule and buried it in 1973 to track Singapore’s progress over ten years. Among the 112 items inside the capsule were a black and white television, a camera and even samples of pig feed.
This capsule was opened and sealed again with more items in 1983, 2001 and 2013. The latest capsule is displayed in the Science Centre Singapore’s Kinetic Garden and will be opened in 2027 on the centre’s 50th anniversary.
National anniversaries are times of celebration and time capsules have often been part of the celebratory activities. Time capsules serve as milestones marking the nation’s progress, and are often buried or opened during these anniversaries.

25 Years of Nation-Building Time Capsule
In 1984, Singapore celebrated its 25th year of self-government. As part of the celebrations, a national exhibition was organised and visitors voted on 25 (out of 40) items that would go into a time capsule. This capsule was then buried in front of the Singapore History Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore).
The 25 Years of Nation-Building Time Capsule contained the following items:
    Singapore 2015 Time Capsule
In 1990, another time capsule was buried in the front lawn of Empress Place to mark Singapore’s 25th year of independence. This capsule contained 88 items that best symbolised Singapore’s achievements.

This time capsule contained the following items:

  More recently, during Singapore’s Golden Jubilee in 2015, or SG50, many organisations and institutions created their own time capsules. These contained items which were symbolic of Singapore’s history at that point in time, reflective of the Singaporean identity as well as representative of the people’s hopes for the country’s future.
The official SG50 time capsule can be seen at: www.sg/SG50/timecapsule
Post-SG50, time capsules continue to capture the public’s imagination and they are likely to endure as a popular means of commemorating important events and milestones in the present, for the future.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/a-game-of-thrones/a-game-of-thrones,"With great geographical benefits come great strife, as the power struggles between the 14th to the 17th centuries prove. The late 14th century saw Singapore being attacked. This compelled the Sultan to flee to Malacca, where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca, which Singapore became a part of. In 1511, Malacca fell to the Portuguese – the dominant European power in the region at the time – forcing its Sultan to retreat back south, where he established the Johor Sultanate. Singapore then fell under the rule of this Sultanate. In 1613, the Portuguese raided and burned the island to the ground, and for the next two centuries, Singapore faded into obscurity while still being nominally a part of the Johor Sultanate, eventually falling under regional Dutch control after the Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago.
When Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore with Major-General William Farquhar in January 1819, there were only about 1,000 inhabitants on the island, and they were greeted by a quiet that belied its eventful past. However, this did not stop Raffles from seeing Singapore’s potential – after all, he had heard so much about the place from his studies, and correspondence with Farquhar.
Sir Stamford Raffles
Fluent in Malay and having served as assistant secretary to the Governor of Penang at the age of 23, Raffles was familiar with the region’s history and culture, and eventually served as the Lieutenant-Governor of Java. He had also written a book, The History of Java. All this knowledge and understanding led him to strongly believe in the importance of breaking the Dutch monopoly of trade in the region.
This portrait depicts Raffles as youthful, confident and knowledgeable, surrounded by symbols of his scholarly work: the manuscript paper in his hand, a writing desk with paper, ink and quill, and sculptures from Java.The original painting by George Francis Joseph was made after Raffles returned to England from Java in 1816, where he had been Lieutenant-Governor. (c. 1912. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
As the Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, Raffles sailed to Penang after gaining permission to secure a post for the British East India Company, on the condition that he would not antagonise the Dutch, especially with the rising Anglo-Dutch tensions against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars. However, Raffles was met with a lack of cooperation by the Governor of Penang, and he also learned that the Dutch were claiming all territories under the Johor Sultanate. But there was still a chance to claim Singapore, since they had not yet occupied the island.
Despite receiving instructions from his immediate supervisor – the Governor of Penang – to abandon his quest and await further orders, Raffles slipped onboard the Indiana to reunite with Farquhar, and they arrived in Singapore on 28th January 1819.
The events that followed took place in quick succession – everything happened within ten days.
The succession dispute between Abdul Rahman and Hussein Shah
Upon their arrival, they found that Temenggong Abdul Rahman, the Governor of the Johor-Lingga-Riau Sultanate, was Head of the island. On 30th January 1819, the British and Temenggong Abdul Rahman came to a provisional agreement for the British to establish a trading post on the island. However, the area was under the charge of the Dutch and Bugis, who would never agree to a British base in Singapore. To prevent the Dutch from challenging the legality of this treaty, Raffles needed the endorsement of the Malay sovereign.
The reigning Sultan at the time was Tengku Abdul Rahman. Tengku Abdul Rahman was the second born son, and his older half-brother, Tengku Hussein Shah, should have been the rightful successor. However, Tengku Hussein Shah was away at Pahang at the time of the Sultan’s passing in 1811, which led to his younger half-brother, Tengku Abdul Rahman, becoming Sultan instead.
The hasty coronation ceremony to instate Tengku Abdul Rahman as Sultan before Tengku Hussein Shah’s return was organised with a politically-charged agenda by the leader of the Bugis faction, effectively aligning themselves with the Dutch. Tengku Hussein Shah remained in Pahang, clueless to these developments. He eventually found out, but with the Bugis faction now allies with the Dutch, and after being warned by the British in Malacca not to interfere in Riau-Lingga affairs, Tengku Hussein Shah and his supporters dropped all plans to challenge Sultan Abdul Rahman for the throne. Sultan Abdul Rahman was pressured to remain the Sultan despite his lack of interest and Tengku Hussein Shah went into exile in Riau.
Using the dispute
Aware of this dispute, Raffles struck a deal with Tengku Hussein Shah, knowing that this man had the support of the Malay chiefs in Riau and Pahang. It was a calculated move on his part, since Abdul Rahman was crowned by the Bugis faction that allied themselves with the Dutch, and this may have presented challenges in the negotiations for a British trading settlement in the region.
Raffles summoned Tengku Hussein Shah to Singapore, acknowledged him as the legitimate successor to the throne, and proclaimed him the Sultan of Johor. An official treaty was signed on 6th February 1819 with Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein Shah, which gave the British East India Company the right to operate a trading post in Singapore. This acknowledgement was beneficial for both the Temenggong and Sultan Hussein Shah. Both men were paid a handsome sum of money yearly to uphold this agreement.
This treaty was signed by Sir Stamford Raffles on 6th February 1819 with Temenggong Abdul Rahman and Sultan Hussein Shah, to give the British East India Company (EIC) the right to set up a trading post in Singapore. (c. 1819. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
Raffles left Singapore the next day and he instructed Farquhar to take care of this new settlement as its Resident and Commandant.
The Dutch strike back
Though the events leading up to the 1819 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance were tumultuous, they paled in comparison to the commotion caused once the Dutch in Batavia got wind of this new British development. The Dutch went on to challenge the legality of the settlement, stating that the island had always been within their sphere of influence. However, the British stood their ground as they had begun to recognise Singapore’s strategic value
This copper engraving illustrates a detailed city plan of Batavia (Jakarta), the Dutch capital of the Dutch East Indies. (c. 1660s. Image from Asian Civilisations Museum.)
As predicted, Singapore grew from a trading port to a trading settlement in the span of four months. Singapore became a regional gem – attracting traders, merchants and pioneers from all over.
The Anglo-Dutch Treaty
Though it took years for the Dutch and the British to see eye to eye, Singapore’s legal ambiguity was resolved in 1824 with the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty. This treaty recognised British influence over Singapore and the Malay Peninsula. It also officially acknowledged Dutch authority to the south of Singapore and in the Indonesian archipelago.
A map of the British Settlements in the Malay Peninsula and Coast of Borneo (c. 1870. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
It can be argued that this resolution came about due in part to Raffles – his act of acquiring Singapore took tensions to an all-time high and forced the relevant authorities to come to an agreement.
There would be other Anglo-Dutch treaties to come in the 1870s but for now, this chapter was closed.
Eventful and fast-paced, Sir Stamford Raffles played a key role in this significant turning point in Singapore’s history, though some of his methods could be viewed as questionable.

BeMuse Volume 6 Issue 3 - Oct to Dec 2013
The Asian Civilisations Museum displayed over 170 new acquisitions in the special exhibition Devotion and Desire: Cross-Cultural Art in Asia which ran until 8 December 2013. Objects acquired over 2009 to 2013 were mounted in the exhibition, most for the first time. Many of these works of art revealed the surprising connections between Asian cultures, and between Asia and the wider world. The exhibition highlighted a new direction for the museum, which had recently focused on collecting objects that have resulted from these interconnections.
The themes of the exhibition include the importance of trade, transmission of religions, courtly art, and colonial networks. For thousands of years, the cultures of Asia have traded, interacted, and exchanged ideas. These encounters have shaped our world, and they affect the way objects look. Religions moved from region to region, special objects were eagerly sought in lands far away, and new works of art were created by the blending of different traditions.
What is cross-cultural art?
Defining cross-cultural art is complicated. Trying to understand, through our contemporary eyes, why an object looks the way it does often requires a supple mind and a familiarity with various artistic traditions. Many works of art were made by people who lived a world away from their intended consumers – and, therefore, did not necessarily share a language, religion, or aesthetic. Meaning and context are generated in unexpected ways, with crucial roles played by traders, agents, and consumers of various types. Art historians sometimes try to pinpoint the earliest occurrence of a motif or style in order to identify the “original” source of influence. Although this may be a useful starting point, it can also obscure the influence of creativity by later artists.
Cross-cultural art can result from an artist using ideas and styles from a foreign culture in order to produce new work. Whether the process is called copying, borrowing, emulating, or appropriation is of no importance. What is important and exciting is the process – the exchange of influences, whether facilitated by networks of trade, migration, pilgrimage, diplomacy, or any combination of these – and, of course, the resulting works of art.
Devotion and Desire
Desire for wealth, hard-to-obtain commodities, adventure, and objects of beauty has driven trade and the movements of people for a very long time. Devotion to gods, principles, charismatic leaders, and indeed, craft and art-making, has been and still is a major driving force in civilizations around the globe. The objects in the exhibition are products of these forces, and tell fascinating stories of the past.
Peranakan art embodies this cross-cultural blending of ideas. As the descendants of foreign traders who settled and married local women, they adopted traits from their new home in the Malay world, while retaining much of their own culture, whether from China, India, or Europe. Peranakan art reflects diverse influences – it incorporates a complex mixture of styles and objects made in different parts of the world, which were commissioned or collected, and displayed together in a new context. The Peranakans provide an example for looking at the world: they remind us to look beyond the strict notions of nationality and ethnicity to discover the value of diverse communities.
Many regions around the globe have been sites of exchange and blending. As peoples and religions spread to new lands, new adherents incorporate local customs into new belief. A spectacular example is the monumental head of a bodhisattva (fig. 1). Both the style and the religious significance of the work can be traced to other lands: it is a Buddhist figure, made in a style borrowed from Hellenistic art. It was made in the ancient kingdom of Gandhara (in what is today northern Pakistan), an important crossroads between East and West. Like the Malay Peninsula, it was a point of exchange for trade, religion, and art.
Fig. 1. Head of a bodhisattva, Gandhara, around 4th century, Terracotta, height 85 cm.
Alexander the Great conquered parts of the Gandhara region in the 4th century BC. The state later transferred to the Indian Mauryan dynasty, whose King Ashoka (272–237 BC) converted to Buddhism. A succession of Greek and Bactrian rulers followed, until a long period of ability began under the Kushan kingdom (late 1 century until around 450 CE). These waves of influences left two profound effects on Gandharan art: Buddhism; and the realistic depiction of the human form influenced by Greek and Roman art – a mixture that gave rise to some of the earliest depictions of the Buddha and bodhisattvas.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Sikhism were all represented in works of art in the exhibition. Many of these objects are the result of varied artistic influence. For instance, Hinduism and Buddhism were transmitted from India to Southeast Asia in the first centuries of the Common Era. Imported ritual objects provided inspiration for local work, and Indian artists and merchants settled in towns along the trade routes and contributed to the creative process.
Three images of the Virgin and Child show varied responses to Christianity in Asia. A porcelain model made at Dehua, China, with a base of swirling Chinese-style clouds, melds elements of Guanyin with the Virgin Mary (fig. 2).

An ivory sculpture shows the extraordinary skills of Sri Lankan carvers who worked for both Christian and Buddhist patrons (fig. 3).
Fig. 3. Virgin and Child, Sri Lanka, late 16th century, Ivory, height 32.5 cm.
And a wooden Virgin and Child crafted in Timor-Leste is an example of a local artist’s interpretation of a Western sculptural style (fig. 4).
Fig. 4. Virgin and Child, Probably Timor-Leste, 19th century, Wood, pigments, height 73.7 cm.
The three sculptures all depict the same subject, but the stories of how they came to be are worlds apart.
Local religions dominate another section of the exhibition. In many cultures, ancestors are deeply respected and venerated. If properly attended to, ancestors would shower blessings upon the community and ensure bountiful harvests. In ancient China, vessels cast of bronze were used to offer food and wine during rituals dedicated to ancestors and the gods. Ritual vessels like a gui (fig. 5), richly decorated and exceptionally well preserved, were used by the elite. An array of impressive ritual bronzes was a display of power and prestige. These bronzes were often later buried in the tombs of their owners. Ancestor rituals not only showed respect but also emphasized the source of a ruler’s political authority.
Fig. 5. Ritual food vessel (Gui), China, Shaanxi province, early Western Zhou dynasty, late 11th or 10th century BC, Bronze, 22.1 x 27.6 x 18.6 cm.
The Austronesian peoples of Southeast Asia often represented their ancestors by producing figures made from wood, stone, or metal. Some are extremely simple – others grand and beautifully carved. A Hampatong guardian figure from central Borneo takes the form of a colonial-era soldier in Western- style military uniform (fig. 6). This shows that the Dayaks would even use powers from the world outside their community to ward off intruders from the spirit world.
Fig. 6. Hampatong guardian figure, Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), early 20th century, Ironwood, height 170 cm.
The desire to obtain money and goods through commerce has spurred the movements of people around the world for millennia. Much of the trade through the Indian Ocean centred around textiles from India and spices from Southeast Asia. A fine cotton textile (fig. 7), probably made for use as a bedspread or wall hanging, was produced on the Coromandel Coast of India. The bold floral patterns were popular in Europe at the time, and it was surely designed to appeal to that market.
Fig. 7. Hanging: Large flowers and cartouches, India, Coromandel Coast, early 18th century, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed, 277 x 170.6cm.
Porcelain and other goods from China were also coveted by much of the world, and for a time, the trade was strictly controlled. On display was a large bowl decorated with scenes of the lively waterfront at Guangzhou (Canton), the busiest trading port by the mid-18th century (fig. 8). Western trading companies were restricted to the “hongs”, as they were called, offices and residences abutting the port. Hong bowls like this were produced by Chinese artisans as souvenirs for wealthy foreign merchants.
Fig. 8. Hong Bowl, China, around 1785, Porcelain, height 15.5 cm, diameter 36 cm.
Luxury goods made from tortoise shell, ivory, mother-of-pearl, silver and gold – even exotic woods – drove markets for art in many places. A small chest covered with iridescent mother-of-pearl plaques mounted with silver pins was produced in Gujarat in western India (fig. 9). Collectors in Renaissance Europe were dazzled by such objects, which could be found in princely collections throughout the region.
Fig. 9. Casket, India, Gujarat, 16th or 17th century, Mother-of-pearl, wood, gilded silver pins, engraved metal mounts, 15.5 x 23.5 x 13 cm.
It is perhaps appropriate to return to Peranakan art to complete the circle. A full-length portrait painted in oil of Madam Wellington Koo embodies the shifting identities of Peranakans in the modern world (fig. 10).
Fig. 10. Portrait of Madam Wellington Koo, By Charles Tharp (British, 1878 - 1951), 1921, Oil on canvas, 197 x 100 cm, Gift of Lim and Tan Securities Pte Ltd in memory of Johnny and Nancy Lim.
Born at the turn of the century into a wealthy family in Java, Oei Hui-lan (1899–1992) grew up there and in Singapore, speaking multiple languages, and learning to negotiate the colonial society of the day. She married Wellington Koo, an American-educated Chinese diplomat, and they lived at postings in Europe and America. Madam Koo moved easily through high society in the East and the West. Featured in Vogue magazine, she was equally comfortable in haute couture or the sarong kebaya; the shops of Paris, or the dusty streets of Java. And thus, we might view her as another in a long line of adventurers, traders, and negotiators along the many paths that combine cultures around the world. These interactions can produce works of great beauty. Some of them were on display here in Singapore in the past exhibition at the Asian Civilisations Museum.

Be Muse Volume 6 Issue 2 - Jul to Sep 2013
Tucked way behind the borders of Singapore's shopping district is Tiong Bahru, a quaint and charming housing estate dotted with eclectic independent shops as well as eateries old and new. Popularly known for its food offerings and distinctive architecture, Tiong Bahru as become one of Singapore's most sought-after residences as many people have rediscovered in recent years the unique attractions of a laid-back, low-rise neighbourhood.
On 14 April 2013, the National Heritage Board (NHB) launched its 11th heritage trail to uncover the rich history and fascinating stories behind Tiong Bahru, which the public can now explore through a walking trail spanning the conserved housing area and its nearby surroundings. Tracing Tiong Bahru from its beginnings as an adjoining cemetery to a gravesite known as Teong Lama - literally 'Old Cemetery' - the trail sheds light on the social history and remarkable evolution of the estate, its unique Art Deco flats and shophouses, other landmarks past and present, as well as the people, trades, eateries and events that have helped shaped the community in Tiong Bahru.
FROM BURIAL GROUND TO BUSTLING DESTINATION
There is definitely more to Tiong Bahru than meets the eye. As the third public housing project developed by the Singapore Improvement Trust or SIT, Kampong Tiong Bahru, as it was known then, was transformed from a Chinese burial ground to a thriving residential estate. Today, there are no traces of he swamps, hills and graves that once dotted the area around Tiong Bahru Road from the mid-19th century until the 1930s, but many other aspects of the past can still be seen in and around the estate and are highlighted by informative storyboards and markers placed by these historic sites.
One hidden nugget that even regular visitors and residents may not have known about is an air-raid shelter located right under the flats of Block 78 Moh Guan Terrace. This vacant space, which was for a time used as a rubbish disposal site, was in fact the large public air-raid shelter in Singapore and the only on to be built as part of a public housing project. The shelter, dug in 1939, could accommodate up to 1,600 people but was seldom used as Tiong Bahru was not a major target for Japanese bombs during the Second World War.
Another oft overlooked historical site lies at the outskirts of Tiong Bahru along Outram Road, across the road from a petrol kiosk and Tan Boon Liat Building. Here, on a wooded hill long abandoned and ignored by passers-by, rest the remains of philanthropist Tan Tock Seng (1798-1850), his daughter-in-law Chua Seah Neo (d. 1882) and granddaughter-in-law Wuing Neo (d. 1882). The same hillock was also the location of a thriving Chinese-medium school called Gongshang, which operated at the site from 1930 till 1988.
Other former landmarks have vanished or changed beyond recognition. Visitors will learn from the trail about the history of a site at the junction of Seng Poh and Tiong Bahru Roads, where a small temple stood between 1918 and 2006. This Chinese temple was a major feature of the neighbourhood due to a large red hulu or gourd-shaped incense burner placed outside the shrine. Right across the road from the temple was a very popular bird corner that used to draw people from all over the island to listen to the songs of feathered pets as well as enjoy meals at a coffeeshop beside the bird corner.
The site of the former Seng Poh Road Market is also a very different sight from the past; the cramped old market has given way to a spacious food centre and wet market, where many stallholders from the older market continue to prepare and serve popular hawker fare such as fried kway teow, Hokkien prawn noodles, wanton mee, chwee kueh, porridge and traditional snacks. Visitors can read about the individual stallholders, their history and culinary specialties in a brochure that presents the Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail in detail, which can be accessed here.
These are just a few of the many highlights of the trail, which is designed to tell the story of Tiong Bahru and chart the milestones of its development in a way that reflects the spirit and character of the community, including the personal memories of present and past residents. To this day, the physical and social landscape Tiong Bahru is still evolving, as new residents, businesses and visitors arrive and interact with each other as well as older establishments. The conservation status granted to the housing estate, however, paves the way for a harmonious blend of the classic and contemporary, as new eateries and retailers move into the pre-war shophouses, injecting new life into the estate while retaining its old-world, understated nature.
GUIDED BY VOLUNTEERS AND STUDENTS
The Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail also marked a number of ‘firsts’ for the NHB, which is working to engage Singaporeans in documenting and sharing about the history of the places where people live, work and play. The trail was the first to feature guided tours conducted by volunteer guides on a regular basis for the public. Some of these guides are themselves residents of Tiong Bahru who were keen to share their own stories about the neighbourhood, as they have lived in the estate for many years. These volunteer guides underwent training sessions organised by the NHB and also conducted their own research on the estate. The tours have proven popular with the public; within three weeks of the trail’s launch in April, all sessions until August 2013 were fully booked.
The trail is also the first to be adopted by a school. Henderson Secondary, which is located not too far away from the estate, adopted the Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail for two years and used it as an education platform. Students also served as the NHB's ambassadors in promoting the trail to other schools. The NHB also organized training sessions for students who were keen to act as guides for their peers. The heritage trail offered students a creative avenue to involve themselves with local history and further their understanding of Singapore's past, while honing their research and leadership skills.
LAUNCHING THE TIONG BAHRU TRAIL
On the morning of 14 April 2013, the basketball court beside the Tiong Bahru Community Centre was turned into a site of festivities for the young and old, as a curious crowd explored colourful stalls, watched cultural performances put up by residents and enjoyed the privilege of being the first people to embark on the heritage trail. Volunteer guides, students and long-time residents led the guests through the estate, stopping at 10 markers and storyboards that showcase historical elements of Tiong Bahru and pointing out places and moments of significance. The launch of the trail was a day-long event of fun and celebration as residents and visitors alike gathered to celebrate the history and life of a com- munity with much to offer in stories and sights.
The Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail is a collaborative effort between the NHB, the Tiong Bahru Youth Executive Committee (TB YEC), and the Tiong Bahru Community Centre Management Committee. Launched in conjunction with a Tiong Bahru Heritage Fiesta organised by TB YEC, the event was graced by Guest-of-Honour Ms Indranee Rajah, in her capacity as Advisor to Tanjong Pagar GRC Grassroots Organisations. Approximately 1,000 people attended the event, including close to 200 invited guests and representatives of businesses and organisations located in the area, who were invited to walk on a modified trail route of the estate. As part of the tour, the guests had the opportunity to interact with Henderson Secondary students who were stationed at each heritage marker to introduce the guests to the site. These students had been trained by the NHB and conducted their own research to prepare for the launch. Their efforts certainly paid off as guests and students alike had an enriching time learning about the places they saw.
Many of the participants and guests also grabbed the chance to sign up for a guided walk of the trail. Two trail routes were available: one covered all ten heritage markers, while the other brought participants into the pre-war air-raid shelter at Blk 78 Moh Guan Terrace. With help from the HDB and Tanjong Pagar Town Council, the air-raid shelter was opened to the public for this special occasion. Adding a highly personal note to the tours were the volunteer guides, who shared their own research, experiences and stories with the participants.
Also at the launch to share her personal story was Ms Mary Pereira, who was born in the air-raid shelter at Moh Guan Terrace during an air raid in 1942. Ms Pereira’s mother was taking cover in the shelter during the war when she suddenly went into labour. Thankfully, the shelter was equipped with medical facilities and had a doctor on site to attend to her. Ms Pereira was thus safely delivered and has shared her story with many others over the years, including the guests on the trail.
Many visitors were clearly enriched by the tours. Expressing his thoughts after going for the guided walk, Anthony Loke said he “definitely learned more about the history and community activity in Tiong Bahru in addition to the architectural information.” Another participant, Karen Phan, remarked that the guided tours help to make “Tiong Bahru [a] living and growing museum.”
The day-long launch event culminated in an outdoor movie screening that relived the old times back in the 1950s when the Tiong Bahru Community Centre would organise open-air film screenings for the community. Earlier, various community groups had set up booths selling snacks, handicrafts and fashion by the community centre. Occupying a prominent space was a stall by Urban Sketchers Singapore, a group of avid and energetic artists who focus on drawing various outdoor locations in Singapore. The Urban Sketchers had collaborated with the NHB to conduct a sketch-walk along the trail, with individual artists seated at various spots where they could capture the mood and atmosphere of the estate in beautiful artworks that were exhibited during the trail’s launch. Paul Wang, a representative of the group, stated, “We the Urban Sketchers had a really good time sketching Tiong Bahru. The event was well-organised and we appreciate NHB’s hard work.”
Another touch of artistry at the event came from fashion designer Elyn Wong of Stolen, a Singapore-based womens-wear label. For the launch, Ms Wong had created a designer tote bag featuring Tiong Bahru’s distinctive Art Deco flats. The bags were sold during the Tiong Bahru Heritage Fiesta, with all proceeds going to the Tanjong Pager-Tiong Bahru Citizens’ Consultative Committee Community Development and Welfare Fund to assist needy residents. The money collected from subsequent monthly guided trails, which require a nominal fee of two dollars per participant, will also go into this fund.
ROUTES TO DISCOVERING THE HEARTLANDS
As with earlier NHB community trails, the Tiong Bahru Heritage Trail was launched with the aim of engaging Singaporeans to learn and share about the heritage of the heartlands, as well as to document the unique histories and social memories of places and communities in different parts of Singapore. These trails chart old trades, businesses, schools and institutions as well as the diverse communities that have shaped the character of each place. As part of this effort, the NHB also encourages the community to actively contribute to the making of these trails. The result is that these trails include many human interest stories shared by old residents or business-owners, which provide first-hand accounts of important landmarks as well as events and changes that have taken place over the decades.
Another mission of the trails is to encourage the public to explore Singapore’s heritage on their own, and at their own time and pace. Apart from the permanent markers and storyboards installed at major historical locations along the trails, the NHB has produced detailed brochures to accompany each heritage trail, which provide in-depth information about the neighbourhoods and sites of historical interest. Tiong Bahru is just one of many heritage trails launched by the NHB in recent years; other community trails cover places such as Kampong Glam, Balestier Road, Jalan Besar, Bukit Timah, Queenstown, Ang Mo Kio and Yishun/Sembawang. There are also heritage trails focusing on the downtown Civic District as well as sites of significance during the Second World War in Singapore. Together, these trails offer a fresh and exciting understanding of the Singapore Story.
The heritage trails serve not merely as channels to improve our knowledge about places in Singapore. They also provide a useful platform for heritage enthusiasts, researchers and schools to pursue further research into the history of particular places, peoples and trades. It is hoped that these trails will motivate the public to see Singapore’s history in a fresh light and discover more about the past in their own backyards, and in doing so, make history into a pursuit and passion that is continuous, alive and enriching.

Be Muse Volume 6 Issue 2 – Jul to Sep 2013
The first official census of 1824 recorded 756 Indians, 7% of the population of Singapore then. In just over a century, by 1931, the Indian population had grown to 50,000 people and continued to grow with time. The dynamic profile of Indian migrants included North as well as South Indians. The early migrants came as British troops or Sepoys, prisoners (political and otherwise) who contributed to Singapore’s infrastructure, traders, plantation workers, professionals and civil servants, policemen, and even as performing artists and craftsmen. These early migrants founded empires and institutions; inspired their community and others; and fought for their rights and beliefs. The increasing number of Indians also gave birth to several associations and organisations that served their agendas of religion, business and trade, arts and culture and even social reform. These organisations continue to be instruments of social bonding and cultural interaction till today.
The Indian Heritage Centre has been delving into this early history of the Singapore Indian community – in the absence of published records, oral history has been pivotal to curatorial research. The Somapah/Basapa family is a perfect example of this initiative.
These names were mentioned to me by every other member of the Indian community; he (Somapah) was a pioneer in the property business, they would say. The names kept returning to taunt me, yielding few returns to endless searches at various public archives. Until December 2011, when I found, quite by accident, a family history website created that year by the family of Thomas Augustine (T.A.) Basapa (1917-2010), following his demise. T.A. Basapa was the grandson of Hunmah Somapah (d. 1919) and the son of William Lawrence Soma (W.L.S.) Basapa (1893-1943). With names, context and places made explicit in the content of the website, the public archive search (which included the collections of the National Museum of Singapore, the then Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research and newspapers in Singapore) became more rewarding. I also managed to locate T.A. Basapa’s son Lawrence Basapa, who kindly agreed to be interviewed on the family’s history. Lawrence Basapa has since donated digital copies of photographs from the family album for display at the Indian Heritage Centre.
A part of my research findings are compiled below into a short narrative on W.L.S. Basapa (Hunmah Somapah’s son) and his passion for collecting animals, which led to his establishing of Singapore’s first private zoo as well as his contributions to the erstwhile Raffles Museum. Curatorial research on the Somapah/Basapa family forms part of the content for the Indian Heritage Centre’s permanent gallery on Indian Pioneers in Singapore. Please visit us at the junction of Campbell Lane and Clive Street to know more about this remarkable individual and other Indian pioneers in Singapore. The Heritage Institutions Division under the National Heritage Board has also produced a travelling exhibition on Singapore’s Early Zoo which features photographs and the history of the first Singapore zoo at Punggol. The exhibition was launched at the Singapore Zoo in April 2013 and travelled to three National and Public Libraries in Singapore.
W.L.S. Basapa: Pioneer and Collector
Hunmah Somapah was a landowner and municipal official. The Somapah estate owned properties in the Serangoon Road and Changi areas. Upon Somapah’s death, W.L.S. Basapa became a trustee of the Somapah estate and inherited his father’s residence at 317 Serangoon Road. It was at his Serangoon estate that he began, between the period 1920 and 1922, to collect several species of animals and birds.
To accommodate his growing collection of animals and birds, Basapa acquired 11 hectares of seafront land at Punggol. In 1928, he relocated his collection to Punggol and started the Singapore Zoological Gardens and Bird Park at Punggol (also known as the Punggol Zoo).
It took ten years for Basapa to transform the muddy and overgrown piece of land in Punggol into a full- fledged zoo. At the rate of S$35 per day, Basapa maintained the zoo privately from 1928 until the start of World War II. Basapa was a man of foresight who forged international connections to create the best displays at the zoo. For instance, Basapa imported a stunning black leopard (announced as a Black Panther in a 1937 Straits Times article) for the Punggol Zoo from Sydney’s Taronga Park Zoo in 1937. This was part of an animal exchange plan devised between the two zoos. He also brought in exotic animals from South Africa, America and Australia, and eventually built up a collection of 200 animals and 2,000 birds for the Punggol Zoo.
The zoo was a major attraction in pre-war Singapore and charged a nominal entrance fee of 40 cents. It even gave discounts of up to 75% off the entrance fee for students. In fact, the Punggol Zoo was known the world over, and even locally, as the Singapore Zoo – the first to be called so.
At the start of World War II, the British moved their forces to the North of Singapore in anticipation of the Japanese onslaught and occupied the site of the Punggol Zoo. Basapa was given 24 hours to vacate his animals and birds, and given the short time span, was unable to save all of his animals. The British freed the birds and harmless animals and shot the more dangerous ones.
During the Japanese occupation, the Punggol Zoo became the location for the Japanese mess, and Basapa eventually died in 1943, a broken-hearted man. The Punggol Zoo was not restarted by the Basapa family after the war.
In his lifetime, Basapa made periodic, almost annual, donations to the Raffles Museum between the years 1924 and 1938. These donations included animal skins and mounted specimens of animals that had died at Basapa’s home zoo at Serangoon Road and later at the Punggol Zoo. The Raffles Museum’s annual reports (in the collection of the National Museum of Singapore) mention Basapa’s generous donations to the Museum’s collection of zoological specimens. More than 80 specimens donated by Basapa were later inherited by the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (now Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, National University of Singapore) from the former Raffles Museum and are still part of the museum’s collection.

Milestones of the Punggol Zoo
According to contemporary newspaper articles, the famous physicist Albert Einstein visited Singapore in November 1922 to raise funds for a proposed Hebrew University in Jerusalem. His notes on this visit mentioned his passing through “Singapore’s Zoological Gardens”. This is possibly a reference to Basapa’s private home zoo located at 317 Serangoon Road.
Basapa’s Punggol Zoo was commended by Sir Roland Braddell in his 1934 book Lights of Singapore. Braddell also mentioned Basapa’s “magnificent collection of birds”, his orang-utans and a pet tiger named Apay that could be led around by a chain even though he was four years old.
In March 1930, the Punggol Zoo imported seals into the British colony of Singapore. This marked the first time members of the public could view these marine creatures in a public zoo.
A 1933 American film titled “Dyak” starring English actor M.H. Kenyon-Slade was shot at the Punggol Zoo. Kenyon-Slade was filmed fighting a dead python in a battle which was regarded as one of the high points of the film.
In February 1935, the newspapers reported that the Punggol Zoo had received several Arabian camels, black swans and Shetland ponies from the Perth Zoo. The following year, the Punggol Zoo produced advertisements to promote a café that served afternoon tea at the Zoo. The café was in fact an open-air “refreshment room” that served tea, biscuits and lemonade at a low price.

BeMuse Volume 3 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2010
Football is widely considered the most popular sport in the world. From 11 June to 11 July 2010, people of different nations and cultures were watching the FIFA World Cup – the most prestigious and anticipated football event in the world. The previous World Cup tournament held in 2006 drew and amazing viewership of 26.3 billion.
In fact, the appeal of football goes back thousands of years. Archaeologists have unearthed evidence of earlier versions of football played by ancient civilisations across the globe, including Ancient Rome, Greece and China.
Cuju was played by Chinese soldiers as part of their fitness training more than 2,000 years ago. It later became a favourite game of both men and women from the upper class of Chinese society.
Ancient Greeks and Romans of both genders played ball games to keep fit.
The ancient Mayans of Central America enjoyed a ball game which required players to hit the ball with their shoulders, arms, shins and hips. Sometimes, the ball was substituted with the head of an unlucky enemy.
However, modern football was first played in England in the 19th century. It is believed to have originated in public schools for boys as an extra-curricular activity to bring about discipline and foster team spirit.
THE MASS APPEAL OF MOB FOOTBALL
In medieval Britain and France, large-scale and often riotous ball games were popular with the masses. They were played by many players, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, with few restrictions. Divided into teams, the participants had to get the ball to its destination with their hands and feet. The unruliness of the games caused King Edward II (1284 to 1327) of England to officially ban them in 1314.
In 1477, King Edward IV (1442 to 1483) explicitly forbade the playing of football and other games as they were distracting the people from practising archery which was deemed a necessity in wars. Despite royal disapproval, mob football continued to be enjoyed by the people until the 19th century when a new version of the game emerged.
THE BIRTH OF MODERN FOOTBALL
British public schools in the 19th century catered to the aristocrats and the nouveau rich. The students harboured a sense of social superiority over the staff which sometimes made controlling them a nightmare. Compulsory games were introduced to bring about some discipline and divert the excess energy of the hormonally charged teenagers. Unsurprisingly, traditional football with its chaotic and boisterous nature became popular. Games were held to improve staff-student relations, forge school unity and promote the notion of putting the institution before oneself.
Each school had their own football rules that were at first passed down orally. The sport became more organised with the formation of houses, colours and contests. The first set of rules was written in 1846 at Rugby School in Warwickshire.
Former public school boys spread the game to Oxford and Cambridge when they entered university and promoted the sport in the army. Some even went on to set up their own football clubs, with each having their own rules. Some favoured a rugby style of playing while others forbade touching the ball with the hands. During matches, the first half of the game could be played under the rules favoured by one club while the second half would adhere to the rules of the other club.
Researchers have found that organised football matches were held outside the world of public schools as well. These games, which often involved betting, took place all over Britain.
In 1862, representatives of leading football clubs met to standardise the football rules. Those who preferred a dribbling version of the game set up the Football Association (FA) on 26 October 1863. Those who favoured a rugby-like version withdrew from the meeting and went on to form the Rugby Football Union in 1871. Football, as we know it today, became referred to as association football. The FA Cup, launched in 1871, is the oldest national football competition. Today, the rules of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board.
KICKING OFF EVERYWHERE
Football quickly found its place in rapidly industrialising Britain. Men from all social classes enjoyed it and played against one another. The football pitch became a legitimate venue for the working class to take a shot at the elite. Football had even begun to surpass the popularity of rugby. One of the reasons was that it was just as masculine but less rough than rugby. Young men simply could not afford to be absent from work due to injuries! Britons who travelled overseas, especially to parts of the British Empire, brought the game with them. As the popularity of football grew, particularly in Europe and South America, other countries began to set up their own football associations.
BIRTH OF THE WORLD CUP
In the early 1900s, some national football associations wanted to create an international body to discuss the future of football. They were interested in organising an international football competition. As a result, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, was formed in 1904. Its founding members were France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
Jules Rimet (1873-1959): The longest serving President of FIFA, having headed the organization from 1921 to 1954. The French lawyer is credited as the man who made the World Cup a reality.
FIFA held the first World Cup in Uruguay in 1930. Since then, FIFA has organised a World Cup tournament every four years, with the exceptions of 1942 and 1946 due to World War II. The 2010 World Cup attracted a record 205 national teams in the preliminary rounds, with 32 countries vying for the crown in the finals in South Africa.
This set of special velvet stamps was issued by Singapore in 2004 to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of FIFA.

FOOTBALL IN SINGAPORE
In the late 19th century, the British in Singapore formed sporting clubs and regularly competed against one another. The first football match recorded on the island was played in 1889 by British engineers at a pitch in Tank Road. The game was subsequently introduced to British subjects and students in British schools, before it became a favourite sport among the locals.
A predecessor of the Football Association of Singapore, the Singapore Amateur Football Association (SAFA) was registered in 1892. Formed 29 years after the Football Association in England, it is possibly the oldest football association in Asia. The SAFA held the first Singapore Football League in 1904. The early football scene in Singapore was dominated by Europeans. But by the 1920s, local teams such as the Singapore Chinese Football Association and the Singapore Malays Football Association began to make their mark. They often competed with overseas teams to packed stadiums. Once, the best players from both associations literally brought the house down when they beat Australia 4-2 at Anson Road Stadium.

""Singapore’s passion for football never waned, even when the threat of war loomed. In 1941, the island’s team beat Penang to clinch the Malaysia Cup for the fourteenth time. The Malaysia Cup was one of the most anticipated football competitions in Singapore. It was started in 1921 as the Malaya Cup by officers of the British battleship, HMS Malaya. Many Singaporeans still remember the days when the whole nation would put aside whatever it was doing to cheer for the national team, fondly called ‘the Lions’.""

However, 1994 was the last year Singapore won the Malaysia Cup. In 1995, Singapore’s football administrators withdrew from the tournament to focus on developing its own league. This did not sit well with local fans. Nevertheless, the S.League was born in 1996. As of 2010, 12 teams, featuring a mix of local and foreign talents, vie for the S.League title.

The football superstar has ventured where no Singaporean has gone - in 1982, he was offered a place at Ajax Amsterdam, the club of the legendary winger Johan Cruyff. He signed on with Dutch club FC Groningen from 1983-1985 and has also played with Indonesia's Niac Mitra and the Kuala Lumpur Football Association, helping the team win the Malaysian Cup three years in a row from 1987-1989.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city/becoming-a-cosmopolitan-port-city,"After Sir Stamford Raffles set up Singapore as a port, it quickly became a hotspot in the region. Trade took place in massive volumes, trade houses were built, and the culture of various communities started to take root here.
The increase in trade saw Singapore’s population grow more than ten-fold in just three years, exceeding the 10,000 mark by 1822. The migrant population had origins across Europe, China, South Asia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This surge in numbers, along with the mix of cultures on the island, led to land being used unsystematically, which strained the availability of space on the island.
Singapore’s changing landscape
The Padang was a designated government area, but had houses and godowns erected on it because the Europeans and the Asian merchants preferred to set up their homes by the banks of the Singapore River. The colony, in short, was becoming disorderly and drastically different from Raffles’ original vision for the island.
This is a view of the Telok Ayer Bay (mid-late 19th century), an area set aside by Stamford Raffles for the Chinese community in 1822. In this photograph, two iconic structures could be seen in the distance— the old Telok Ayer market by the sea and the Thian Hock Keng temple to the left. The temple, which still stands today, was built by early Chinese immigrants in gratitude to the deity Mazu for their safe passage across the seas. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
Raffles was dissatisfied with Farquhar’s leadership and immediately set into motion plans to clean up the colony. In 1822, Raffles formed a Town Committee with the help of the colony’s engineer and land surveyor, Lieutenant Philip Jackson, to tackle the situation. From his personal observations of other colonial towns, such as Georgetown in Penang, he knew that a formal town plan had led to the successfully integration of Indian and Chinese immigrants. This was the solution he settled on, as it prevented groups from developing separately and creating haphazard settlements.
The Jackson Plan
The Raffles Town Plan (1822), drawn up by Sir Stamford Raffles and Lieutenant P. Jackson, together with a Town Planning Committee was aimed at curbing disorderly growth of the settlement.Using the Singapore River as a natural boundary, functional and ethnic zones were marked out. The North Bank was reserved for government use, the South Bank for finance and commercial use.The Plan also included clear instructions on the layout and design of new buildings, shophouses and streets, for example the five-foot walkways and right-angled junctions. (Image from National Archives of Singapore.)
The town plan, titled “Plan of the Town of Singapore”, also known as the Jackson Plan, was published in 1828. It focused on the development of the area around the Singapore River, from Telok Ayer to the Kallang River.
Adopting features from colonial urban planning in British India, Raffles set up the seat of government in Fort Canning, similar to Calcutta’s fort-based layout. Raffles introduced ample greenery in the form of the Padang and the Botanic Gardens to give the impression of prosperity. It was also perhaps Singapore’s first step as a “Garden City”.
Despite the failure of nutmegs at Orchard Road, there was still much interest in horticulture amongst wealthier residents in Singapore. This led to the formation of another Agri-Horticultural Society in 1859. The society’s members wanted to establish a botanical garden where they could enjoy flowers and other plants in a pleasant landscape. One founding member of the society was the prominent merchant Hoo Ah Kay, also known as Whampoa, who helped to secure a location for a botanical garden at Tanglin. This garden would later develop into the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
Guided by pragmatism, Raffles also introduced a variety of features through the town plan which are still visible on the Singaporean landscape today. He moved Telok Ayer Market to where it is today so that it would be in the centre of the commercial district. Meanwhile, burial grounds were pushed much further inland. He mandated continuous sheltered walkways – also known as five-foot ways – meant to protect pedestrians from the hot tropical sun and rain. He also ensured that buildings were constructed with masonry and roof tiles, to reduce fire outbreaks for accessibility and safety.
But perhaps his most impactful mandate was the push for uniform and regular streets. He was so precise that he called for right angle intersections, indicated a minimum width for pavements and a minimum spacing in between buildings. This gave Singapore its almost grid-like layout in the heart of the city today, as evidenced by the Jubilee Trail.
Impressive features and construction works aside, the plan was ultimately created to facilitate trading and promote communal harmony.
Every community would have a space to call its own.
The city was split according to residential, commercial or civic usage. There was also further segregation based on people’s provinces and the type of residency among citizens and merchants.
Land segregated for different communities
The Government was allocated the area stretching from Fort Canning to the Singapore River. The sea beyond the Padang (labelled “Open Square” on the Jackson Plan) was also reserved for Government use. However, some places like the Old Parliament House had to be acquired by the government as it was originally built as a private home, and some other European merchants had already built houses within this area.
This stretch of Bussorah Street near Masjid Sultan was once known as Kampong Kaji (Pilgrim Village), kaji being the Javanese pronunciation of haji (pilgrim) as there were many Javanese living here. Until the mid-1970s, Singapore was the pilgrim hub in Southeast Asia, and pilgrims from nearby countries – in particular, Indonesia due to Dutch restrictions on the pilgrimage – would come to Singapore and stay at Bussorah Street while waiting for the kapal haj (pilgrim ship).
The seafront east of the cantonment to the southwest bank of the Singapore River was largely reserved for Europeans. Its actual occupants were European traders, Eurasians and rich Asians. There were also spaces for merchants in the area. When combined with the south bank of the Singapore River, reserved for commercial use, this area makes up the modern day Downtown Core.
And as its name suggests, Chinese Campong (present-day Chinatown) was reserved for the Chinese, and they were allocated a large area southwest of the Singapore River. This was where Chinese laborers of different professions, such as samsui women, Chinese letter writers and wood carvers would reside.
Indians were allocated land further up north from the Chinese in a place called Chulia Campong, but they would find themselves moving to another point north of the river. It was at this spot where a booming cattle trade saw cattle pulling bullock carts across the streets. This is Little India today.
The postcard depicts the junction of Chulia Street and the northwest corner of Raffles Place which was dominated for many years by the Bonham Building on the right. Chulia Street was originally known as Kling Street as large numbers of Indians from Southern India known as 'men from Kalinga' or 'orang kling' in Malay had congregated in the area. It was renamed Chulia Street as the term 'kling' adopted a deragotary association when Indian convicts were transported to Singapore. Chulia is the North Indian term for the Kalinga kingdom. c. Early 1900s. Image from National Museum of Singapore.)
For the Malays, the plan focused on the area around the Sultan’s residence for Bugis and Arab migrants. The area was, and is still, known as Kampong Glam, and its development resulted in the creation of three distinct parts - an area for the Sultan, one for the Bugis settlers and another for the Arab merchants.
Sense of community
The legacy of the Jackson Plan can still be seen on our maps today through the representation of the different ethnicities and ethnic quarters of the island, in areas such as Chinatown and Little India. Singapore is no longer divided by ethnic enclaves. What we have today is the organic mixing of communities, by the people who decided to make Singapore their home.
But the Jackson Plan still represents the essence of Singapore – a cosmopolitan port city where people of different communities, ethnicities and religions come together to live, work and seek opportunities for a better life.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/cinemas-over-the-years/story,"TL;DR
Going to the cinema today is a state-of-the-art audiovisual experience, complete with spacious, comfy seats, and a buffet of snacks for us to choose from. But it wasn’t always like this. No one in Singapore knew what a cinema was until 1902, when Basrai, a Parsi showman, set up the first outdoor film screening tent on a field along River Valley Road.
The gypsy cinema arrives in Singapore
Basrai was a travelling showman of the Parsi origins. In 1902, he arrived in Singapore with a tent that would change the country’s entertainment scene forever. Set up at the junction of Hill Street and River Valley Road, his cinema was the first ever to screen a public film here. The entrance fee was 10 to 50 cents, and films were projected onto the screen using limelight.
The first films shown included Miroir deCagliostro (Cagliostro’s Mirror), Le reve d’unastronome (Astronomer’sDream), and Photographing a Ghost. Although the visual effects and cinematography was vastly different by today’s standards, the tent cinema was a huge hit for the two years following Basrai’s arrival.
Singapore’s first enclosed cinema
In 1904, the tent cinema saw a new rival on the scene. The Paris Cinematograph, started by French entrepreneur Paul Picard, was Singapore’s first enclosed cinema in the Malay Theatre at Victoria Street. He screened hour-long pictures and played music to accompany the silent films. Back then, a third-class seat costed 10 cents and a reserved seat was 50 cents.
Our next big star… Sound!
It wasn’t until the 1920s that the first-ever ‘talkies’ (films with sound) arrived in Singapore. Naturally, it took Singapore by storm, and amusement park cinemas started showing popular American, British, Chinese, and Hindi films, which captivated huge audiences. This era gave birth to the Oriental Theatre at New Bridge Road and Majestic Theatre at Eu Tong Sen Street. Today, you can still find the preserved facade of the Majestic Theatre, right next to Chinatown MRT Station.
The cinema craze did not die out even when the Second World War arrived on our shores. As Singapore ushered in the 50s, even more players came into the picture. In 1952, Cathay Cinema became one of the first to screen a full-length 3D movie, Bwana Devil. The devil that popped out from the screens took every moviegoer’s breath away.
If you have watched a movie at one of the older cinemas, you’d have probably noticed that the screen also came with a significantly spacious stage. Cinemas during those days were also equipped for live shows such as musicals, magic shows, beauty contests, variety shows, and dance performances.
In the 1970s, Asia’s largest drive-in cinema that could accommodate 900 vehicles also opened in Jurong. c. 1971. Image courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.
Capitol Cinema was Shaw Organisation's flagship cinema after they purchased the Capitol building (later renamed Shaws Building) from the Namazie brothers in 1946. The tenancy of the building was returned to Singapore government in 1980s. c.1950s. Image courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.
Running the show until today
The industry’s boom led to many bigger players in the world of cinema to establish their presence in Singapore. Some of these have survived the changing eras, and film buffs today continue to enjoy big-screen entertainment at one of their cineplexes. Here are some you might already know:
View of Shaw House (right) and Lido Cinema from Orchard Road, Singapore. c.1969. Image courtesy of the National Archives of Singapore.
Shaw Brothers, a film group set up by brothers Run Run and Run Me Shaw, owned more than 100 cinemas in Southeast Asia and had the biggest cinema empire in Singapore in 1965. Their 19 cinema halls were located across the island, and another 30 cinemas licensed to play the movies they exclusively distributed. They also opened REX cinema at Mackenzie Road, a popular spot for foreign workers.

Cathay Organisation’s founder, Loke Wan Tho, hailed from one of the wealthiest families in Malaya, and instead of carrying on the family business, he decided to produce movies and own cinema chains, a wise decision that brought the organisation its continued success until today.
Eng Wah, also a Malayan native, set up a cinema at the Happy World Amusement Park with a friend. It was renamed Victory Theatre and survived the war by screening Japanese propaganda films. He continued his expansion to more cinemas and set up Eng Wah Theatres in 1968, bringing in numerous Chinese movies from Hong Kong and Taiwan. It has since rebranded itself as WE Cinemas.
Golden Village is a relatively new player. A joint venture by Golden Harvest (Hong Kong) and Village Roadshow (Australia), it began operating in the early 90s and now owns 11 multiplexes and cineplexes in the country.
Filmgarde Cineplex is the latest addition in the line of high rollers. Established in 2007, this independent cinema offers films of other genres aside from the blockbusters, with the aim of cultivating a community of film lovers in Singapore.

Cinema now, and beyond
Over a century has passed since the tented cinema debuted with its first screening in Singapore. The cinemas today not only face fierce competition from one another, the films they show must also outshine the huge selections from online streaming services.

That’s why independent venues such as The Projector, The Arts House, Alliance Francaise Cine Club, The Screening Room, The Substation, and Moving Image Gallery at SAM @ 8Q, offer unique genres of carefully curated films that are otherwise less accessible to the mainstream moviegoer.
From tented cinema to today’s indie art house theatres, the journey of Singapore’s big screens will continue to grow and evolve. What’s going to happen to our cinemas in the future? Let’s watch on.

Made popular in Shanghai in the 1920s, the ubiquitous cheongsam no longer invokes an image of an older generation in a bygone era who wore it for practical and functional reasons. Through the years, the cheongsam has evolved together with social, economic and political landscapes. It is now donned throughout the world, from silver screen sirens and female political figures to women from all walks of life.
In a fitting tribute to this iconic dress and how its evolution parallels the changing social roles of Singaporean women, over 150 pieces of cheongsam were put on display at the National Museum of Singapore from 28 March to 27 June 2012. Titled In the Mood for Cheongsam: Modernity and Singapore Women, the exhibition examined the rise of the modified cheongsam in modern Shanghai, its evolution, its introduction in Singapore during the 1920s and fascinating stories of iconic Singapore women who made the cheongsam their outfit of choice through the decades. These women include the wives of Singapore’s former political leaders such as the late Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, the late Mrs Benjamin Sheares, the late Mrs Wee Kim Wee and influential female icons such as Mrs Elizabeth Choy, Datin Aw Cheng Hu and Mrs Christina Loke. The exhibition also featured the late legendary Hong Kong actress Lin Dai's personal cheongsam collection.

The exhibition was categories into six sections: (1) The Origins of the Modern Cheongsam, 1920s; (2) The Cheongsam in Singapore, 1920 to 1940s; (3) The Golden Period of Cheongsam in Singapore, 1950s to 1960s; (4) Personal Wardrobes; (5) The Power Cheongsam; and (6) Modern Interpretation of Cheongsam.
THE ORIGINS OF THE MODERN CHEONGSAM, 1920s presented the modernised cheongsam as worn by the educated elite. The style in the 1920s signified a period of liberation, with the burgeoning of new ideas and thoughts on the role of women. The cheongsam of the 1920s was loose; the sleeves were wide; and the overall look, simple.
The collar, sleeves, front flap and edges of this garment are embellished with machine-made trimmings, which help to accentuate the form. As the bolt is not wide enough, two pieces of fabric were joined at the centre to make this garment. The tailor had to skilfully match the patterns on both pieces of fabric to ensure that the design is symmetrical. This outfit has no slit on the left side and a press stud at the bottom can be seen if it is opened fully.

This is an example of a late 1920s cheongsam with long and narrow sleeves made of silk damask with cloud motifs. One side of the cheongsam is secured by simple knotted buttons. Its loose silhouette is similar to the changshan, the long robe worn by men. This cheongsam is one of the oldest pieces in the National Museum of Singapore’s collection.

THE CHEONGSAM IN SINGAPORE, 1920 TO 1940s saw a stronger sense of modernisation and the embrace of western fashion concepts such as narrower and shorter sleeves, the use of imported fabrics such as silk crepe, georgette and chiffon, as well as the use of geometric, floral and Art Deco motifs.
In Singapore, the cheongsam, which was associated with modernity, was a popular garb for teachers, wives of wealthy businessmen, young girls, and the Peranakans.
This is a typical example of a 1930s cheongsam, made of fabric printed with geometric patterns from the Art Deco period. The use of such fabrics was extremely popular in Shanghai during the 1930s and reflected the rising influence of Western trends in the cheongsam. The sleeves and body of the cheongsam were made from one piece of fabric. The cut is relatively slender and narrow at the waist compared to the loose-cut cheongsam of the 1920s. The sleeves are not only shorter but also narrower, suggesting the effort to highlight the curves of the female form. There is a slit on the left side, and a full opening on the right. The collar, cuffs, front flap and hem are adorned with piping and binding that complement the colour of the fabric. Blue and white knotted buttons embellish the high collar.

This 1930s cheongsam, made of imported silk crêpe with floral embroidery, was worn by a bride on her wedding day. As the cheongsam is translucent; it is paired with a slip of scalloped edging underneath. The use of lightweight, imported fabrics for cheongsam in Shanghai and Singapore showed a shift in the nature of the garment from traditional to cosmopolitan.

THE GOLDEN PERIOD OF CHEONGSAM IN SINGAPORE, 1950s TO 1960s represented the evolution of the cheongsam to a popular everyday wear for working women, showing a significant shift in the identity of women from the traditional home-maker to the modern working female due to the country’s changing political, economic and social climate after World War Two.
This cheongsam collection features a nipped-in waist which became popular in the West after the Second World War. Darts on the bust and waist of the cheongsam help to take in excess fabric and accentuate the figure of the wearer.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Christine-van-der-Ven-Heritage-Volunteer/story,"“Don’t get too caught up with the historical figures’ personalities! Study the facts and dates too,” Christine van der Ven’s history teacher used to chide her back in her teens at school.
Christine certainly learnt that lesson well. Her vast knowledge was undeniable as she effortlessly peppered her National Museum of Singapore tour with precise dates and details from start to finish. Her fascination with the rich and colourful personalities of historical characters has clearly not waned.
“Did you know, David Marshall only wrote with a green pen?” she asks a group. This is just one of many fun facts Christine has at her fingertips, keeping visitors engaged with rich and vivid details that they would never have been able to glean from reading the museum labels.
Vivid scenes and stories
Whether it was Raffles, Farquhar, rickshaw pullers or Chettiars, Christine paints such vivid and compelling pictures of their lives that visitors feel, for a moment, they are in those people’s shoes.
Sitting in a mock-up of a typical living room belonging to a Chettiar from Tamil Nadu decades ago, Christine describes the minute details of his everyday life. She walks visitors through everything –– the tools he used, how he might have sat at his workstation, how to decode the scribbles in his journal.
A charming raconteur, Christine shares stories of Singapore’s history as if they were her own. She has been a docent for 20 years, frequently holding tours not only at the National Museum, but also the National Gallery, Peranakan Museum, and more.
Christine’s years of experience and close relationship with the National Museum –– her very first museum –– allows her to tell wonderful personal anecdotes about it.
For example, the National Museum houses a beautiful gold armlet from the 14th century which bears a plaque of repoussé work depicting the Javanese kala. The kala motif is a protective symbol, found at the entrance of Javanese temples dating from the 8th to 14th centuries. Christine shares that during a major renovation, the armlet was kept in a temporary display location where a fire broke out. Rumour had it that the sacred kala was not happy to have been moved to the temporary display! Thankfully, there have been no further calamities since it found its permanent exhibit in the newly refurbished National Museum.
Moving through a section on William Farquhar, Christine teaches the correct pronunciation of “Farquhar” –– “fah-ker”. This came as a surprise to many in the tour group, who had been saying it wrongly all these years. Christine herself had only learnt how to pronounce it accurately at the National Museum.
Still as exciting
The training docents have to undergo is very rigorous, requiring a high level of commitment. “But it’s all worth it”, she shared. “It’s very rewarding.”
For Christine, two decades of giving history tours has not dulled her experience one bit. Each tour she conducts continually informs and enriches the next, and even across different museums.
“It’s never the same tour, twice,” explained Christine. Fresh information she learns at a new Asian Civilisations Museum exhibition, for example, equips her with new stories to tell on her tours at other museums. Furthermore, she takes care to tailor each of her tours to the demographic of her group. Attendees are so varied –– tourists, elderly, young children, secondary school students, the list goes on. Christine always tries her best to focus on details and fun facts that her listeners might identify with and find interesting.
Asked if her friends and family share her enthusiasm for history or volunteering, Christine laughs and says, “Most of them think I’m weird, putting in so much work for free!” But, the friendships Christine has forged with fellow docents is priceless because that brings her happiness and fulfillment, day in and day out. Many of Christine’s co-volunteers have become travel buddies and lifelong friends, and she is very grateful to have found fellow enthusiasts who share her passions. “We’re history nerds together,” she chuckles. “We never run out of things to talk about.”

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 2 – Apr to Jun 2011
A recent edition of BeMUSE1 featured a painting by Pu Ru 溥儒 (1896-1963) titled A Copy of the “Beauties on an Outing” by Li Gonglin from the Asian Civilisations Museum collection (Fig.1).
Fig. 1. Pu Ru (1896-1963), A Copy of the ""Beauties on an Outing"" by Li Gonglin, Undated, 37 x 718.5cm. Collection of Asian Civilisations Museum. Gift of the Tan family in memory of their late father, Dr Tan Tsze Chor.
Apart from its intrinsic beauty, the work epitomises a key feature of Chinese painting, which is a reverence for the past through the act of copying. As its title suggests, the painting is based on a work attributed to an earlier artist, Li Gonglin 李公麟 (1049-1106), from the Song dynasty.2 Li's work is also similar in composition and style to another painting, possibly done by the Song emperor Huizong 徽宗 (r. 1100-1126) who had in turn copied a now-lost work of Tang dynasty artist Zhang Xuan 张萱 (713-755)!3
A colophon was later added to Pu’s painting by scholar Rao Zongyi who pointed out that Pu was mistaken in thinking that the subject he chose was of a concubine leaving the court. According to Rao, the depicted scene is actually Lady Guoguo’s Spring Outing. The original painting by Li Gonglin is in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and can be used for verification (Fig. 1a).

The Tradition of Copying
Copying is a common method of art training in many cultures. This is especially so for the ancient tradition of Chinese painting also known as maobi hua 毛笔画 or shuimo hua 水墨画. The tools used for such paintings (ink and colour pigments applied with a brush on paper or silk) have remained largely unchanged over 3,000 years.
In China, copying is a commonly accepted means of learning painting and calligraphy. As early as the sixth century, Xie He 谢赫 had mentioned the copying of old masterpieces as one of the Six Laws or Principles of Chinese painting aesthetics.4 Closer to our time, there is a well-known episode in the 1940s when Zhang Daqian and Xie Zhiliu spent nearly a year to document the Dunhuang cave murals in Gansu province by painting life-size reproductions. Interestingly, the murals themselves were also the result of copying in ancient times. The paintings’ outlines were initially produced through stencils. Relying on these stencilled outlines, Dunhuang artists then painted the final images directly on the walls. Zhang Daqian’s remarkable copying skills have given rise to a number of enduring controversies. One of the most prominent is the case of The Riverbank – a painting attributed to the 10th century master Dong Yuan by its owner, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, but which some recent scholars have suggested is a modern fake by Zhang.5
In Chinese painting, a beginner usually learns by copying his teachers' brushwork and composition, and from studying extant masterpieces, reproductions and instruction manuals. Once he has attained a sound foundation, he is then expected to develop a personal language that is a synthesis or reinterpretation of past styles, and one that reflects his personality, temperament and character. This is not to say that Chinese artists do not observe nature or are inept in capturing physical likeness. For them, studying nature is a key ingredient in art, but copying is a proven method of studying how earlier artists translated the physical form and, more importantly, the spirit of the three-dimensional world onto the two-dimensional surface of a painting. Moreover, in an era when mechanical reproduction was not yet available, making hand-painted copies was the only way of circulating widely admired works amongst artists and collectors. For instance, Su Shih 苏轼 of the Song dynasty was known to have lent old paintings to friends who wanted to have copies made.6 Sometimes, artists even created copies as a joke or to test their friends’ knowledge. And in a society where much respect is accorded to seniority and ancestry, artists have long been regarded as custodians and transmitters of culture and tradition. Hence, creating a work that refers to the past, especially the styles of great masters, signals an artist’s intent to be included as part of an illustrious lineage. In this way, making copies of paintings is seen as an exercise in virtuosity by artists who revere history. Pu’s painting, with its declared connections to antiquity, is a clear example of such aspirations.
Generally, there are three ways to make copies. The first is to make an exact copy by tracing an existing work (known as mo 摹). This ensures that the entire composition and scale are reproduced very closely. However, because tracing has to be done slowly, the final brushwork may lack fluidity and a sense of spontaneity. The other way is to make a freehand copy by studying the original closely (known as lin 临). In this more technically demanding method, the artist has more freedom in his brushwork, but an exact copy is virtually impossible. The third category of ‘copy’ paintings refers to works done in the style of a particular artist but not based on any specific painting. For such works (sometimes known as imaginary copies), an artist creates a new composition in the style of another. In the hands of a skilful artist, it is possible to get a good copy very close to the style of the master with confident free-flowing brushwork. Two paintings in the Asian Civilisations Museum collection, Landscape in the style of Huang Gongwang by Wang Yuanqi 王原祁 and Ink Plum Blossoms done in the style of Wang Mian by Qian Du 钱杜, are good examples of such imaginary copies. (Figs. 2 and 3)

The Problem of Copies
The general acceptance and proliferation of copies in Chinese art have made it conducive for unscrupulous dealers and artists to pass off copies as originals. Some Chinese connoisseurs consider it impolite or inelegant to expose the works of forgers; as a result, certain fraudulent works continue to be circulated in the market.7 For instance, artist and connoisseur Xiao Ping (b. 1942) was once asked by a friend to write a colophon on a painting of chrysanthemums by Fu Baoshi (1904-1965) which he felt was a fake. However, as the collector was a senior official whom he did not wish to offend, Xiao penned a colophon based on a poem of chrysanthemums by Fu, without mentioning the quality of the painting. He had hoped that whoever read his colophon in the future would be able to read between the lines and understand that he had declined to give an opinion on the authenticity of the painting.8
Therefore, given the presence of an active art market, the existence of forgeries in China, as in other countries, is unsurprising. However, the circulation of copies is not only a problem for unwary collectors. It also poses challenges for curators and art historians who have to ascertain the authenticity of works in order to construct an accurate history of an artist’s practice and in the process, establish a better understanding of Chinese art history.
General Principles Of Authentication
Generally, the task of authenticating involves close examination of two main aspects of a painting – dating and authorship. Firstly, one has to determine if the work comes from the period of its purported date. If undated, then the work should have been produced sometime during the artist’s lifetime. This involves technical analysis to assess the age of the materials used in the painting. Advances in scientific analysis have made the results of such tests generally objective and incontrovertible. However, for authenticating recent paintings, especially those by 19th and 20th century artists, such tests are less helpful as forgers usually have little difficulty in obtaining raw materials which are still relatively plentiful today. Moreover, in a heated art market where demand for paintings exceeds supply, it is not inconceivable for copies of a famous artist’s works to be produced and sold even during his lifetime, which makes it even more difficult to authenticate a work based on its age.
That said, the correct age does not necessarily mean that the painting is authentic. After the age of the materials has been verified, the next task is to determine if the artist is the author of the painting. An authenticator’s conclusions are drawn after looking closely at the painting and comparing it with authentic works. This requires the authenticator to have an intimate understanding of the artist’s practice, down to details like the artist's favoured type of paper to the places he travelled to and the people he met during his lifetime. It also requires a sufficiently large number of reliably authentic works for comparison. This can be a problem with very old works as few original works prior to the Song dynasty have survived. Sometimes, an artist may produce two genuine works with the same subject matter but of different quality. This poses difficulties later on as authenticators will have to decide which of the two genuine works to use for comparison purposes. Similarly, forgers may sometimes forge the works of artists whose paintings are long-lost, hoping that such works could never be verified against authentic extant ones.9
Ambiguous Cases
However, the question of what comes from the artist’s own hand is made murkier by paintings copied with the knowledge or authority of the artist. This has happened when the artist could not cope with high demand for his paintings and had to rely on students or relatives who could make relatively faithful copies to supply the needed works.10 The artist would complete the copy by writing the accompanying inscription and signature, with perhaps a few additional brushstrokes here and there to ‘improve’ the painting.11
Equally controversial is the practice of separating a painting into two. Chinese paintings are usually done on paper made from multiple layers of pulp. For a sufficiently thick painting, a skilful mounter can divide the work into two by carefully separating the paper layers to produce two thinner sheets. This results in two identical paintings. Both layers bear the same image since the ink would have penetrated both layers during the painting process. The only slight difference is that the image on the top layer tends to be sharper and have richer tones than the one on the bottom.12 However, it could be argued that both paintings remain authentic as they came from the artist’s hands and no third party was involved in the painting process.
To complicate matters further, there are recorded instances when a famous artist such as Dong Qichang 董其昌 (1555-1636), whose works were very much in demand, sometimes even permitted his friends to use his name on their own works.13 Another similar episode recounts how an impoverished senior artist, too embarrassed to ask Zhang Daqian for a painting, once invited Zhang to paint a joint work, which the latter agreed. Zhang first painted the figures and the senior artist later added the landscape elements. For such a collaborative work, both artists would usually sign the painting. However, in this case, the senior artist did not sign and instead asked Zhang to write the inscription. Sympathetic to the senior artist’s plight, Zhang complied with the request, even though he realised that the work could eventually be passed off as a painting done entirely by Zhang, and hence command a higher price as compared to a collaborative work.14
Specific Methods of Authentication
1. The Materials Of The Painting
As mentioned, the first task is to determine if a work comes from the period that it purports to date from. If undated, then the painting should have been produced sometime during the artist’s lifetime. A visual inspection is not sufficient as there are ways to create an aged or faded effect on new materials. For very old paintings, it is possible to send the paper or silk on which the painting is done, or the silk on which the painting is mounted, for scientific analysis. These tests usually provide a broad time period within which the paper or silk was made. Hence, they are more useful for authenticating older paintings rather than recent works. However, it should be noted that it is always possible for a resourceful forger to obtain old paper, silk and even ink sticks to make ink, and use them to create forgeries. This could extend to pulping blank pages from an old book to produce a piece of ‘old’ paper!15 Hence, even for genuinely old paintings, it is still necessary to determine if the painting was likely to have been painted by the artist.
For more recent works where the age of materials is not a useful guide of authenticity, an authenticator should be familiar with the types of paper, ink, seal paste and scroll mounting that the artist prefers or usually works with. Hence, a painting done on paper of a certain type would be suspect if the artist is not known to use that particular paper. However, such tests are never definitive. One can imagine a few possible scenarios where such anomalies may occur. For instance, the artist might have bought some new paper to try on but gave up after a few attempts. If those preliminary works survived, they would be hard to place within the artist’s overall output, especially if the artist did not mention these attempts to anyone.
2. Scrutinising The Subject Matter
Once it is ascertained that the materials used are of the type that the artist is likely to have used, the next step is to determine if the subject matter of the painting is typical of the artist for that particular period of his career. In this case, the subject matter refers to all the visual elements found on the painting surface: the images (be it a landscape, bird and flower or human figures), the calligraphic inscriptions and signatures, and the seals.
In terms of the imagery, the authenticator should ascertain whether the artist is known to have painted certain subjects during a particular period. For instance, an artist may be known for painting landscapes but not for human figures. Likewise, the authenticator should also examine the calligraphic inscriptions, signatures and seals to see if they are typical of the artist for the period in question. For instance, some artists may change their signature or the type of seals they use as they get older. Hence, a painting is likely to be a forgery if it bears a signature or seal that is chronologically inconsistent with the artist’s known practice. A careful reading of the inscriptions may also be helpful in authentication. For example, a careless forger may write an inscription purporting that the painting was a gift for a famous patron, but mistakenly include a date beyond the lifetime of the said patron.
3. Question Of Style
Even if the subject matter is typical, the authenticator then needs to determine if the manner or style of painting and writing is typical of the artist and corresponds to his known style for that particular period. This would involve comparing the work in question with known authentic paintings of the same period. In analysing painting and writing styles, emphasis is paid on the brushwork, use of ink and colour, and overall composition. Brushwork can be expressed in many ways – dry or wet, dense or sparse, thick or thin, light or heavy, broken or continuous, smooth or energetic, soft or angular – the permutations are endless. Likewise, the use of ink and colour can be similarly varied from light to dark, sparse to heavy. Composition may also be highly individualistic, balanced or asymmetrical, static or dynamic and so on. In terms of writing, it is important to compare the spacing between columns and characters to ascertain if there is a pleasing rhythm in the flow of characters and a balanced, harmonious composition. Such stylistic analysis is based on the assumption that most artists, though their styles may change with time, usually paint and write in a certain way for a particular period.
4. Determining Quality
Once it has been determined that the subject matter and style are consistent with the artist’s, the next aspect – quality – is the most difficult to ascertain. There is a common assumption that great artists always create good work, and a work of an ordinary or mediocre standard can never come from his hands. From a great artist, most would demand forceful brushwork, confident calligraphy, lively imagery, and a harmonious, if not striking composition. These are qualities that can reasonably be expected from works produced at the peak of his career. However, this necessarily also implies that works completed at an earlier age (when the artist’s skills were not yet fully honed or he was in transition between styles) or in his later years (when his physical faculties or energies were faltering) will understandably exhibit fewer of these desirable attributes. Forgers sometimes forge works from these periods precisely because authentic works created during those periods do not bear the artist’s mature style and will usually be accepted by collectors as being of secondary quality.16
In addition, a Chinese painting may be completed within a few hours, if not minutes. Hence, an artist could conceivably produce thousands of works in his lifetime. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect every single work to exhibit the same high standards. Inevitably, there will be works of a lower quality, perhaps produced when the artist was unwell, tired, uninspired or simply, socially obligated.
5. Tracking The Provenance
Lastly, after ascertaining that the age, subject, style and quality are consistent with the artist’s works of that period, the authenticator can further verify the work’s authenticity through its provenance, that is, the history of ownership of the work. This could be evident from the colophons – additional inscriptions – written by the painting’s various owners, either on the painting itself or its silk mounting borders. This is an accepted practice where owners either impress their seals or write a short piece of text to signal their ownership and appreciation of the work. This could then be verified against painting inventories maintained by the same collectors, where available. Emperors like Huizong from the Song dynasty and Qianlong (r. 1735-1796) from the Qing dynasty were famous for their inventories and these have proven invaluable in authenticating many paintings. However, listings in such inventories alone are not very useful as these inventories were seldom illustrated. Moreover, many artists tended to paint similar subjects or give their paintings similar titles such as ‘Fishing in the River’ or ‘Dwelling in the Mountains’, thereby making verification through such listings problematic. In recent times, it has become possible to obtain some form of verification from recollections of direct witnesses. These could be students, family members, collectors or close friends of the artist who were present when the painting was completed. These same individuals, if reliable, could also provide valuable information to prove that the painting was unlikely to have been produced by the artist. This is especially if they are privy to information that is not publicly known such as the artist’s likes or dislikes, or his habits when painting.
Difficulties of Authentication
It is important to always keep in mind that authentication remains a subjective test. Apart from an artist’s direct testimony, all other evidence will be circumstantial, and the conclusion can never be definitive. In some instances, it is even possible to question an artist’s testimony, especially if his memory is failing or there are special circumstances where he may want to hide the truth. For instance, a Singapore art collector recounted that when the famous painter Guan Shanyue 關山月 (1912-2000) visited Singapore in 1986, he was asked by many local collectors to authenticate works in their collections. When confronted with fakes, Guan would make light of the awkward situation by joking that “I have painted numerous paintings over the decades, but I don’t seem to remember having done this particular one. In any case, this artist can probably do a better job than I can!”17
After a thorough examination, the authenticator can, at most, opine that the painting is likely, very likely or unlikely to be the work of the artist. Even if the painting comes with a certificate of authenticity signed by the artist, there is no assurance that the work in question has not been replaced with a copy whilst in circulation. Generally, there are only a few instances when one can be reasonably certain that a work is genuine. They include works uncovered from archaeological sites, works obtained directly from the artist in his lifetime, and works donated by the artist to a public museum. In the latter case, it is then clear that the paintings did not have a chance to circulate in the open market where copies could be switched for originals.
Authentication requires very careful analysis and the application of any type of test will have to be done on a case-by-case basis. There are plenty of exceptions to the rule that have to be taken note of. For instance, when analysing a work based on an artist’s subject type, it is helpful to know that an artist’s subject preferences can change over time or he may favour several subjects concurrently. In addition, a landscape painter, pressured by a close friend or an important patron, may feel obliged to produce a portrait if faced with such a specific request. In such circumstances, it is understandable if the artist does not publicise the work’s existence. Hence, the fact that such works are unknown does not conclusively prove that they are not authentic.
Likewise, it is inaccurate to assume that an artist only has one style of painting at any given period. A skilled artist could conceivably be proficient in several styles at the same time. For one occasion, he could paint a landscape in a spare style, done in pure ink with quick brushwork. For another occasion (or perhaps for a different patron), he could choose to depict the same landscape in a more decorative and elaborate style, full of colour and intricate detail. Sometimes, even stylistic analyses may not be very helpful. For instance, experts see little use in analysing Ming artist Qiu Ying’s signature when authenticating his works as Qiu had felt that his calligraphy was inferior and often invited friends to sign his works for him.18
When analysing a painting’s quality, it is important to keep in mind the possibility of authentic works of low quality. Although many artists would be loathe to sell or give away inferior works, sometimes low-quality but authentic works may still leak into the open market without their knowledge. For instance, it is known that Xu Beihong had a habit of practising painting and calligraphy every morning, and often discarded unsatisfactory works by throwing them aside. Unknown to Xu, some admirers retrieved some of these unsigned works as keepsakes which later surfaced in the open market with spurious signatures or seals added on.19 Strictly speaking, these works cannot be considered fakes. Therefore, it is useful to keep in mind that a mediocre work does not necessarily mean that it is not authentic.
Lastly, just as the skills of authenticators increase over time, so have the abilities of resourceful forgers. For example, forgers are aware of the value placed on colophons for authentication. Hence, they are known to remove true colophons from original paintings and pair them with forged paintings in an attempt to give the fakes a veneer of pedigree. Similarly, a forger could also pair a fake colophon purportedly by a famous name with an authentic painting by a lesser name, in order to elevate the value of the painting.20 Art historian James Cahill has highlighted that Zhang Daqian sometimes asked other artists, collectors and connoisseurs to write laudatory colophons for his copies so that they could be passed off as originals.21
The Value of Copies
However, at the end of the day, it should be noted that authentication is not just merely a case of comparison, trying to match and identify elements in order to expose a fake. The ability to authenticate a specific painting by an artist and place it in connection with the rest of his works contributes immeasurably to our understanding of the development of his practice. This, in turn, provides a more stable foundation on which to build a better understanding of Chinese art history. Lastly, it is important to keep in mind the advice of art historian Wang Yao-t’ing, who once highlighted that when confronted with a Ming copy of a Song painting, one could adopt two possible perspectives: it is a fake from the Song perspective but nevertheless, a genuine work from the Ming period.22 Hence, once the painting is returned to its proper context, there is still value in the work and much to be learnt from it.

BeMuse Volume 5 Issue 1 - Jan to Mar 2012
For the better part of the past two millennia from the time of writing in 2012, India was a leading source of textiles for trade. Cotton cloth, along with a much smaller but highly valuable quantity of silk, was traded from production and distribution centres in Gujarat in northwest India and the Coromandel Coast in the southeast. Little known today, these textiles had a wide ranging and lasting impact on human civilisation in interesting and sometimes surprising ways. These textiles were the subject of the exhibition, Patterns of Trade: Indian Textiles for Export, 1400-1900, held at the Asian Civilisations Musuem until 3 June 2012.
Fragment: women battling a gajavyala (detail) Gujarat, 13th or 14th century, 104x154cm. Cotton; block printed, drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.
Evidence from excavations in the Indus Valley dating back to about 4,500 years ago shows that Indians had already developed the technology to weave cotton into cloth at that time. Two thousand years ago, Indian artisans and traders had built on their knowledge, along with a parallel expertise in painting and dyeing cloth, to become the world’s leader in textile production. They had held this position until the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century.
India’s advantage in textile production not only stemmed from its technological edge. The Indian subcontinent had a large population, which provided the workforce to perform the labour-intensive job of producing textiles. India also had ample land and a distinct dry season that made the region an ideal place to grow cotton. These advantages allowed Indian producers to manufacture a large surplus of cloth which it could trade to foreign markets.
Textile production and major trade centres in the Indian subcontinent, 1600-1900.
The bulk of India’s textiles were cotton of modest quality – plain colours or simple, repetitive patterns of checks, stripes or floral lattices. These textiles were sold in foreign marketplaces more cheaply than cloth could be produced locally. At the other end of the market, India’s weavers and dyers were capable of producing cotton and silk textiles of exquisite quality and beauty.
The Indian textile industry was both productive and efficient. First, weavers living in or near cotton growing areas would process and weave the cotton into cloth. Next, the cloth would be graded; following which middlemen would purchase the cloth and send it to workshops for dyeing, printing and painting. Dyers had to be located near adequate sources of clean water to ensure the quality of the bright and colourfast dyes which India was famous for. After dyeing, the agents would sell the cloth to merchants heading to foreign ports. India’s traders had developed a sophisticated understanding of the markets they served, providing feedback to producers on the types and qualities of cloth that were most in demand. These merchants, often settled and had families in their host markets, knew the tastes of their customers and were able to relay information to the agents about what colours, designs, formats and levels of quality were most desirable. At the height of the Indian textile trade, merchants even brought back local designs and motifs which the painters and dyers faithfully copied.
Hanging (kain leluhur): large flowers and cartouches Coromandel Coast, 18th century. 171 x 277cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.
The earliest evidence we have on foreign trade of Indian textiles is in the Roman account of the first century. The Romans called Indian cotton “woven air”, in praise of its lightness and quality. These accounts described Indian cloth as a luxury good; however, the quantities were sufficient for Pliny the Elder to complain in 77 CE (Common Era) that Roman coffers were being emptied into India. Historical records from about the same period also mention Indian cotton being sent as gifts to the Emperor of China. The oldest examples of Indian cloth are fragments found at archaeological sites in Egypt, along the coast of the Red Sea at Berenike (old Bernice), and date to the fifth century. More fragments, which date from the ninth century, were excavated at Quesir Al Qadim and Fustat (Old Cairo).
The fragments found in Egypt are proof that trade in Indian cloth continued to flow even after Rome’s gradual decline. The Islamic world also embraced Indian textiles after its rise in the seventh century, and the new religion spread to both South and Southeast Asia along the same routes on which Indian textiles were traded. By the end of the 15th century, this robust and complex network had spread throughout the Indian Ocean basin and from the western coast of Africa to China.
When the Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511, the Portuguese chronicler Tomé Pires estimated that the annual value of Malacca’s textile trade was worth 460,000 cruzados, the equivalent of almost 20 tonnes of silver. At that time, Malacca was one of the world’s richest cities, and Southeast Asia had grown to be a crucial market for Indian trade cloth. Island Southeast Asia was also the source of some of the world’s rarest and most desirable spices and aromatics, as well as other valuable commodities. Aside from the fragments found in Egypt, the earliest Indian trade textiles which survive today were found in the eastern half of the Indonesian Archipelago. These came from the remote islands of Maluku, as well as Timor and especially from the Toraja Highlands of Sulawesi. Some of these textiles have radiocarbon dates which range into the late 13th century.
Maluku, a tiny cluster of islands in the far Eastern Archipelago, was for much of history the world’s only source of nutmeg, mace and cloves. These so-called “fine spices” were used to preserve and flavour food as well as for their perceived medicinal powers. For centuries, these spices were literally worth their weight in gold in the West. Not surprisingly, traders flocked to the islands, bringing with them Indian cloth which were highly prized by the islanders.
While Maluku was more important economically during the time of the spice trade, it is Toraja which is the source of most of the earliest trade textiles that have been found. The Toraja called these textiles ma’a or mawa and believed that they served as a sacred bridge to the afterlife. Ma’a were used in funerals and other rituals and allowed the Toraja to interact and communicate with their ancestors. After the Dutch took control of the coastal ports of Sulawesi, the Toraja became isolated from the outside world and could no longer replace their Indian cloth. Instead they had to carefully preserve these textiles for generations, whereas in most other areas the cloths eventually disintegrated, were lost or replaced.
Early inscriptions found at archaeological sites clearly indicate that Indian cloth had been traded into Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Java in as early as the ninth century. The earliest and finest pieces discovered in this area, however, date from the 17th and 18th centuries. These were found in the remote interior areas of kampung and Jambi in southern Sumatra, and almost all originated from the Coromandel Coast.
Skirt cloth (kain leluhur): patchwork centerfield Coromandel Coast, 17th or 18th century, 223x422cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.
The reasons for this are complex. For one, the pepper boom of the 17th century had significantly increased the flow of cloth into the region during this period. More importantly, large amounts of top quality cloth were brought in by traders as gifts to local rulers. These found their way into the interior of Sumatra where they came to be valued as a form of currency which could be accumulated as wealth. These cloths eventually became heirlooms and were used in social rituals such as wedding exchanges. While the practice of storing these textiles as wealth was eventually abandoned by the more cosmopolitan trading centres of the coast, the people of Lampung carefully stored their early trade textiles until the 1970s and 1980s, when they began to re-emerge in the antiques market.
Large skirt cloth (kain dodot): floral lattice Coromandel Coast, late 18th century, 230x309cm, Cotton; drawn and painted, resist and mordant dyed.
In the 17th century, the European East India Companies began shipping Indian cloth home along with cargoes of spices and Chinese porcelain. The cloth quickly became a sensation. Compared to the drab woollens and linens the Europeans were used to, the Indian cloth’s beauty, quality and affordability made them hugely popular in Europe. European textile producers at first were unable to compete, which in turn threatened the livelihoods of tens of thousands of local textile workers. Even high taxes and import restrictions could not halt the flood of Indian cloth into Europe.
Beginning from the 18th century, innovators in Europe began to seek out the secrets of Indian textile production and started to develop ways to manufacture cloth more cheaply and efficiently. Mechanical innovations provided the key. Over the course of the century, new machines led to an explosion in productivity, which helped spark the Industrial Revolution.
By the mid-19th century, Europe was exporting more cloth to India than it imported. This cloth was cheaper and of better overall quality. European producers also captured much of India’s market share in other Asian and African markets. This had a disastrous impact on India’s textile industry, wiping out almost all of India’s indigenous textile production.
Indian trade textiles had a lasting influence on the development of textile designs. While the new machine-made cloths were less expensive and more consistent in quality, they continued to draw on the design legacy of their Indian predecessors. The bright floral prints and dense styles of the 19th and early-20th centuries were direct descendants of Indian chintzes traded to Europe hundreds of years before.
Nowhere else perhaps is the influence of Indian trade textiles more noticeable than in island Southeast Asia, where many of the indigenous textile traditions were profoundly shaped by their long and nearly continuous interaction with Indian cloth. Indigenous communities around the archipelago actively incorporated the designs and motifs of Indian cloths into their own textiles. As the 18th century progressed and Indian textiles became more expensive, textiles made in Indonesia began to replace Indian cloths. Inexpensive and high quality machine-made plain white cotton from the Netherlands provided the raw materials for a boom in batik production in Java, which the Dutch colonial government actively encouraged.
Even today’s fashion has continued to draw on the legacy of popular Indian designs. Once familiar with the designs, you will begin to spot them everywhere, such as in the repeating floral spray of a printed dress and in the scrolling border of a hemline. Indian trade textiles have left an indelible mark on the way we dress ourselves and decorate our homes. Perhaps even more profoundly, Indian trade textiles are a reminder that the globalised world we live in today has roots that go back thousands of years.

BeMuse Volume 4 Issue 3 - Jul to Sep 2011
With much of the island a sprawl of brick and steel, it can be easy to forget that Singapore is also home to many creatures that thrived long before man arrived and still survive in surprising numbers in the green lungs of the city. A mere remnant remains of the rainforests, mangroves and coral reefs that once enveloped the island and its coastal fringes with a landscape of trees, swamps and tidal flats. But what habitats exist today harbour a bewildering diversity of wildlife that make Singapore a hotspot for urban biodiversity and a treasure trove of discoveries for students of natural history.
The tiger and tapir are long gone from local jungles, but as of the time of writing in 2011, more than 50 species of mammals still share the island with man, having adapted to life in suburban niches or dwelling in the depths of the near-impenetrable forests. Some, like the Norway rat, are recent arrivals that colonised the island in the wake of vessels drawn to Raffles’ promising free port. Others, such as the plantain squirrel and long-tailed macaque, are commonly encountered residents of park edges that offer visitors an untamed counterpoint to manicured hedges.

Long-tailed macaque
But many four-legged Singaporeans only cross paths with cityfolk when weekend warriors make inroads into protected zones such as Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and the vast green heartlands that make up the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Boardwalks and broad trails provide safe access to many corners of these refuges. But even a short walk under the dense canopy of an exuberant secondary forest can render the bright lights of the city a distant memory and lure the senses into a world where chirps, whistles, growls and warbles accompany those who keep their mouths shut and eyes (and ears) wide open for a glimpse of the forest’s elusive inhabitants.
WHAT LIVES IN THE WOODS
The nature reserves serve as the final strongholds of two notable natives: the banded leaf monkey and the cream-coloured giant squirrel. The former, a robust primate that subsists almost entirely on fruit and young leaves, once ranged all over the island, but now maintains a tenuous existence in the woods around MacRitchie and Lower Peirce Reservoirs.
Recent surveys have found higher numbers than earlier thought, but the population in 2011 of 40 or so individuals is still threatened by high infant mortality, disease and genetic bottlenecks. Compared to the monkeys, the giant squirrel is in far dire straits, with no sightings since 1995. If not already locally extinct, this cat-sized arboreal rodent, which was discovered and scientifically described by Raffles in 1821, faces a bleak future and may well join the bear-like binturong and the red muntjac or barking deer as a permanent victim of overhunting and habitat loss.
One large mammal that has made a comeback after a century of persecution by hunters is the Eurasian wild pig. Also known as the wild boar, populations of this sizeable beast have returned to suitable habitats such as the thick forests around Lower Peirce Reservoir and the woods adjoining Nanyang Technological University in the west of the island. Herds also roam Pulau Ubin, where they frequent the coastal forest of Chek Jawa Wetlands and often surprise visitors with sudden dashes across the paths. Zoologists suspect the current populations originated from animals from Malaysia which swam across the Johor Straits in the past decade. Lacking natural predators such as big cats to control their numbers, the ecological impact of these wild pigs is still unclear. They pose little threat to humans, though, if left alone should one come across a family by the forest trails.
Wild boar at Chek Jawa
In recent decades, formal protection of Singapore’s remaining mangroves has led to the return of another mammal, the smooth otter. Reaching over a metre in length, this aquatic carnivore eats mainly fish and lives in the shelter of coastal mangroves and mudflats. Highly social and vocal creatures that communicate with sharp yelps, otters in pairs or small family groups have been seen in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Pasir Ris Park and Pulau Ubin. Although their habitats are largely protected, the species is still critically endangered in Singapore due to its small population. Abandoned nets left by illegal fishermen may also trap and drown the animals as they chase after prey in murky water. Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is probably the best place to catch sight of these endearing mammals as they nap by the riverbanks on warm afternoons.
Smooth otter
Residents of high-rise apartments close to the forests sometimes report seeing a strange creature clinging to trees or the wall of their facility. The culprit is likely to be a lost Sunda colugo, a shy mammal with broad skin membranes between its limbs that allow it to glide through the forest. Sometimes called the flying lemur, despite being unrelated to the Madagascan primates, the colugo occurs in healthy forests and is often spotted at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Bukit Batok Nature Park. Colugos feed on leaves at night and spend the day on large tree trunks, where their mottled colours and quiet disposition render them near-invisible to casual observers.

WINGED NATIVES AND WINTER MIGRANTS
Moving from fur to feathers, Singapore offers budding birdwatchers a wealth of colourful fowl if one is willing to look beyond the introduced mynahs, crows and sparrows that feed on urban refuse. But most of the 367 species on the national checklist will reward only twitchers (as keen spotters of rare birds are known) who leave their comfort zones and venture out to the forests, mangroves and coasts. One little red dot, however, can be easily seen at the heliconia groves of the Botanic Gardens. Voted Singapore’s national bird in a public poll by the Nature Society in 2002, the crimson sunbird is a hyperactive bundle of feathers that frequents the Gardens to feed on nectar. The male is resplendent in scarlet and electric blue, while the female is a duller blend of olive green and yellow. Sometimes mistaken for hummingbirds, which are found only in the Americas, sunbirds prefer to feed from a perch than hover.
Crimson sunbird
The otters’ avian counterparts are the kingfishers. Singapore is home to five resident species of kingfishers as well as three migrants that visit our shores during the winter months. With spear-like bills and the ability to dive into water to snare unsuspecting fish, these charismatic birds also feed on reptiles, insects and even other birds if the chance arises. A harsh, repeated cackle from the treetops is usually a sign that a collared kingfisher has just bagged a meal. The most abundant native kingfisher, this species is a smart white and blue and nests in tree holes. A much more colourful cousin is the blue and orange-brown stork-billed kingfisher, which can be seen at the Botanic Gardens, where individuals perch above the water to seek out aquatic prey.
Seagulls are scarce in Singapore waters, but their close relatives, the terns, are not uncommon along the island’s coastline. Clothed in white with webbed feet and slender beaks, these seabirds feed on small fish such as anchovies which they capture by diving from mid-air. One species, the black-naped tern, is probably familiar to Singaporeans who have used the Bird Series $1 currency notes issued between 1976 and 1984. Collected and described by Raffles, this graceful flier nests on isolated outcrops (Pedra Branca is one known nest site) but is threatened by predators such as herons and unscrupulous egg collectors.
WORLD BENEATH THE WAVES
The seas around Singapore, though appearing barren from afar, reveal their secrets when the tide is low enough to unveil an expanse of reefs and seagrass beds. This littoral wealth was noted by early travellers such as John Cameron, who wrote, as he sailed past Bukit Chermin at Telok Blangah, of “beautiful beds of coral, which in their variegated colours and fantastic shapes appear to vie with the scenery above.” Nearly 150 years after Cameron’s account, Singapore’s southern waters still host an incredible diversity of corals, with 255 reef-building species and many others in the shape of fans, whips, flowers and submarine trees. This amounts to nearly half as many coral species as Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in an area just less than 0.1% in size.
Seagrasses grow close to the reef flats and shelter fantastic creatures such as sea stars and seahorses. A family of marine plants that bear flowers and fruit, seagrasses are threatened by pollution and coastal development in many tropical regions. Singapore still harbours lush seagrass beds at areas such as Changi, Pulau Semakau, Cyrene Reef and Chek Jawa, a feature that offers possible lessons on how such habitats can thrive amid zones of high human impact. For seafood lovers, it is an issue that hits home, for these ecosystems provide valuable nurseries for prized creatures such as prawns, crabs, sea cucumbers and the young of many edible fish species.
Combining equine and piscine features with the breeding habits of a kangaroo, seahorses devour tiny crustaceans using a tube-shaped mouth and brood their young in a belly pouch, a task undertaken by the male. Though difficult to spot among the seagrass, these unique fishes are threatened by collection for use in traditional Chinese medicine. These slow-moving creatures share their home with sea stars, five-armed spiny animals that use rows of tube feet to move about and lack a head and eyes. One species, formerly common but now abundant only on offshore islands, burrows through loose sand and is often found in a pre-copulatory embrace, in which the male grips the female prior to reproduction. Another large local asteroid (the scientific term for sea stars) is known as the knobbly sea star. Reaching a foot in arm span, these armoured stars come in an array of colours from red to brown to blue to green. Found in seagrass beds and reef flats, knobbly sea stars are endangered by overharvesting for souvenirs or aquaria.
Knobbly sea stars at Cyrene Reef
In the reefs proper, there is a veritable menagerie that few are aware of. For instance, Pulau Hantu, a small island facing the oil refineries of Pulau Bukom, offers divers and waders a chance to see exotic wildlife without having to go to sites such as Tioman or Bali. Surrounded by shallow reefs, the island is home to sea slugs, butterflyfishes, feather stars, sea turtles and many other marine creatures that surprise visitors who explore its waters. Further south, the offshore landfill of Semakau combines a solid waste disposal facility with healthy ecosystems where turtles, sharks and even dolphins have been spotted.
Here, too, are found living homes within a larger home. Carpet-like sea anemones live attached to sand or rock on the reefy fringes of many southern islands. A barrage of sticky tentacles awaits blundering fish and crabs, but some ocean inhabitants have managed to avoid the stings by coating their bodies with a thin layer of slime. Thus protected, tiny shrimp and gaudy anemonefish feed and frolic in the safety of deadly arms. With luck and a little love from fellow Singaporeans who are learning to appreciate the value of their natural heritage, these unassuming creatures will hopefully survive to nurse new generations, find new hosts and enjoy the delight of all who cherish and call this island home.

THOSE THAT SLITHER AND SING
Though not everybody’s cup of tea, reptiles and amphibians abound in Singapore’s forests. Many are cryptic and camouflaged, and so escape the notice of most people. The green crested lizard can be found in parks such as the Botanic Gardens, where it hunts insects among shrubs and low trees. In turn, it serves as prey for the oriental whip snake, a pretty serpent that blends perfectly with foliage. Mildly venomous but harmless to humans, this snake is an adept climber and gives birth to live young, which are coloured brown.
Oriental whip snake
Reptiles enjoy basking in the sun, but frogs welcome wet days, when their mating calls resound from drains and other damp places. The banded bullfrog is a chubby insectivore with a croak that resembles the bellowing of cattle. Though common throughout the island, this pretty frog is believed to be an introduced species, though one that has not caused discernible harm to true natives. In contrast, the indigenous common greenback emits a bird-like warble and offers a soft chorus of echoes from ponds in city’s parks and rural marshes.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Darlene-Kasten-Heritage-Volunteers/story,"A volunteer guide with the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC), Darlene Kasten is meticulous, passionate, and endlessly knowledgeable. Aside from giving tours to the general public, she spends much of her time training new docents, being currently involved in the MHC training team as well as having previously co-led the training team at ACM.
A typical tour with Darlene
“We don’t think of it that way,” Darlene begins, “but Christianity is an Asian religion.” Jesus, after all, was born, lived, preached, and died on the Asian continent. Yet, the “Christianity in Asia” exhibition which Darlene led visitors through at ACM is the only gallery in the world wholly dedicated to sacred Christian art in Asia.
Darlene deftly navigated through the artifacts, reciting incredible details surrounding the art works — their form, their histories — which she knows like the back of her hand. Visitors are enriched by Darlene’s analysis of imagery and symbolism. They can see the Virgin Mary through the eyes of many Asian cultures: in Buddhist robes, donning royal Sri Lankan necklaces, standing upon crescent moons.
From ornate wardrobes and everyday tools to vastly different depictions of Christ across Asia, Darlene covers centuries. Reciting everything from memory, she enthusiastically tells rich and vivid stories that go beyond the museum labels.
While taking great care to point out minute intricacies, Darlene never loses sight of the bigger picture. She links each piece to the greater narrative arc about early Christianity in Asia, taking us through the religion’s fascinating journey and evolution through the continent.
Following her interests
Darlene’s particular passions often lead people to assume she studied anthropology, history or sociology. Imagine their surprise when Darlene reveals that she was a math and computer sciences major in college. Perhaps this explains her extremely systematic and meticulous approach to history.
Darlene has been doing volunteer work for 30 years. Her colourful experiences cover environmental organisations and conservation projects, from water issues in the US to animal conservation in South Africa.
Upon settling in Singapore in 2016, Darlene naturally gravitated towards similar volunteer projects. She worked with the Jane Goodall Institute and the People’s Movement to Stop Haze, before turning her attention to her other passion: societies and culture.
Her love of learning about different cultures led her to apply to be a volunteer at the Malay Heritage Centre (MHC), where she began training within a few weeks of landing in Singapore. Her stint at MHC eventually led her to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and, the rest was history.
Always well prepared
Darlene always checks on all the exhibits before her tours begin, with enough lead time to read up and prepare. The ACM, in particular, has been “a never-ending learning experience” for Darlene. As the museum constantly refreshes itself with new galleries and exhibitions, there is always new knowledge to be acquired.
“I am everybody’s nightmare, especially as a travel companion!” jokes Darlene, when responding to observations about the independent research she does. An avid traveler, Darlene playfully describes how she “torments” fellow travelers by constantly bombarding them with information. Of course, we can be sure that they are all the better for it.
Besides being a talkative travel mate, Darlene shares another endearing “job hazard” that comes with practising her tour at home. She describes her son’s first visit to MHC. She had arrived with him, excited to teach him all about Malay culture, only to find that he already had the information at his fingertips. “He gave me my own spiel!”, she laughed. “I had simply practised my lines so much to him.”
Offering fresh perspectives
As a non-Singaporean, Darlene is placed in a unique position to observe and scrutinise things that we Singaporeans take for granted. In her role at the Malay Heritage Museum, she offers fresh perspectives from beyond the racial dynamics locals have become familiar with. This frees her from any biases that we Singaporeans may have internalised over time, and allows museum visitors access to new and different ways of looking at our own country and history.
“It is very rewarding, especially when moving to a new country. Becoming a docent is a fast track to deeply understanding local culture,” says Darlene. Furthermore, being a docent gives her an opportunity to actively participate in the retelling and sharing of culture. Despite having already been to several archaeological digs in South America, Europe, and South Africa, Darlene reveals that her job as a museum docent excites her more.

Singapore’s thriving entrepôt and much talked about commercial vibrancy attracted poverty-stricken Chinese to the island in droves. In search of work and fortune, they took the plunge, boarding overcrowded junks for a perilous journey by sea.
The Chinese of early Singapore
The first bulk of arrivals in Singapore were mainly men who took on backbreaking work moving commodities and cargo from sea vessels to warehouses along the Singapore River.1 Known as coolies, these indentured labourers also worked in construction, agriculture, shipping, mining and rickshaw-pulling.2 As the port town of Singapore evolved, it received a regular influx of Chinese male immigrants. By and large, they came in three large waves between 1823 and 1927.

Unfortunately, life was far from rosy. On top of desperately low wages, and miserable living conditions, the majority of them owed money to middle-men from clan associations and secret societies for arranging passage and work in Singapore. Clan associations were far more understanding of their plight, granting them lodging and protection, as well as aid via mutual assistance schemes. However, immigrants who cut deals with secret societies had to pay membership fees to cover costs in the event they fell ill or died here. As a means of escape, many gambled or smoked opium.
Along the way, the authorities in Singapore curbed the number of male immigrants to the colony and relaxed its policies towards female emigration to even out the gender ratio. Between 1934 and 1938, 200,000 women, affected by economic challenges and a slew of natural calamities in China, came to Singapore.
Here, they found work in tin mines and rubber estates. Those who did general labour at construction sites around the island came to be known as samsui women. They primarily hailed from poor regions in China such as the Samsui district. Their work day usually started at 8am and they were largely tasked to dig soil. They carried earth, debris and building materials in buckets hung from shoulder poles. After work, they returned to tiny shared rooms in Chinatown.

Making a Mark
A number of sojourners to Singapore were so successful in their endeavours that their names have been immortalised around the island.
Take the case of Malacca-born vegetable seller turned tycoon, Tan Tock Seng. A hospital which he helped set up in the 1840s was named after him.5 It stands in Novena today.

Then there was ship chandler and one-time ice merchant Whampoa Hoo Ah Kay who was not only wealthy, but also an accomplished diplomat. A housing estate in a subzone of Balestier bears his name.6
Meanwhile, Hokkien merchant Chia Ann Siang, who traded in spices, coconut, tobacco, tin, tea and silk, has a hill in Chinatown named after him while Peranakan tycoon Tan Kim Seng who donated generously to water works, was honoured with a fountain at Esplanade Park.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/the-land-before-1819/the-land-before-1819,"At the tip of the Malayan Peninsula, close to the equator, there sits a landscape of generous greenery, hills and valleys between Malaysia and Indonesia. Trees provide shade, and tropical rainforest climate brings high humidity and abundant rain, without any distinct seasons.
This island has had many names over the years.
Why Temasek?
This panorama by well-known artist Percy Carpenter stretches from Pearl’s Hill on the left to Tanjong Rhu on the right. It is by far the most extensive view of Singapore from the mid-19th century, featuring the Singapore River settlement almost in its entirety. (c. 1856. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
No one can say for certain what the origins of the name are, despite its regular appearances in early Malay and Javanese texts. However, it has been conjectured that it comes from the Malay word tasik, meaning “lake” or “sea”, and in this case, probably “place surrounded by the sea” or “Sea Town”.
Even its spelling has taken on many forms; Tumasik in an old Javanese poem in 1365, Chiamassie in a version of Marco Polo’s travel account, and Danmaxi as it was referred as by Chinese trader Wang Dayuan.
During the 14th-century, Singapore was also known as Singapura in the Sejarah Melayu or Malay Annals - meaning “Lion City” in Sanskrit. Tan Sri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama) was the man who named the island city as such after a visit in 1299, during which he sighted a “lion”. However, the events are still a subject of debate today: was Sang Nila Utama a true Srivijayan prince from Palembang, as recorded in the Malay Annals, or was he a mere mythical figure?
Historical Artefacts
These are Javanese-style gold jewellery found at Bukit Larangan. These East Javanese style of these solid gold ornaments is a reminder that in the 14th century, the island of Singapore was under the political and cultural ambit of the East Java-based kingdom of Majapahit. (c. 14th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
A set of Javanese-style jewellery, believed to be from the era of the East Java-based kingdom of Majapahit, which encompassed much of Southeast Asia at its peak in the 14th century, was discovered by a group of Chinese workers at Fort Canning Hill in 1928. This discovery was described in the newspapers as one of British Malaya’s most interesting archeological finds. It serves as an indicator of the Majapahit’s existence and a reminder that in the 14th century, the island of Singapore was under the political and cultural ambit of the Majapahit Empire before the British arrived in 1819.
Other 14th century artefacts, such as shell remains, animal bones, Chinese coins and ceramics were found after an excavation at Empress Place in 1998 led by Professor John Miksic, providing further physical evidence of material culture from an earlier time. The major find from that excavation was a Javanese-style figurine of a rider on a horse. Made of lead, it is the only statue of its kind that has been discovered in Singapore. Unfortunately, the head of the rider was never found, which gave the statue its “Headless Horseman” name.
Artefacts include sherds of 14th century Chinese ceramics; Celadons from Longquan, white wares from Dehua; Blue and White from Jingdezhen and Shufu ware. Also discovered were Song Dynasty Chinese coins, bronze fishing hooks bones and earthenware (c. 14th-15th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
There were various shards of Chinese ceramics, including Longquan Celadons, and Song Dynasty Chinese coins. There was also a figurine of a rider on a horse that bears hallmarks of Javanese art from the 14th-century Majapahit Empire and offers evidence of strong trade and cultural links between Java and ancient Singapura.
The Singapore Stone
The area surrounding the river was framed with large rocks, with the Singapore Stone sitting at its mouth – the Rocky Point. It was said to have been hurled there by the legendary Badang, the strongest man in Temasek at that time. Believed to be the oldest record of writing found in Singapore, the stone has inscriptions in the Kawi script and some Sanskrit words, and has been dated to between the 10th and 14th centuries.
This is a fragment from an inscribed monolith known as the 'Singapore Stone'. It is the earliest writing found in Singapore, and was discovered at the mouth of Singapore River, near the present-day Fullerton Hotel. (c. 10th-14th century. Image from National Museum of Singapore)
All that is left of the stone now is a small fragment with ancient inscriptions that cannot be deciphered. The arrival of the British resulted in the loss of many traces of Ancient Singapura, and the Singapore Stone was eventually blown up in 1843 for the British fort and quarters.

The River of Time
Beyond myths and legends, the Singapore River holds clues and artefacts that can shed light on our rich history. These discoveries help to paint a more complete picture of Singapore’s distant past.
Being naturally sheltered by the Southern Islands, the mouth of the Singapore River was the old Port of Singapore. As Singapore lies at the confluence of seasonal winds and monsoons which ships relied on for travel, the river became the centre of trade and commerce.
The river was constantly bustling with activity. The Orang Laut, “sea people” in Malay, were the earliest known inhabitants around the river, living in sampans at its mouth, and in a village called Kampong Temenggong, located at the north bank of the river, along with other Malays.
With locations such as the Raffles Landing Site, a swimming spot for children at high tide, and where bridges provide connections between people and places then and now, the Singapore River is a symbol of the past and present coexisting side by side.

As they established a port in the southern part of mainland Singapore, it was only natural that they would need a communications centre to handle the administrative and operational matters relating to the port. The British eventually chose to set up a port communications centre on Fort Canning Hill as it was a strategic location which overlooked the Singapore Harbour.

Fort Canning Lighthouse
A flagstaff was built on the hill and it was used to transmit important details to the ships entering the Singapore harbour. By 1855, a simple lantern that doubled as a signal light was attached to the top of the flagstaff. The flagstaff light was replaced by the Fort Canning Lighthouse in 1902, which was constructed by Riley, Hargreaves and Company on the southern part of the hill.

The 24.3-metre high Fort Canning Lighthouse shone 20,000 candelas worth of light which was generated by a vaporised kerosene burner. The lighthouse’s beam occulted for three seconds every 17 seconds through the lowering of a metal cylinder around the burner.
Interestingly, when the old Supreme Court was being built on St Andrews Road from 1937 to 1939, the architects were instructed to ensure that the building did not obstruct the view of the Fort Canning Lighthouse. The lighthouse guided ships safely into the Singapore Harbour for 55 years until it was decommissioned on 12 December 1958, when tall buildings built along the Singapore Harbour had hampered its visibility from the sea.

Although the original Fort Canning Lighthouse survived the Second World War, the current one that you see standing in its original location is a fully-functional replica. In April 2014, the Fort Canning Lighthouse shone its light again after more than half a century as the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) launched Singapore’s first maritime trails. Since then, the replica remains lit at night.
Fullerton Lighthouse
After the Fort Canning Lighthouse was dismantled, a lighthouse was fitted on top of the Fullerton Building as a replacement. The Fullerton Building, situated at the mouth of the Singapore River, is a significant part of Singapore’s history having housed the General Post Office since its opening in 1928. The building survived the Second World War too and after the General Post Office moved out in 1996, this historical landmark was placed under conservation the following year. The building that stands at 1 Fullerton Square today underwent restoration works from 1998 to 2000 and was subsequently converted into the Fullerton Hotel which was officially opened in January, 2001 by the then Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Goh Chok Tong.
The Fullerton Lighthouse consisted of a round lantern with an aerobeacon in it. The revolving beacon stood about 48 metres above sea level shining 540,000 candelas worth of light which could be seen by ships up to 29 kilometres away.

The lighthouse was eventually decommissioned in 1978 as its function was limited by the growing Singapore skyline. In 1985, the lantern in the lighthouse was transferred to the Singapore Maritime Museum as a working exhibit. However, the artefact can now be found on display in an open site near Harbourfront Tower One after the museum closed in 2001. Today, the original site of the Fullerton Light on the 8th floor of the Fullerton Hotel has been transformed into a fine dining restaurant called The Lighthouse.

Bedok Lighthouse
The Fullerton Lighthouse was subsequently replaced by the Bedok Lighthouse. The Bedok Lighthouse is special in more ways than one. It was Singapore’s first fully automated and unmanned lighthouse, and was launched on Singapore’s National Day in 1978. In addition, it was the first lighthouse built atop a residential building on mainland Singapore. It is still functioning today on the roof of a 26-storey block in the Lagoon View condominium along Marine Parade Road.
The lighthouse flashes a beam of light 600,000 candela strong once every five seconds and has been reported to be visible up to 40 kilometres away at sea. The Bedok Lighthouse also helped pilots to navigate around Singapore’s airspace.

An additional lighthouse on mainland Singapore will be built to complement the Bedok Lighthouse.  It sits atop a nearby 25-storey Housing & Development Board (HDB) block along Marine Terrace. A closed-circuit television (CCTV) and electro-optic camera, as well as radio communications equipment will be installed at the new lighthouse to improve its functions and to boost its security.
This tale of the three lighthouses depicts the story of navigational infrastructure, such as lighthouses, evolving alongside the city state’s development. This highlights the need to always remain relevant amidst modernisation and advances in technology.

Philanthropic tycoon Tan Kah Kee (21 October 1874-12 August 1961) whom a MRT station is named after, was a larger-than-life kind of guy. When he died in Beijing, China, the Chinese government held a national funeral in honour of his contributions.1 What did he achieve in his lifetime exactly? His businesses created jobs for more than 30,000 people in Singapore and abroad. Tan, who married four times, lobbied against the war-bent Japanese, set up 100 educational institutions2, and also found the time to establish two newspapers.
Singapore’s Very Own Henry Ford
Tan Kah Kee left his home town in Fujian, China for Singapore at the age of 16, having received a Confucian-centric education.
At work, Tan was diligent, rising through the ranks of Chop Soon Ann, his father’s rice mill and sundries business in Singapore.3 By the 1900s, his father’s business ventures began to falter4 as a result of misappropriation and mismanagement. Tan worked to shut the companies down and was singularly focused on clearing their debts.
Tan later built his own empire. From a single pineapple canning factory, Tan soon had three such enterprises under his name.5 With these successes, he was able to buy back the original home of Chop Soon Ann in North Boat Quay.6 There, he established the Khiam Aik rice mill.7 When his businesses faced setbacks, he branched out into new markets and other sectors, staying nimble and conscious of global trends. At one point, his empire comprised pineapple and rubber plantations, rice mills and a biscuit factory. Tan also got involved in the shipping industry as well as the manufacture of tyres and shoes.8

At one point, his empire comprised pineapple and rubber plantations, rice mills and a biscuit factory. Tan also got involved in the shipping industry as well as the manufacture of tyres and shoes.8
In the mid-1920s, Tan’s empire created jobs for more than 30,000 people in Singapore and beyond. His success was attributed to his fastidious nature and involvement in all stages of the supply chain — much like Henry Ford, the great industrialist.9 Tan took several employees under his wing, his mentorship and tutelage leading to the rise of other movers and shakers such as Lee Kong Chian and Tan Lark Sye.10
Tan’s businesses wound up “naturally”, having been impacted by international financial cycles and catastrophes such as the Great Depression.11 Historian Wang Gungwu, who described Tan as “one of the earliest global Chinese entrepreneurs that the Nanyang produced”, said it was precisely because of the global reach of his businesses that Tan was subjected to such crashes.12
Instead of resting on his laurels, Tan reinvented himself to serve his communities in Singapore and China.

Confucian consciousness
A firm believer in education as a social leveller, and continually guided by Confucian values, Tan was involved in setting up more than 10 schools and institutes such as Tao Nan School, Ai Tong School, and The Chinese High School (now Haw Chong Institution after a merger with Hwa Chong Junior College)13 in Singapore. In China, he pushed for the establishment of Xiamen University.14

In 1923, Tan started Nanyang Siang Pau, a Chinese newspaper to encourage a reading culture and promote businesses. 15
In 1929, he was elected to serve as president of the Hokkien Huay Kuan.16 He used its platform to call for unity among Singapore’s varied Chinese dialect communities and to put an end to social ills such as opium addiction.
His mind was also on his home country. To this end, he set up a number of funds to provide relief for flooding victims, and to render aid following the outbreak of war between China and Japan in 1937. The following year, he served as head of the South-East Asia Federation of the China Relief Fund to further support the anti-war effort.
When the Japanese reached Singapore in 1942, Tan rallied members of the Chinese community to aid the British in repelling the invaders.17 For all his anti-war efforts, Tan was a prime target of the Japanese and thus had little choice but to leave Singapore. He ended up in Marang, Indonesia where he spent his time writing.18

After the war, Tan returned to Singapore and launched the Nan Chiao Jit Poh, a newspaper which took on an unfavourable tone towards the ruling Kuomintang in China. The British, fearing that the growing politicisation of Chinese in Malaya and Singapore, grew increasingly apprehensive about individuals such as Tan.19 At one point, they even considered cancelling his British citizenship.20 Tan left Singapore for China in 1950, and in 1957, renounced his British citizenship. In China, he dedicated his resources towards rebuilding and reconstruction efforts.
When he died in Beijing, China at 87, Tan was given a state funeral by the Chinese government to honour his contributions. His final resting place is in Ao Yuan, Jimei, China. In Singapore he’s remembered in various ways. For instance, a train station which opened in Bukit Timah in 2015 bears his name.

Notes"
https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-kelvin-ang/story,"Kelvin Ang loves old buildings. He has visited hundreds of Singaporean shophouses, bungalows, hotels, temples, churches, and mosques, and he is still fascinated by their beauty.
“On an old building, you can see the handiwork of many anonymous craftsmen from centuries ago,” he says. “All these things are made by hand: the columns, the plasterwork flowers, the carvings on windows, and the choice of coloured glass.”
He notes that Singapore is a truly unique city because it contains architecture from all over the world. On a single street, you can find buildings that reflect traditions from Europe, China, India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.
This is why he is trying to protect our built heritage. He works at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the government’s department for city planning, land use and conservation. His position is the Director of Conservation Management, which means that he is in charge of looking after our architecture for future generations.
Part of his job is making sure that heritage buildings are not damaged. Sometimes, when people install windows, signs or air conditioners in an old building, they change its overall design. He has to tell these people to have the building changed back.
Reaching out
Another more interesting part of his job is education and outreach. “How do you make 7,000 heritage buildings meaningful to the population?” he asks. “We have to carry out programmes so that people can appreciate and enjoy these buildings.”
One of these programmes involves students from the Tourism Club of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West. He has trained them to lead guided walks in Tiong Bahru, so that they can present the history of this neighbourhood to visitors.
Another programme involves young filmmakers from Nanyang Technological University. They create short documentaries about heritage buildings like the Hajjah Fatimah Mosque, and the Central Fire Station. You can watch these on URA’s YouTube channel.
Mr Ang believes that it is important for young people to have a connection to old buildings. But, this does not mean they must study facts about when these structures were built. It means they should spend time there, creating happy memories of their own.
He smiles whenever he sees folks taking graduation photos or selfies at old monuments. “They are making these places part of their personal life stories,” he says. “Without these stories, the buildings are just bricks and mortar.”
Vivid memories
Mr Ang was born in 1972. Like most Singaporeans, he grew up in an HDB estate. But, his mother often took him to Chinatown to visit friends and relatives. He was captivated by the sight of the crumbling old shophouses, and by the way people made use of the five-foot ways – the covered walkways between the buildings and the road.
“The five-foot ways of Chinatown were a kaleidoscope of possible adventures,” he says. “Everything was on display: there were people trading, doing homework, telling fortunes.” He also has a vivid memory of visiting a shophouse that had been turned into a Taoist temple. It contained a holy python kept in a red metal cage. He could see a big lump in the python’s belly because it had just been fed a whole chicken.
Looking back, he realises these childhood experiences gave him a special connection to Chinatown’s shophouses. “These buildings are important to me, not because of history books, but because they are part of my story as a citizen,” he says.
As a teenager, he discovered a book called Characters of Light: A Guide to the Buildings of Singapore by Marjorie Doggett. It was full of beautifully taken photographs of places like St Andrew’s Cathedral and Sri Mariamman Temple. Sharing it with his family members, he found that the photos made them talk about their own early memories. This was how he learned that art can play a part in preserving heritage.
Special features
But, it was only after he started working for URA that he truly began to appreciate our architecture. He learned that many old buildings were specially designed to keep a space cool without the use of electricity. For instance, traditional shophouse windows have shutters made of slanted pieces of wood. They allow air and light to enter a room, but they also block out the rain and most of the heat.
The five-foot way was also designed to protect people from the rain and the sun. However, it functions as a public space as well, where strangers can bump into one another and become friends. A couple of Mr Ang’s friends met each other in the five-foot way, and later even got married!
This is an example of how architecture can actually build communities. “In a city of millions, you do need small spaces where it is more intimate,” he says. He firmly believes that today’s architects have a lot to learn from builders of the past.
Of course, Singapore must change to keep up with the times. Sometimes, old buildings must be demolished so that new, modern buildings can take their place. Nevertheless, Mr Ang is working to ensure that some areas of the city remain the same, so that people can relive their memories whenever they pass them.
“I have friends who took their wedding pictures at Cavenagh Bridge, and now whenever they cross the bridge, they think, ‘How nice, this place hasn’t really changed’,” he says. “It’s all very romantic. And, good cities need a layer of romance.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-devagi-sanmugam/story,"Like many of us, Devagi Sanmugam (say “Day-vuh-gi sun-moo-gum”) enjoys looking at pictures of food on Instagram. However, she has noticed a disturbing pattern. Her friends mostly post images of western dishes, like Italian pasta and French almond cookies. It is much rarer for them to post images of local cuisine.
“People have gone berserk about food, but not food from their own backgrounds,” she says. As a cooking instructor, she has noticed the same thing among her students in Singapore. They long to work in famous Western restaurants. But, they do not know much about how to cook Asian food.
This is why she decided to publish her newest cookbook, I Am a Rice Cooker! It features information about forty different Asian cooking techniques, such as stir-frying, doubleboiling and dum cooking. It also lists one hundred recipes, representing the cuisines of ten Asian cultures. Last month, it won the third prize in the Global Finals of the Gourmand International Cookbook Awards, Cooking Schools Category.
According to Ms Devagi, Asian cuisine is more complex than western cuisine. For instance, while westerners recognise four basic tastes – sweet, salty, sour and bitter – the Japanese recognise a fifth taste: umami, or meatiness. Indians claim there are six tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, spicy and astringent (a taste that leaves a dry flavour in the mouth).
Furthermore, Asian foods often emphasise flavours that are overlooked in western cuisine. While western chefs avoid creating dishes that are sour or bitter, Asian chefs highlight these flavours with foods like assam fish and bittergourd.
Learning from mother
“As an Asian, it’s important to know your Asian cooking skills,” Ms Devagi says. “If you can master that, then you can master everything else very easily.” Surprisingly, she was never professionally trained as a cook. She learned her skills from her mother, her grandmother and her aunt, by helping them in the kitchen as a little girl.
She was born in 1956. Back then, everyone cooked food on a stove by burning gas, charcoal or wood. “I learned a lot about fire,” she says. “Fire is the most important thing for a chef. You have to learn how to control it. It brings out the best in food, and the smell of smoke makes such a difference.” She has very fond memories of her childhood meals. Her family was poor, but her mother cooked so well that they ate like kings.
She had six younger brothers and sisters, and her father could not afford school fees for everyone. So, after finishing Secondary Four, she started work. At her first job, she would sometimes surprise her colleagues by making cakes and kueh for them. They adored her cooking. This inspired her to become a cooking instructor.
With the support of her husband, she started Indian cooking classes in her flat. At first, she did not have many students. “I was only 28 years old, and everyone questioned me about my experience,” she says. Then, in 1983, an article in Her World magazine called her Singapore’s best Indian cooking instructor. The reporter loved the lively way she taught. “She said I was like a chili padi with a lot of punch!” she laughs. She began writing a cooking column for the magazine. In the 1990s, when Singaporeans were getting interested in wine appreciation classes, she started holding spice appreciation classes. This was how she got her nickname, “the Spice Queen of Singapore”.
The value of good cooking
Today, she still specialises in Indian food. But, she also has become an expert in the cuisines of many other Asian countries. She travels to cooking schools across world to do a one-week programme, called Tastes of Asia.
She worries that people here in Singapore are forgetting the value of good cooking and family recipes passed through generations as all of these form part of our intangible cultural heritage. She notes that her sisters say they have no time to cook lunch. They usually buy food from a stall – and then complain that it tastes awful. That is a miserable way to live, she feels. “If you are eating food and you feel it’s terrible, it’s not going to nourish you at all.”
Luckily, she knows that her recipes will be passed down for another generation. She has published 22 cookbooks so far, and has taught countless people her techniques. Although she has no children herself, she proudly tells me that all twenty of her nieces and nephews are good cooks. It is young people like them who will continue to keep the traditions of Asian cooking alive.

Be Muse Volume 5 Issue 2 - Apr to Jun 2012
Heritage is indeed alive and living amongst us, literally!
Not many people realise the magnificent Tembusu tree featured on Singapore’s five-dollar note is a Heritage Tree. Another well-known Heritage Tree is the towering Angsana tree along Upper Serangoon Road, near Woodleigh Park.
Angsana Tree at Upper Serangoon Road.
What are Heritage Trees? These are trees recognised and conserved under the Heritage Tree Scheme. The scheme was started in 2001 by the National Parks Board (NParks) to conserve magnificent mature trees in our landscape.
In the same year, the Heritage Road Scheme was also initiated. It seeks to conserve the unique tree-scapes along some roads in Singapore. Preservation of these Heritage Roads adds an element of permanence to the landscape, and contributes to Singapore’s sense of identity, history and continuity.
Introducing our Heritage Trees
The Heritage Tree Scheme was created to identify, recognise and preserve significant and valuable trees in the country’s landscape. As natural living landmarks of Singapore, our Heritage Trees hold important links to our past as we go forward into the future. The scheme also promotes the appreciation of these trees.
Heritage Trees are recognised for their girth (circumference of tree trunk measured one metre from the ground), size, aesthetic, rarity, as well as social, cultural and historical significance.
Out of the current 257 Heritage Trees as of 2018, 60 are located in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, including the Tembusu (Fragraea fragrans) featured on the back of Singapore’s five-dollar note.
Tembusu in the Botanic Gardens.
Reportedly more than 150 years old, this Tembusu tree has a girth spanning more than 7.8 metres in circumference and stands at a height of 30 metres. It is easily recognised by its signature lower branch.
>Isn't it wonderful to know that you carry an image of Singapore's Tembusu Heritage Tree with you all the time?
The Tembusu tree is an evergreen with deeply fissured tree bark. The wood is durable and hardy; in olden days, its trunk was used to make chopping boards. The Tembusu tree has a relatively regular flowering pattern, which occurs twice a year – usually in May or early June and October or November. During flowering seasons, its creamy-white blooms emit an enticing fragrance. You will not miss their perfume, especially in the late evening when the fragrance is stronger.
Another majestic Heritage Tree in the Singapore Botanic Gardens is the Penaga Laut (Calophyllum inophyllum), located next to the Botany Centre. This slow-growing evergreen Penaga Laut Tree is more than 100 years old. It plays host to several other life forms such as ferns, climbers and small animals. You may chance upon a squirrel scuttling among its branches as you admire the tree.
“Calophyllum” means “beautiful leaf” in Greek, and that aptly describes the tree’s beautiful leathery leaves, with their numerous slender veins.
The Penaga Laut is exceptional as all parts of the tree – namely the leaves, bark, flowers, fruits, seeds and roots – can be used for medicinal purposes to treat various ailments such as skin disease, piles and chickenpox. The seeds produce fragrant oil that is valued by some as a natural moisturiser. This oil is also largely used in cosmetics and soap-making, or even as burning fuel. The wood of this tree can be used for heavy construction, such as furniture and shipbuilding.
The Tembusu Heritage Tree and the Penaga Laut Heritage Tree in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, as well as the other 257 Heritage Trees located all over Singapore as of 2018, can be easily located as all of them are listed in the Heritage Tree Registrar on the NParks website.
Nominate A Tree!
Anyone can nominate a tree for heritage status, and help contribute to Singapore's sense of identity, history and continuity.
If you come across any tree which has the potential to be a Heritage Tree, you can nominate it by simply filling up a form at the NParks’ website. Nominated trees will be inspected by NParks’ arborists (“tree doctors”) and assessed by the Heritage Tree Panel to determine their suitability as Heritage Trees.
Our Heritage Roads
Another interesting segment of Singapore’s living heritage is the Heritage Roads. Currently, we have gazetted five Heritage Roads to promote the conservation of these scenic and significant tree-lined roads in Singapore. They are Arcadia Road, Lim Chu Kang Road, Mandai Road, Mount Pleasant Road and South Buona Vista Road.
Heritage Roads include South Bouna Vista Road (above) and Arcadia Road..
Heritage Roads are easily recognised by the wide canopies extending from the big trees overhanging these roads, forming a green tunnel and providing much needed shade from our scorching sun.
Travelling along Mandai Road is a pleasant and tranquil experience, as adjoining the road is the scenic Upper Seletar Reservoir Park. The starting point of this Heritage Road is opposite Upper Seletar Reservoir Car Park, and it ends at the junction with Mandai Avenue.

Constructed in 1855, this road used to be an old carriageway that served as one of the main links between Woodlands and Upper Thomson, connecting the agriculture and poultry farming villages in the area.
Another Heritage Road is South Buona Vista Road, which begins before the junction with Storkport Road and ends at the junction with Vigilante Drive. Constructed before World War Two, South Buona Vista Road (means “a good view” in Italian) used to offer elevated views of the sea. It was on this part of the ridge that the famous battle of Pasir Panjang was fought in February 1942. South Buona Vista Road is also distinctive for its many curves. Lining the sides of the road are mainly Tembusu and Yellow Flame trees, as well as other mature trees.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/hazel-locke-memories-of-world-war-ii/story,"Hazel Locke recalls vivid scenes of the war reaching Singapore decades ago when she was a young woman.
Hazel as a sergeant with the Women’s Auxiliary Corps, India who helped with military communications in code work.
When World War II began, on 8 December 1941, I was at a cinema called the Alhambra opposite Raffles Hotel. Suddenly, on the screen there was a news flash. Japan had declared war.
Singapore was not affected at the beginning. People went about their business as I did, going to work at Cold Storage till the time came when bombs were falling in parts of Singapore. Orchard Road was probably the first area to be hit.
The “10-cent shops” — where everything cost 10 cents — were very popular with the people. The shops were operated by the Japanese. Before the war, all the shops “disappeared” (closed down), which led to word getting around that the shop keepers were spies.
At my workplace 
I was at work manning the switch board, when two bombs hit the Cold Storage building. One fell on a corner of the supermarket. The other hit the sausage and kitchen department, which was separated from the supermarket by a garage that housed the delivery vans. One of the two bombs hit a pipe releasing ammonia that was so thick on the ground, that we all scrambled up a spiral staircase to get to the top of the building to fresh air. 
At the time, I was in the midst of all the scrambling. I remember going up the spiral staircase with the rest of the people. I heard someone tell us to try and find a hanky or any other cloth, to wet it and cover our noses and mouths with it. It was better when we reached the top. I am glad to say no one was injured.
Going back a bit, before bombs fell, we (the girls in the order department) had been told to stay at our positions by the manager, Mr Fincher, till he gave the go ahead to take cover. When he told us to go for cover, I was at the switch board and was told to ring the sausage and kitchen department where there were three workers who had also been told to stay in their positions till they got the order to take cover.
I remember ringing non-stop, but no one picked up the phone. Mr Fincher was getting very anxious and came back again and again, but saw that I was still trying to get someone to answer. He then told me to go for cover. But, after trying for so long, I was not prepared to give up. I gave one last ring, and this time someone picked up the phone, and I shouted at him to take cover, just in time before a bomb hit the building.
Luckily, in that raid no one was hurt.
Last-minute decision
Another important story was how lucky my mother, sister, youngest brother, and I were to escape the Japanese occupation of Singapore. At first, my family had no plans to leave Singapore, but my late Uncle Basil Johannes came to our house on the 6th of February, in the late evening at about 6 o’clock, and told my father off about not doing anything to get us away. It was a last-minute decision, so much so that all my mother could do was to gather some clothes and put them in a sheet to carry on board.
Thinking back, I never questioned how my father and brothers, Osbert and Balfour, managed to get us to the wharf. We were living in a shop house at Serangoon Road, and there must have been a problem getting a taxi that was operating during the curfew because it was hours before we arrived at the wharf.
All I knew was that my brother Balfour, with a torch in hand shining on the road so that the taxi driver could see, was running alongside the taxi. It was pitch dark because of the curfew. It was quite a miracle that a taxi driver was willing to take us to the wharf during the curfew. My father had made all the arrangements as he and my elder brother were immigration officers and were waiting for us at the port gates.
I never found out how my father and brothers returned home.
The British government had sent ships to evacuate women and children who wished to leave Singapore. My mother, carrying clothes bundled in a white sheet, and the three children were among the last fleeing passengers to board the Felix Roussel, one of the last three big ships at the wharf waiting to carry evacuees to safety in India. We wanted to go on the Devonshire because my late uncle was on it, but it was full.
On the ship
I remember that no sooner were we on the gangway than the sirens sounded. Troops were dismounting from another gangway at the other end of the ship. Those who fled Singapore were mainly women and children.
I can remember being in one of the cabins downstairs. I looked through the porthole and saw Japanese planes looking like toy planes in the sky, and a bomb falling and just missing the ship. I’ll never forget that. The captains of all three ships instantly gave orders to pull up the gangways and took off.
Life on the ship was hard. There was only preserved food that was already nine months old as the ship had no time to take on board fresh food. Japanese planes had been spotted headed to the port. Once, I had to eat a piece of cheese that was so hard it cut my lips. When I arrived in India, I was overjoyed when, at my first meal, I was given what I thought was a jug of orange juice. I took a sip, and realised it was actually orange muddy water.
Luckily, all three ships managed to get away and brought those on board to safety in India, where we were given refuge throughout the war.
Not all survived
Sadly, I heard all other ships, smaller ones that carried evacuees, were not so lucky, particularly one that left on the 13th of February. If I remember correctly, it was a Friday. I remember a Greek woman with her identical twin were on one of the ships that was bombed. With the rest who were on board, they found themselves in the water fighting for their lives.
According to the woman, she got parted from her twin. She was one of those who were picked up and arrived safely in India, eventually. She mentioned that some people managed to get to the islands around Singapore.
She was so upset and never stopped pining for her twin.  I do not know whether she was ever reunited with her twin because we were put in groups and sent to Coimbatore, but she was not in our group.
Refuge in India
When we arrived in India, it was at Bombay (Mumbai today). We were housed in the rajah’s domains. The one we were in, I believe was haunted. I woke up one night because I heard a heavy flow of water running from the tap in the bathroom — so I got up and went to shut it off. But, when I got to the bathroom it was perfectly dry! It was an eerie moment for me!!
Surprisingly, I had rather a good time as a refugee. My family stayed in Coimbatore, which was then just a quiet town. As there were no cars, I often had to travel in a jutkah, which was a man-driven atap-covered wagon drawn by bullocks. I used to jump in the back and sit with my legs dangling. 
There was a huge dance hall where the British Fleet Air-Arm held dance parties with women from the town and the women refugees every few weeks, dancing the night away.
I even ended up joining the army myself. I was a sergeant with the Women’s Auxiliary Corps, India, and helped with military communications in code work. I was posted all over India and received three award ribbons for my services.
At the end of the war, we were returned to our respective countries. I was reunited with my father, sister and brothers. They never described their war experiences, but I knew they had experienced terrible starvation and torture.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-lai-ah-eng/story,"When Dr Lai Ah Eng was a little girl, one of her teachers insulted her and her friends for being poor. “You girls will never eat cream,” the teacher said. “You will only eat cow dung.”
Her father had migrated to Malaysia from Hainan Island in China around the year 1930. He was so poor and uneducated, he did not even know how to read or write. Luckily, he was able to make a living by running a kopitiam, or coffee shop, in the city of Kuala Lumpur.
Every morning, he would wake up at five o’clock to light a fire in the oven, slice the bread, and prepare coffee for his customers. People would begin arriving just before six to hear the first broadcasts on the Rediffusion radio station.
Growing up
Growing up in the sixties, Dr Lai was able to study at the free school nearby. But, after classes, she had to help out with the business, together with her mother and four sisters. She would try to do her homework at the counter, when she did not have to wash the cups and spoons, sell cigarettes, and sweep the floor before closing. Usually, they would not finish work until ten or eleven at night.
At first, she hated the work. She secretly made a promise to herself: “I’ll never marry someone who runs a coffeeshop!” But, after some time, she began to appreciate how important the place was. It was a place for the community to gather and enjoy cheap, good food while listening to the news on the radio.
It was also a very multicultural place. Besides their own bread and coffee, they sold nasi lemak and pisang goreng, made by a Malay neighbour. Sometimes, people set up their own food stalls beside the shop, including an Indian woman who sold appam and a Hakka woman who sold laksa.
At one point, developers bought the land and announced that they would demolish the shophouse. “My father was so depressed, his hair suddenly turned white in one month,” Dr Lai remembers. Thankfully, an Indian man across the street offered to let the family take over his shop, free of charge, because he was returning to India.
A training ground
Today, Dr Lai is a professor at the National University of Singapore. She is an anthropologist: a person who studies human societies and cultures. She suspects that working at her father’s kopitiam was good training for the job. It was a centre of activity and a window to the world.
Five years ago, she was part of a team of researchers studying migration. Most of her colleagues were focusing on new immigrants to Singapore. She, on the other hand, decided to look at how older immigrants had become part of our community. She did this by studying the history of kopitiams.
She learned that many early kopitiam owners were Hainanese, just like her father. For instance, the famous Ya Kun Kaya Toast business was originally a food stall set up by Loh Ah Koon, a Hainanese immigrant who came to Singapore in 1926 when he was just 15 years old. Jack’s Place, Han’s and Killiney Kopitiam were all also founded by Hainanese people. The cooks served Asian versions of western foods, such as toasted bread and pork chops, because many of them had worked as servants in British homes.
But, it was not only the Hainanese who ran food stalls. Immigrants from other parts of Asia did the same thing. In 1924, a man named Bhavan from India set up Ananda Bhavan, which is now a vegetarian restaurant chain. In 1958, a Sumatran immigrant set up Sabar Menanti, which still sells nasi padang in Kampong Glam.
Our kopitiam heritage
From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Housing Development Board (HDB) began to move people from kampungs into public housing estates. They also opened new kopitiams in these areas, bringing together stallholders and customers of different races. “The kopitiam naturally became one of the first public gathering sites for those disoriented by resettlement,” Dr Lai says. Old friends could meet there and also make friends with their new neighbours. They also began to enjoy each other’s foods, giving birth to the multicultural Singaporean cuisine that we know today.
However, these kopitiams are now under threat. Previously, neighbourhood kopitiams were mostly owned by stallholders. But, since 2001, many kopitiams have been taken over by chain operators such as Koufu, S11, Food Republic and Kopitiam.
These businesses often renovate the spaces, charge higher rents, and then sell them again to make a profit – sometimes just after a few years, or even months! As a result, the rents for stallholders keep going up. Because of the expense, many stalls are closing.
We, Singaporeans, are proud of our kopitiam heritage. This is why Ya Kun and Killiney use nostalgic items like wooden stools in their shops, to bring back memories of the “good old days”. But, big businesses are making it almost impossible to succeed as a stallholder now. Dr Lai notes that if her father had migrated in modern times, his business would never have been able to survive.
The Government is working to address the current situation. They have stopped allowing sales of their newly built kopitiams, and only rent out them to operators to help keep costs reasonable. But, we should do more so that our beloved kopitiams may be enjoyed by future generations of Singaporeans.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-kennie-ting/story,"When he was a young man, Kennie Ting was bothered by a peculiar question: “Why am I who I am?”
He felt that his culture was quite weird. He was Chinese, but his first language was English. He also loved lots of different foods, like Hainanese chicken rice, Malay sambal and Indian fish-head curry.
After doing some research, he realised he had become this way because of Singaporean history. Our island has always been a trading port where people of different cultures have come together, exchanging goods and ideas. As a result, everyone here has an identity that is a bit mixed up.
You might think this is a bad thing. After all, it can be confusing not to know exactly who you are. But, it also means that we have a fantastically rich heritage. We can look at the cultures of many different lands, and see how they have influenced our own lives.
Heritage may be ancient
Mr Ting now has the chance to help more people learn about our heritage. In September 2016, he became the Director of the Asian Civilisations Museum. This means he is in charge of displaying some truly marvellous objects from all over Asia, such as paintings, jewellery, costumes and statues of gods. Some of these items are thousands of years old.
His job is exhausting. He has to spend all day meeting different people, explaining his ideas about the museum’s programmes. He speaks to politicians, religious groups, tour guides, tourists, business leaders, art collectors and schoolchildren. He also has to wear a formal suit when he addresses them, when he would really prefer to be hanging out in a T-shirt and slippers.
Fortunately, he is still enthusiastic about his work. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to shape the museum in the way I want to,” he says. “Working with this beautiful collection is quite exciting.”
In November 2016, he opened an exhibition called “Port Cities”. It featured historical objects from many Asian cities, including Singapore, Manila, Guangzhou (which was once called Canton) and Kolkata (which was once called Calcutta). These places were connected by shipping routes, so they became very multicultural.
If you had visited the show, you would have seen a portrait of Cornelia van Nijenroode, a wealthy half-Dutch, half-Japanese woman who lived in Indonesia in the 1600s. Also featured in the show was a necklace made of French gold coins, owned by the Tamil moneylenders of Vietnam in the 1800s. These objects show that many people in the past had mixed-up identities, just like us.
The exhibition meant a lot to Mr Ting. He has explored many Asian cities, learning how their cultures are linked. He has even written a book about this topic, The Romance of the Grand Tour: 100 Years of Travel in Southeast Asia.
Sadly, he feels that these cities became less multicultural in the 20th century. Often, this is because their governments emphasised one culture over all the others. As a result, Guangzhou became more Chinese and Kolkata became more Indian.
But, in Singapore, something different happened. Because we were both a city and a country, we made multiculturalism part of our national identity. “We are in a unique position,” Mr Ting says. “We have a perspective that no-one else has.”
Heritage is all around
Lately, Mr Ting has been thinking a lot about “intangible heritage”. This is heritage that is not made up of objects in galleries, but activities and knowledge.
He is trying to spread awareness about this through a programme called the Asian Culture and Music Series. Visitors will be able to watch events such as Burmese puppetry shows and Indonesian gamelan concerts for free.
However, the term “intangible heritage” covers much more than just the performing arts. It also includes the languages we speak, the games we play, the meals we eat, our religious ceremonies and our holiday celebrations.
For this reason, Mr Ting says, “To say you have no heritage is nonsense. All Singaporeans are experts in Singapore heritage.” You may be a kid, but you already know a lot about the customs and beliefs of your family. You also know many interesting things about being a kid in the early 21st century. These things may seem ordinary now, but they are part of your identity, and they are important.
The truth is, heritage is everywhere, not just in museums. “There are interesting and amazing things all around us,” says Mr Ting. “Just open your eyes. The things that you take for granted may be absolutely wonderful if you just dig into where they came from.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-som-said/story,"Som Said is Singapore’s most famous Malay dance choreographer, and she cares deeply about heritage. In fact, she has spent over fifty years performing and teaching traditional Malay dance.
However, her love for the past has never stopped her from trying new things. Over the years, she has created many innovative performances, sometimes by borrowing dance techniques from other cultures or by using modern technology.
For example, last year, her company staged an event at the Malay Heritage Centre called “Inspirasi 9”. It took place over two nights. On 11 November, dancers mostly performed folk dances, such as masri, joget and zapin. But, on 12 November, they put up contemporary works, interacting with video and live computer animations.
“Tradition is not static,” she explains. “When heritage is passed down from generation to generation, it has to keep moving to stay relevant.”
Growing up with dance
When Madam Som was a little girl in the 1950s, she did not have a dance teacher. Instead, she learned dance by watching movies. She would go to the cinema with her sisters to watch Malay films, then spend hours at home in front of her mirror, trying to imitate them. (She says it was quite similar to how kids today learn dance from YouTube!)
She began teaching her schoolmates the dance routines. By Primary Two, she was already creating dance performances for her school’s Sports Day. Then, while she was in Anderson Secondary School, her friend invited her to join her father’s dance troupe, Sriwana. She began taking part in public performances at the age of 14, in the year 1965.
“Sriwana did folk dance, but we did not emphasise tradition,” Madam Som remembers. “We also did modern dance to pop songs. During that time, people didn’t care about what was traditional and what was modern.”
She was, therefore, able to make some interesting changes to traditional Malay choreography. Some dances had always used items like fans and umbrellas, but she began to feature more unusual props like trays, drums and betel boxes. She also used the dances to tell old Malay legends, such as the tale of how ancient Singapore was attacked by swordfish.
While she still loved the old Malay folk dances, she knew they had originated in Malaysia or Indonesia. She wanted to create new works that reflected her Singaporean surroundings. She found plenty of ideas simply by attending weddings. Each weekend, she carefully observed the movements in the ceremonies and people’s interactions, and incorporated all that into her dances.
Dancing for Singapore
From 1970 onwards, she was also a dancer in the National Dance Company, a new troupe set up by the government that included people trained in Chinese, Malay and Indian dance. The company was trying to create a new dance tradition that would reflect the cultures of all three major races in Singapore.
Madam Som was doubtful about the project. “I wondered, why are we rehearsing so hard? Why do I have to learn Indian dance and Chinese dance? What are we going to present?”
Then, in 1972, the company performed at the Adelaide Festival in Australia. To her surprise, audiences loved the show. This proved that a young, multiracial nation like Singapore could develop a culture of its own. Madam Som was so moved that she later named her son “Adel”, after the festival.
Sadly, the National Dance Company closed down in 1985 due to lack of funds. But, its spirit still lives on in the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Dance Ensemble. This is a multicultural dance troupe for kids, run by Madam Som and her fellow dancers Yan Choong Lian and Neila Sathyalingam.
She trains students in Malay dance, while Madam Yan and Madam Neila train them in Chinese and Indian dance. “Instead of just Malay heritage, this is Singaporean heritage,” she says.
Traditions add to identity
Since 1997, Madam Som has been the Artistic Director of her own company, Sri Warisan. It has been called Singapore’s first professional Malay dance company because it pays its performers a proper salary. (Madam Som had previously earned money by running a bridal boutique, while rehearsing her dances at night.)
The truth is, Sri Warisan focuses on more than just dance. It promotes all kinds of traditional Malay performing arts, including angklung music, bangsawan opera and wayang kulit puppetry. Last year, its dancers participated in festivals in Qatar, Poland and Guam, while its puppeteers travelled to Spain, Russia, Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar and Vietnam. They also ran arts education programmes in 122 different Singapore schools!
However, now that she is 66 years old, Madam Som rarely dances. She still teaches classes, and serves as a judge for the Singapore Youth Festival. But, she spends most of her time researching the history of Malay dance in Singapore, so that she can write a book about the subject. “It’s a new step for me, to share, to write about why we dance,” she says.
She feels optimistic about the future of Malay dance. Although it has changed in many ways, its foundations are strong, and it remains closely connected to the folk dances she learned as a girl.
In the same way, she believes Singaporeans can move forward while holding on to their “jati diri”, or identity. To her, tradition is not a burden. It is an inspiration.

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/heritage-heroes-john-miksic/story,"In the early 1980s, the Singapore government was making plans to develop Fort Canning Hill. They wanted to turn it into a centre for entertainment and culture, with an underground car park for 300 vehicles.
But, some employees of the National Museum (present-day National Museum of Singapore) were unsure about this. They knew that there were legends that a palace had stood on the hill in the 14th century. In January 1984, they invited an archaeologist to investigate the site for any traces of Singapore’s ancient past.
The archaeologist’s name was Dr John Miksic. He still remembers the trip vividly. “We had ten days,” he says. “I had three groups of workers: museum staff, hired Indian labourers, and some national servicemen who were being punished. I was not sure what kind of cooperation I was going to get from them, but once I explained what we were doing, they got very interested.”
At first, his team found only the skeleton of a goat, an old British army helmet, and a few bricks from the 19th or 20th century. To make matters worse, it rained heavily. Every day, he would go back to his hotel with his shoes covered in mud.
The team started digging near the Keramat Iskandar Shah, a shrine which is said to mark the tomb of the last king of Singapore. “Suddenly we saw the soil colour change and we started finding different kinds of artefacts,” Dr Miksic says. Among these items were pieces of blue and white Chinese porcelain, made during the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368). This meant that the site dated back to at least the 1300s.
It was a landmark moment. The team had found evidence that a 14th century settlement really had existed on Fort Canning Hill. In response, the government agreed to change its development plans. They knew that the remains of ancient Singapore were far too precious to be disturbed.
Fascination with history
Dr Miksic was born in the USA in 1946. He grew up on a farm in western New York. Sometimes, he would find old Native American stone arrowheads on the ground, which made him wonder about life in the past. This fascination with history led him to become an archaeologist.
Since then, he has carried out digs in many different countries, including Canada, Honduras, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia. However, most of his work has taken place in Singapore, where he still lives today.
Over the years, he has found some remarkable treasures in our soil. For instance, he uncovered pieces of a Chinese porcelain bowl, which was once used as a compass. Sailors would have filled the bowl with water, and then floated a magnet on the water’s surface. The free-floating magnet would naturally point north. This is the world’s only surviving example of a compass like this.
Another strange artefact is a tiny statue of a headless man on a winged horse. It is made of lead. As far as we know, the metal lead was not used in statues in ancient Southeast Asia. He is still deeply puzzled about how it came to be in Singapore. He thinks it may represent Raja Chulan, an Indian king who was said to be the father of Sang Nila Utama.
As an archaeologist, he does not rely solely on buried objects to get information about the past. He searches for historical documents from all over the world – such as writings by European traders, Chinese explorers and Javanese historians – to build up a picture of what ancient Singapore was like.
Great contributions
“Life in 14th century Singapore was a lot like modern life,” he explains. The population was multiracial, including Malays, Chinese, Indians and Orang Laut. They worked a variety of jobs, such as fishing, winemaking, saltmaking and working with metal. They mostly seem to have lived in a small area, inside a walled city. There would probably have been trees within these walls, meaning that we were already a garden city in ancient times!
The rulers of Singapore had to worry about keeping peace with larger neighbouring kingdoms in Java and Siam, which attacked Singapore on different occasions. The rulers also reached out to China; there are records that they gave gifts of tribute to the Chinese Emperor and commanded their subjects not to attack Chinese traders. However, we mostly enjoyed good trading relations. This may explain why the remains of trade goods from all over Asia have been discovered in our soil.
Clearly, Dr Miksic has made huge contributions to our knowledge of Singapore’s ancient past. Yet, if you ask him what his greatest accomplishment is, he will not talk about his discoveries. Instead, he will describe his work as a teacher. He has trained young Southeast Asians in archaeology so they can learn more about their own cultures.
“One of them is the head of the Anthropology Department of Indonesia,” he says. “One of them just became the Head of the Economic and Social Commission for the AsiaPacific in Bangkok.” His Singaporean students include Goh Geok Yian. She is developing a digital Database for archaeological remains from the Singapore Cricket Club and is also an expert in Burmese history.
Dr Miksic is delighted that more and more Singaporeans are starting to become aware of our ancient past. Not only does this give us a deeper understanding of history; it also gives us a lot of pride as a nation. “We were not just a minor fishing village,” he reminds us. “We were actually an important place.”

https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/hazel-locke/story,"When Hazel Locke was a girl, her father often told her stories about his aunt, Agnes Joaquim (1854-1899). She was an Armenian Singaporean woman who created the famous Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid. 
Hazel Locke with a picture of her great-aunt, Agnes Joaquim and the trophy awarded by the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations (SCWO). Ms Joaquim was inducted into the SCWO Hall of Fame in 2015.
Every day, he would pick Hazel up from Raffles Girls’ School, which was then located in the city centre. Together, they would walk past the flower shops on the opposite side of Orchard Road, where the Cold Storage building was and The Centrepoint shopping mall stands today.
He would point to the huge metal tubs, full of Vanda Miss Joaquims, and describe how his aunt had created this flower. She had carefully crossed two different species of orchids: the Vanda hookeriana and the Vanda teres —something no-one had managed to do before. “He would cross his two forefingers to stress this point,” Mrs Locke says. “It wasn’t one time that he did this. It was every time.”
Her father was very proud of his aunt, and Hazel grew up feeling the same way about her great-aunt. She saw her flowers everywhere. Back then, many Singaporeans grew Vanda Miss Joaquims in their gardens. British soldiers would pack stalks of the orchids into long boxes and send them home as gifts.
National flower
Then, in 1981, the Singapore Tourism Board announced that they had chosen the Vanda Miss Joaquim as our national flower. A ceremony was held to celebrate the decision, and Mrs Locke’s uncle was invited to come to Singapore as the oldest surviving member of the Joaquim family.
To her surprise, her uncle told reporters that Ms Joaquim had not created the flower. He claimed she had discovered it in her garden in a clump of bamboo. “I slunk down in my seat,” Mrs Locke says. “I wanted to say, ‘Uncle Basil, this is not what my father told me.’” 
She knew her father was right. After all, her uncle had not even been born when Ms Joaquim took her plant to the Singapore Botanic Garden to show it to Henry N. Ridley, the director. But, she did not speak up as she did not want to disrespect her uncle. As a result, the sceptics believed that her great-aunt had merely found the flower by chance.
The real story
Over the next few decades, Mrs Locke gathered more information about Agnes Joaquim. She shared her research with historians, hoping that they could correct the misconceptions about her great-aunt.
Agnes Joaquim (1854 - 1899)
One of the documents she found was an article from a magazine, written in 1893 by Mr. Ridley. It clearly stated that Ms Joaquim had created the orchid through cross-breeding. It also said she was a well-known and award-winning horticulturalist — a person who uses scientific knowledge to grow plants.
Mrs Locke’s daughter, Linda Locke, built on her mother’s research by doing her own extensive investigations, along with that of Nadia Wright and Harold Johnson. As a result of these efforts, in 2016, the National Parks Board and National Heritage Board changed their official records to reflect accurately Agnes Joaquim’s achievement. As a 19th century Singaporean woman, she used her intelligence, perseverance and skill to develop a flower that is still loved by millions of people today.
Remarkable family
Agnes Joaquim is not the only remarkable member of Mrs Locke’s family. “My great uncle Joe Joaquim (1856-1902), a brother of Agnes, was an eminent lawyer and acclaimed criminal barrister. He was also Grand Master of the Singapore Masonic lodge,” explained Mrs Locke.
Joe Joaquim (1856-1902)
Her paternal grandfather, Eleazar Johannes (1854-1921), was an Armenian immigrant from Iran. He managed grand hotels like the Adelphi Hotel and the Sea View Hotel. (Quite a few Armenians were hotel managers, such as the Sarkies Brothers, who founded Raffles Hotel.)
Her mother’s side of rel=""noopener noreferrer"" the family was Portuguese; she is descended from Sir Jose D’Almeida (1784 – 1850), one of the early European settlers here. Originally a ship’s surgeon, he set up a trading firm and plantation. Although he was a very successful merchant, he still practiced as a doctor and opened a medical centre to help those in need. If you visit Raffles Place, you can still see a road named after him: D’Almeida Street.
Sir Jose D’Almeida (1784 – 1850)
When Mrs Locke was born in 1923, her family was quite rich. They had a car, which was a luxury in those days, and four maids: three Cantonese and one Malay. “My mother was spending money like there was no tomorrow!” she laughs. She still remembers enjoying Mickey Mouse cartoons at Capitol Cinema on weekend mornings.
Hard times
Sadly, her parents lost their fortune. For a while, her father managed an amusement park, but he eventually ended up unemployed. When she finished school, she had to turn down a university scholarship because she had to earn money. She worked as a dentist’s assistant, then as a telephone operator at Cold Storage Supermarket.
Mrs Locke has vivid memories of World War II. When the war reached Singapore, the family was reluctant to leave. But, as the battle for Singapore intensified, her father made a last-minute decision to arrange for his wife, daughters and youngest son to take refuge in India. 
Now, Mrs Locke is almost 94 years old. She lives near her daughter Linda, and is still alert and healthy. But, when she goes out, she is confused by all the new buildings and landmarks. “I know the street names, but I don’t know where I am,” she complains.
Nevertheless, she hopes she can contribute by sharing her memories with researchers. She can tell many tales about old Singapore, and how her family played an important part in our history.
- by Ng Yi-Sheng
Recent research identified the genus of these two parent orchids as Papilionanthe, instead of Vanda. As their scientific names are now Papilionanthe teres and Papilionanthe hookeriana, the national flower has been renamed Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim. Its common name remains Vanda Miss Joaquim.

“TINTIN BROUGHT ME HAPPINESS. I DID MY BEST AT WHAT I WAS DOING AND IT WASN’T ALWAYS EASY. BUT I HAD A LOT OF FUN. MOREOVER... I GOT PAID FOR DOING IT...”
— Hergé, 30 December 1975 —
From 5 November 2011 to 31 May 2012, the Singapore Philatelic Museum (SPM) celebrated one of the most beloved comic characters worldwide, the boy reporter Tintin. Created by Belgian comic artist Georges Remi (1907-1983) – also known as Hergé, Tintin is a teenage journalist who began a series of exciting adventures in 1929, accompanied by his faithful dog Snowy; and later his faithful friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus.
Tintin’s adventures, which spanned 24 comic books, took the young reporter and Snowy to various places around the world. They ventured into India, Tibet and China in Asia; to the Congo in Africa; Arabia in the Middle East; Russia in Europe; North and South America; and even the Moon!
Shown in this exhibition were stamps from SPM’s permanent collection. Also on display were a wide range of Tintin collectibles and rarely seen original stamp artworks on loan from the Museum Voor Communicatie in the Netherlands and L’Adresse Musée de La Poste in France.
Hergé – Creator of Tintin
It is difficult to separate Hergé’s life from his work. As a child, his sketches lined the margins of his exercise books. During his teenage years, he was always with his sketchbook, and his adult life was spent eternally stuck to his drawing board.
His fictional creation was part of him, living within him and playing key roles in his life. His life influenced his creation, and his creation influenced his life.
From youth to adulthood, Hergé drew alone, with the occasional one-off collaborations. His was the work of a master craftsman, and it came from his heart and his technical expertise. But when Hergé reached the age of 40, he began to favour working within a team and set up Studios Hergé in 1950.
Hergé’s studio allowed many talented artists to flourish and develop their own work. It became an institution dedicated to the conservation and exhibition of the clear line style. Hergé was the artistic director of Tintin magazine and the managing director of Studios Hergé. But he was more of a mentor than the boss of a company.
Scout’s Honour
In 1921, the young Hergé joined the Saint-Boniface College scout group. He was given the nickname ‘Curious Fox’.
“It was with scouting that the world really began to open up in front of me. It’s the greatest memory of my youth. Being close to nature, respecting nature, resourcefulness. It was all very important to me and even if it all seems a bit old-fashioned today, I still hold dear the values we learned.”
– Hergé, 1974
The budding artist was always with his sketchbook and pencil, sketching scenes of daily scout-life, landscapes from his travels and life portraits. The teenager quickly built up a good reputation for drawing such subjects.

“As I was a boy scout, I started telling the story of a little boy scout to other little boy scouts...these were not yet real comic strips. They were more like stories with illustrations and from time to time, a shy little exclamation mark or question mark”
Hergé, 1975
The scout’s honour he so strongly embraced put him through traumatic nightmares when he was working on Tintin in Tibet. During this time, he suffered from dreams of a white monster that represented the personal conflict he had over whether he should divorce his wife of three decades to be with a 22-year-old employee.
His journey began
After completing his studies in 1925, Hergé worked in the subscriptions department of the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle (‘The Twentieth Century’).
He was talent spotted by Father Norbert Wallez, director of Le Vingtième Siècle. Noting Hergé’s abilities in lettering and illustration, Father Wallez entrusted the young man with his first graphic design assignment, such as the designing of headings, layout of newspaper columns and creation of dropped initials, tailpieces and illustrations.
Three years later, Hergé was given his first real responsibility as an illustrator when he became the editor of Le Petit Vingtième (‘The Little Twentieth ’), the children’s supplement to Le Vingtième Siècle. The first issue was published on November 1 that year.
His creations
Hergé’s first drawings appeared in 1921 in Jamais assez, a scout magazine for schools; and then in Le Boy-Scout Belge, the monthly magazine of the Belgian scouts.
From 1924 onwards, he signed his drawings as Hergé, a phonetic transcription of his initials G.R. in the reverse (pronounced as ‘Air-Zhay’ in French).
He created Totor, Patrol Leader of the May Bugs, in Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. On 10 January 1929, Tintin and Snowy made their debut in Le Petit Vingtième. In 1930, Hergé introduced Quick and Flupke, street urchins from the backstreets of Brussels who starred in short stories in Le Petit Vingtième. Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was published by Editions du Petit Vingtième in the same year.
Cinema in a comic strip
Hergé’s work drew inspiration from the art of film-making. The plots, atmosphere and framing that constituted his picture stories were all heavily influenced by cinematic style. This led to his adventures, recorded in mere ink on paper, turning out to be as animated and expressive as full-length features shown in the cinema.
Hergé treated his characters as actors and he used current events and from history for his scenes. In this way, his frames and speech bubbles speak directly to us.
“I operate just like a film director. Firstly, there’s the scenario. In principle, I’m the scriptwriter as well ... It’s true that it’s very similar to the cinema. Then there’s the directing. The artist needs to be an actor and director simultaneously, and a draughtsman as well. He directs the actors. He has to feel when a character in a particular situation needs to run to the left or right or elsewhere. The artist also writes the dialogues, except in cases where there is a team with a scriptwriter and artist. In my case, I have to be everything at once.”
– Hergé, 1971
Man of letters
Hergé was a prolific writer. He was as demanding of his writing as he was of his drawing and painting. He left behind approximately 40,000 letters. While the majority were about his work, there were many that touched on love, his emotions and social life.
These writings bear witness to the author’s character and taste.
This is an extract of a letter he wrote to a young girl, Anne le B., from Casablanca. She had written to him about her teenage loneliness, thinking that she was writing to Hergé’s grandfather!
“Dear Miss,
In response to your esteemed letter of 20 June, I have the honour of letting you know: that I don’t have a beard, yet if I did have one, it would not be white, but just going grey; that as I don’t have a beard, my grandchildren can’t pull it; that furthermore I’m not a true grandparent as I have neither beard nor grandchildren; that part of the reason I’m not a grandparent may be because I’m not even a father; that I limit myself to having just one wife, because that’s the Belgian custom, in contrast to your area, where the custom is to have several; that I don’t have anyone who really is the living model for Captain Haddock; that I do generally receive and see the letters I am sent; that if some malevolent force had made your hand disappear, I would have been deprived of this pleasure; and lastly that I am very keen on writing back to you, and here is the proof! Is there still anything else to write? Since you haven’t asked me anything, I don’t even have the ability to refuse you anything. Basically, you have confided that you don’t even have a rat to talk to. If I understand it correctly, you’ve promoted me to that flattering role. I am clean-shaven (‘ras’ in French) and I could also be your rat, given that our conversation would be rudimentary and short-lived. It’s not only in fairy tales that a hideous beast can be transformed into Prince Charming, in the big round eyes of a 16-year old princess.”
Tintin’s trademarks
Famous Hairstyle
His little blond quiff. This quiff was formed only on pages 7-8 of Tintin in the Land of Soviets when he jumped into a car and raced away. The sudden acceleration gave him the distinctive quiff which became synonymous with Tintin. Since then the little tuft of hair never droops.
Plus-Four Pants
He is always dressed in a plain yellow or white collared shirt, often with a blue sweater over, and his trademark plus-four trousers. But he traded his plus-fours for bellbottoms in Tintin and the Picaros.
Who is Tintin?
  Tintin was definitely born of my unconscious desire to be perfect, to be a hero.
– Hergé.
Hergé has never confirmed who inspired him to create the Tintin character, and it may never be known who that was. But there are several claims.
Danish actor Palle Huld (1912-2010)
For decades he had claimed that his 44-day round-the-world trip, made in 1928 when he was a 15-year-old scout, was the inspiration to the appearance of Tintin a year later in Le Petit Vingtième.
French war and travel photo-journalist Robert Sexe (1890-1986)
Like Tintin, he rode a motorbike and had a best friend called René Milhoux (Tintin’s dog, Snowy, is called Milou in French). He also toured the Soviet Union, the Congo and America in the same order as Tintin in the first three comic issues.
Paul Remi, Hergé’s younger brother (1912-1986)
A military officer, Paul Remi’s likeness to the comic character prompted the nickname “Major Tintin” by his colleagues. That led him to shave off his hair and sport a ‘crew-cut’ look. Hergé reciprocated by using this new look to create the villainous character Colonel Sponz, who was featured for the first time in The Calculus Affair.
“My childhood companion and playmate was my brother, who was five years younger than me. I watched him, and he amused and fascinated me ... Undoubtedly, this explains how Tintin adopted his character, his gestures, his attitude.”
– Hergé, 1943
Last, but not least Herge&ecute; himself
The creator had claimed “Tintin, c’est moi” or “Tintin, it’s me.” ... “These are my eyes, my meaning, my lungs, my tripe! ... I believe that I am alone in being able to animate, in the sense of giving a soul.”
Know the cast
Hergé’s world was occupied by sharply defined characters. They were mostly inspired by real people who were either close to him, historical figures or celebrities at that time. Their portraits and psychological profiles had been meticulously composed, leaving nothing to chance.
>>Snowy
Tintin’s constant companion is an extraordinary white wire fox terrier. He is known as “Milou” in French. There are several stories on whom Snowy was named after. One version was that Snowy was named after Hergé’s girlfriend Marie-Louise Van Cutsem who was called “Malou”. Another candidate was René Milhoux, the best friend of French war and travel photojournalist Robert Sexe, who was himself one of many speculated inspirations of the Tintin character.
Snowy appeared right at the start, in the first drawing of the first adventure. He sticks by Tintin through good and bad times. He is faithful and courageous, saving Tintin in numerous adventures. He is known to be Tintin’s alter ego and his only confidant at the beginning.
>>Captain Archibald Haddock
The arrival of Captain Haddock does in some way replace Snowy. The Captain has always been a bit naïve, temperamental, loud, emotional and irritable, but he has a good heart and is always willing to help people who are in trouble.
His first appearance was on pages 14 and 15 of The Crab with the Golden Claws in 1941. He has been a seafaring captain of over 20 years. His ancestor was Knight François de Hadoque who commanded the frigate, the Unicorn.
Some of Captain Haddock’s distinctive features are his sailor outfit of black trousers, sailor’s hat and blue pullover with the image of an anchor; and a pipe in his mouth. His favourite exclamations are “Thundering Typhoons!” and “Blistering Barnacles!”
He is courageous but very clumsy, adding much comic relief to the stories. His main weakness is his excessive enjoyment of whisky and rum.
>>Chang Chong-Chen
This character was inspired by a young Chinese student of similar name, >张仲仁 (1907- 1998), whom Hergé met in 1934 when Chang was studying at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.
The extremely beneficial relationship inspired both Hergé’s professional and spiritual life. This marked a turning point in Hergé’s career, and was central to the creation of The Blue Lotus in 1935. Twenty-four years later Hergé celebrated his friendship with Chang again in Tintin in Tibet.
“I think that Chang was, without knowing it, one of the artists who had the most influence on me. He was a young Chinese student whom I had first met at the time when he helped me to create The Blue Lotus, and it was he who made me aware of the absolute necessity of being well informed about a country and of constructing a narrative.”
– Hergé, 29 April 1977
  Chang returned to China after he completed his studies in 1937. He became the Principal of the Shanghai Fine Arts Academy and was a celebrated sculptor.
The two good friends lost contact when World War Two broke out. The Japanese occupation of China during the war, coupled with the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), separated them for almost three decades. Hergé, however, never gave up looking for his friend. His long quest finally paid off in 1975, and they kept in contact through touching letters. It was not for another six years before Chang and Hergé had an emotional reunion in Brussels in 1981.
>>Thompson & Thomson
These two clumsy policemen first appeared in Cigars of the Pharaoh in 1932. They were then known as X33 and X33A. Their names were revealed only in King Ottokar’s Sceptre in 1939.
The only way to distinguish between the two is from the trim of their moustaches. Thompson’s is neatly trimmed, whilst Thomson’s has a distinctive twirl at the ends.
Both Thompson and Thomson are not very intelligent, and are incredibly clumsy and confused. They are hence full of blunders, misunderstandings, and always in trouble. One possible inspiration for the characters was Hergé‘s father, Alexis Remi, and Alexis’ twin brother, Léon. They were identical twins; both had moustaches, were dressed alike, wore boater or bowler hats, and held walking canes or umbrellas. Thompson and Thomson, however, are not twins.
Hergé could also have been inspired by movies of that time, namely the films of Charlie Chaplin, as well as the comedic duo Laurel and Hardy who shared similarities in characteristics with Thompson and Thomson.
Professor Cuthbert Calculus
He is an absolutely deaf and absent-minded inventor whose French name is Tryphon Tournesol. “Tryphon” is the name of Hergé’s carpenter and “Tournesol” means sunflower. He was actually modelled after a real person.
“Physically, Calculus and his submarine were based on Professor Auguste Piccard [1884-1962] and his bathyscaphe. He was a scaled down version of Piccard, who was much too tall. Piccard had a very long neck. I would occasionally bump into him in the street and he struck me as the incarnation of a typical scientist. I made Calculus a mini-Piccard, because otherwise I would have needed to enlarge the frames.”
– Hergé
Calculus’s deafness was modelled after Paul Eydt, the lawyer at Le Petit Vingtième. His deafness was a source of jokes amongst the editorial team.
>>Roberto Rastapopoulos
A dangerous Greek billionaire with the worst morals and taste in clothing, Rastapopoulos is a master of evil and the sworn enemy of Tintin.
His first appearance was in Tintin in America in 1932. He crossed paths with Tintin again in Cigars of the Pharaoh in 1934, The Blue Lotus in 1935, The Red Sea Sharks in 1958, and finally in Flight 714 in 1967.
He was modelled after the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis (1906-1975), who made a fortune constructing super tankers and became legendary for his wealth and display of it.
>>Dr. J.W. Müller
Violent and dangerous, enterprising and unscrupulous, and thoroughly evil, Dr Müller’s personality was based on Dr Georg Bell, a secret agent cum forger and a Nazi troublemaker of Scottish descent.
Physically, Dr Müller was based on the British actor Charles Laughton who starred in the film The Island of Doctor Moreau (1933). Laughton played the role of a mad genius, a pioneer of genetic modification and super surgeon, joining animals and humans together to create monstrous hybrids.
Dr Müller made his first appearance in The Black Island in 1938 as an outlaw and a master of disguise who often assumed multiple identities.
Celebrating Tintin through stamps
The Adventures of Tintin in 24 Albums
This 2007 stamp collection issued by the Belgium Post features the covers of all 24 titles of the Tintin comic book series, together with a portrait of Hergé.
Albums 2 to 9, which were originally in black and white, were republished in colour and in a fixed 62-page format between 1943 and 1947, as well as in 1955. Album 10 was the first to be published in colour right from the beginning. Albums 16 to 23 (and the revised editions of Albums 4, 7 and 15) were published with Studios Hergé.
A shortage of paper during World War Two had restricted the comics to 62 pages instead of the 100-130 pages allowed before the war.
The Double-Adventure Sequels
The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham’s Treasure were Hergé’s first attempt at dividing Tintin’s adventures into two parts.
The double-adventure was such a successful formula that Hergé repeated it in four other books. The second double-bill, which came right after Red Rackham’s Treasure, spanned The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun. The third double-adventure was told in Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon.
Hergé had attempted to create a sequel earlier in 1934 when he embarked on Tintin in the East in Le Petit Vingtième. But the resulting work, The Blue Lotus, was more of a companion volume rather than a straight sequel to the preceding book, Cigars of the Pharaoh.
Tintin on the Moon
Hergé’s world was filled with science and technology. He was an inquisitive artist who sought out and interviewed numerous scientific experts. The process reached its peak in Tintin’s adventure to the Moon.
Hergé had the ability to weave complicated scientific subject matters into truly remarkable stories. He drew inspiration from the space race between America and the Soviet Union in the 1950s, keeping close tabs on new developments in rocket science.
To ensure accuracy in his work, Hergé made a scale model of the Moon rocket to be featured in Destination Moon, and brought it to Paris for the approval of Professor Alexandre Ananoff, author of L’astronautique. The model could be dismantled to reveal each inner section clearly. Upon his return to Brussels, Hergé asked his assistants to draw the iconic red rocket based on his model.
“I wanted Bob De Moor [one of Hergé’s assistants] ... to know exactly whichever part of the space vehicle the characters were to be found in. It was essential that each detail was in place, that everything was perfectly exact: the venture was too dangerous for me to be involved without guarantee.”
– Hergé
Hergé was way ahead of his time. He put Tintin on the Moon in 1953, four years ahead of the Soviet Union which launched the first, unmanned, Sputnik rocket on 4 October 1957. And it was not until two decades later on 20 July 1969 that Neil Armstrong from the United States’ Apollo XI mission finally landed and set foot on the Moon. As a fitting outcome to this creative undertaking, Tintin became, in the eyes of many, the first man to walk on the Moon!
“This is it! ... I’ve walked a few steps! ... For the first time in history of mankind there is an Explorer on the Moon!” – Tintin declared in 1953, 16 years before Neil Armstrong’ declaration of “ one small step for man, one Gian leap for mankind”
Tintin comics have been made into movies since 1960, when Tintin first appeared on the big screen in Tintin and the Golden Fleece. This was followed by Tintin and the Blue Oranges in 1964.
In 1969, Belvision Studios in Brussels produced a feature-length animated cartoon based on the book Prisoners of the Sun. In 1976, Moi, Tintin, a full-length documentary about Tintin and his creator, hit the screens.
In October 2011, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, made its debut as a computer animated 3D movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie script was based on three of the comic stories: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham’s Treasure. A new set of stamps was issued by bpost (Belgium Post) on 27 August 2011 to mark this special occasion.
