    st.write("""Archaeological finds found in Singapore waters and land are documented in archaeological site reports made available\
            on sources like NUS E-Press (https://epress.nus.edu.sg/sitereports/). However, the site reports are typically in an\
            unstructured text format. The format may also vary across different authors or organisations researching on the archaeological\
            site. This makes it challenging to build up a list of vocabularies (or categories) commonly used to describe the\
            archaeological finds.""")

    st.write("""With the use of LLM, it is expected to cut down the manual effort required to look through the site reports\
            and rationalise the list of categories used to describe the archaeological finds. The new process will involve\
            users to focus on newly suggested categories and their corresponding rationale for suggesting the categories\
            as generated by LLM.""")

    Data on archaeological finds are extracted from NUS E-Press (https://epress.nus.edu.sg/sitereports/). Supplementary data on\
